Whizz Education’s research shows that 46% of the 1,721 children assessed experienced a learning loss, exhibiting an average of knowledge decline of eight months during the first lockdown.\\nDr Junaid Mubeen, Director of Education explains: “Learning loss is such a loaded term. At Whizz we simply take it to mean a decline in students’ knowledge levels, which is hardly surprising in the face of severe disruptions this past year. Despite the tireless efforts of teachers to adapt lessons and provide remote classes, the global pandemic has had a drastic effect on pupils’ learning. “We found that pencil and paper multiplication was the skill that fared worst, along with pencil and paper addition, both demonstrating more than six months of knowledge declines across the sample.\\n“Knowledge declines were less severe in topics such as integers, powers and roots and also decimals (5 months’ learning loss). Children studying these topics are generally older, however, so these findings reflect similar studies we have conducted in other regions around the world, where younger pupils with a limited store of knowledge to draw on, suffered a higher degree of learning loss.\\n“It is also likely that those in our underserved communities have been hardest hit – a sad consequence of the pandemic is that it has exacerbated the attainment gap, with disadvantaged students falling further behind due to lack of access to online learning during school closures. We’ve observed this in both the UK and globally.\\n“While we recognise that some students have lost almost a year’s worth of maths knowledge, when addressing how best to move forwards it is important that teachers are not put under further pressure, or that students are made to feel penalised, for events which have, frankly, been out of their control. We should not expect quick fixes; it will take months, even years, for students to regain any lost ground. The emphasis needs to be on informal assessment of gaps and ensuring each student receives individualised support that addresses their specific knowledge gaps. Virtual tutors can play an important part in the battle against learning loss, without inducing further burdens on teachers.\\n“At Whizz Education, we believe that every child deserves a learning experience that caters to their individual needs and pace of learning. We work closely in partnership with schools to develop quality bespoke learning programmes delivered via our virtual tutoring platform, Maths-Whizz. Maths-Whizz uses powerful AI to build a completely personalised plan for each child, and then continues to tailor it as they complete lessons.\\n“Maths-Whizz provides more than 1,250 pre-prepared lesson plans, assisting teachers to deliver measurable learning gains for children with a range of abilities. Our research shows with just 60 minutes per week of Maths-Whizz over a six-week summer period, students can expect to acquire a 4-month learning advantage. This year of all years, this seems like too great an opportunity to pass up.”\\nTo find out more about Whizz Education and the Maths-Whizz virtual tutor please see: www.whizzeducation.com',\n"," 'A\\xa0brand-new Virtual Schools Archery League, launching this June, is helping schools engage in Covid-safe interschool sports, while also encouraging students to enjoy the benefits of competitive archery.\\nLed by The School Archery League (SAL) and supported by Archery GB, the accessible competition helps set a new challenge for pupils that supports mental focus, promotes fun and provides the benefits of physical activity – all in a socially distant way. The Virtual Schools Archery League is open to all schools across the country, with separate divisions for barebow and recurve bows as well as abilities. Shooting can take place indoors or outdoors to suit the school’s facilities.\\nOver the past year, various lockdowns and periods of home-schooling have meant physical activity has been restricted for many pupils, with a negative impact on both physical and mental wellbeing. As a naturally socially-distanced activity, archery is the perfect sport to get pupils moving and motivated again.\\nSchools joining the Virtual Schools Archery League are invited to submit one or more groups for entry, who will then compete against other schools within the same category. Teachers record and submit each archer’s top scoring shooting round virtually during the competition period, and a winner is announced every half term.\\nSarah Gibbs, SAL Coordinator says: “We want to get as many pupils as possible across the country involved in the League and having a go at archery. It’s a great sport that everyone can enjoy – and with in-person inter-school competitions currently limited, the Schools Archery League is a great way for students to enjoy an inclusive, competitive sport, in a safe and socially-distanced way.\\n“We think students will really enjoy the thrill when they hit the target and can see their aim improve over time. Of course, a bit of friendly competition between schools makes for added excitement too!”\\nNeil Armitage, CEO of Archery GB said, “The Virtual Schools Archery League is a fantastic initiative and one that we hope really encourages more students to get involved in the sport. Archery is well-recognised as an inclusive sport that is accessible to all ages and abilities, so it also helps engage those that are perhaps not naturally drawn to sports. Covid-19 has had a significant impact on physical activity across the board, and archery is an ideal sport for post-Covid times to help boost mental and physical wellbeing.”\\nAccessible across the spectrum regardless of age, physical ability or gender, archery is a uniquely inclusive sport. As one of very few that sees disabled and non-disabled participants and those of all ages compete against each other on level terms, archery truly breaks down barriers and creates an accessible path to sporting fun for all levels of abilities and fitness.\\nWith physical benefits such as improved stamina and upper body strength, mental benefits of improved control, enhanced focus and boosted self-confidence, students also benefit from the social and competitive aspects of competing alongside their teammates.\\nThis summer, Archery GB will once again be leading The Big Weekend event (9 – 11 July), which this year will be preceded by The Big Week (5 – 9 July), encouraging even more people to have a go at the inclusive sport. With a whole host of activities, including taster sessions, social events, fun games and archery challenges there will be plenty of opportunities to try the inclusive sport at clubs, venues, centres and schools nationwide – perfect for the 77% of British adults who wish they’d been able to try archery during school PE.\\nTo find out more about the Virtual School Archery League, schools should email\\xa0CFCARCHERY@gmail.com.\\nFor more information on archery, including The Big Week and The Big Weekend, please visit\\xa0www.archerygb.org.\\nFor more on getting started with archery, head to\\xa0www.startarchery.co.uk.',\n"," 'Tens of thousands of students age 14-19 across the UK are set to benefit from a raft of new free, peer created digital resources to help them negotiate a wide range of complex life and world issues.\\nThe innovative Role Models programme and set of resources sees students studying at universities across Sussex, tackling the life issues they with they’d known more about when they were younger to provide practical help to younger students. The programme is one of a wide range of innovative programmes funded by the Office for Students through the Sussex Learning Network, which supports over 10,000 young people a year to make informed education and life choices.\\nThe digital Role Model series already features booklets and videos on issues such as ‘Worry’, ‘Gender & Sexuality’ and ‘The Climate Emergency’ and will this week be joined by two new resources tackling ‘Body Positivity’ and ‘Fake News’.\\nThe new online resources are free to use and available to all and can be found at\\nhttps://www.sussexlearningnetwork.org.uk/lisetoolkits/Role-Models-Resource-Books\\nEach themed booklet contains hints, tips and advice, personal accounts from the Role Models as well as interactive exercises and links to relevant news articles, recommended social media accounts and helplines. Dedicated Teacher Resource packs are also available that provide themed, timed out lesson plans for each topic.\\nImogen, Role Model and Acting for Film Student, University of Chichester, commented: “I really enjoy the creativity of thinking through the best way to approach a challenging issue to make it accessible. I almost speak to my younger self and think ‘right Imogen, what should I tell you?’.\\xa0 Feeling that the advice I’m giving might help even one young person makes everything I do 100% worthwhile and makes me really proud.”\\nThe new Role Models Body Positivity booklet and video – created by young people including Imogen with the supervision of educators – tackles everything from the drive for perfection in the age of social media to gender identity and body dysphoria; while the Fake News resources explore the growing prevalence of false information, the impact of sharing it, why it’s damaging and how to spot it.\\nDebra Vice-Holt, Programme Manager at SLN said: ‘Role Models is the ultimate win-win education programme. It helps younger students explore important life issues that they might find difficult to discuss with older adults, and equips Role Models with communication, presentation and writing skills that increase their confidence and employability.’\\nTo find out more about Role Models or any of Sussex Learning Network’s wide range of education programmes go to www.sussexlearningnetwork.org.uk.',\n"," 'All Saints School in Dagenham has landed a gold standard award for its outstanding mental health and wellbeing provision.\\nThe school has been awarded the School Mental Health Award by the Carnegie Centre of Excellence for Mental Health in Schools after being found to be excelling in all eight areas of the award framework.\\nHeadteacher Clare Cantle said: “This award recognises that we, as a staff body and school community, care for one another: we express this care in so many ways, and it is humbling to know that it is being celebrated so positively.\\n“During months of lockdowns, our staff maintained their relationships with our families both in school for key workers and online.\\n“I especially consider the weekly newsletter with its holistic content to have been a personal and purposeful way to promote the bonds we have all nurtured over the years and to educate our young people no matter the obstacles.\\n“What we have learnt from this troubling period is that All Saints staff are there for all, all the time”.\\nThe school was particularly praised for its work to support parents and pupils during lockdowns, with resources and workshops to help parents support their child’s mental health and additional sessions for parents to speak to teachers if they needed to.\\nAll staff at the school are trained in mental health to offer pupils the best possible first-line support, and there is plenty in place to support their wellbeing too.\\nThe school fully supports flexible working and striking a work-life balance. Staff have a strong sense of community and get involved in various social events and physical activities to support their mental health.\\nCouncillor Evelyn Carpenter, Cabinet Member for School Improvement and Educational Attainment, said: “This is great news and a tribute to the creativity, care, skill and dedication of the excellent staff at All Saints School.\\n“Despite the difficulties posed by the pandemic, All Saints Catholic School has continued to improve the health and wellbeing of its staff and pupils.”',\n"," 'A careers project has enabled Fylde Coast students to explore the world of science, as part of a wider programme to help young people explore the benefits of further and higher education.\\nYear nine and 10 students from Montgomery High School, South Shore Academy, Cardinal Allen and Fleetwood High have been participating in the Science Capital project, which was created to stimulate interest in STEM subjects and make students aware of the related career paths and opportunities available.\\nStudents have been benefitting from a range of industry insights, from group coaching sessions with Lancaster University Physics PhD students and demonstrations including exciting pyrotechnics displays at Blackpool Sixth Form, to career assemblies and virtual tours of the LUniverse planetarium at Lancaster University. Delayed due to the pandemic, sessions were recorded and made available to be delivered in class or at home, to also help encourage parents to broaden their interest in science.\\nThe project was led by Mhairi Mitchinson, Assistant Head of the Department of Science at the Blackpool Sixth Form College, in partnership with Lancaster University Physics Department and Future U.\\nMhairi, a former engineer, established the Fylde Coast Ogden Trust Partnership in 2012, with Blackpool Sixth Form as the hub school. The Ogden Trust is a charitable trust which was created to promote the teaching and learning of physics.\\nShe said: “I have always been passionate about opening doors to all young students to study STEM subjects and overcoming barriers that might stop a student from achieving. The project built on the work we have been doing over the past decade in the Blackpool area and has been received very well. It is such a pleasure to work with such dedicated teachers, students and staff to help inspire our next generation.”\\nJessica Richmond, Senior Coordinator, at Future U, added: “As the Science Capital project was initially delayed due to the pandemic, it’s fantastic to see how effectively the delivery has been adapted to ensure students aren’t missing out on these vital engagement opportunities, while prioritising safety.\\n“It’s important to make careers outreach interesting for not only pupils, but parents and guardians too, as their support is so important when it comes to young people exploring what may be possible in their futures beyond school. There are so many educational and career pathways relating to science, and we’ve been thrilled with the feedback from students who have now been exposed to potential careers they may never have considered previously.”\\nDr Andy Blake, Lecturer in Physics and the Physics Outreach Coordinator at Lancaster University, said: “It is a pleasure to work on this exciting schools engagement project in partnership with Blackpool Sixth Form College and Future U. It has never been more important to support the learning and career aspirations of young people in Blackpool and the Fylde Coast. By providing pupils with opportunities to interact with our staff and students in online lessons and assemblies, we aim to show them that science is open to everyone.”\\nFuture U is part of the national Uni Connect Programme, funded by the Office for Students, and continues to support school pupils across Lancashire to encourage more young people to think about higher education and future careers.\\nIt involves institutions and organisations across the county including the University of Central Lancashire, Lancaster University, Edge Hill University and the University of Cumbria.\\nLancashire’s Future U works with a network of schools, in addition to colleges, higher education providers and local agencies to create tailored activities to meet the needs of students for now and the future.\\nFuture U’s list of partners includes: Blackburn College, Blackpool Sixth Form College, Blackpool and the Fylde College, Burnley College, Edge Hill University, Inspira, Kendal College, Lancaster University, Myerscough College, Nelson and Colne College, Preston’s College, STEMFirst, Runshaw College, The Lancashire Colleges, University of Central Lancashire, University of Cumbria and West Lancashire College.\\nwww.lancashirefutureu.org.uk',\n"," 'The Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Programme has partnered with educational charity, Smart School Councils, on a programme of activities to hear the views of children and young people about the historic restoration of the Palace of Westminster.\\nChildren and young people will be able to take part in the debates in school through the Smart School Councils’ Big Debate Club, a model which provides teachers with a range of free classroom and online activities.\\nThe debates will engage students of all ages and abilities with questions and topics about the different elements of the restoration and renewal programme, enabling children to learn more about the Palace of Westminster and express their opinions and perspectives on the importance of the project.\\nSarah Johnson, CEO, Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Sponsor Body said: “As we get on with the job of developing the plan to restore the iconic Houses of Parliament, it is important to remember that children and young people are the future custodians of this historic building.

This is neither governed, directed or limited by Ofsted inspection framework, handbook or the actual inspection visit process. Ofsted is therefore neither a matrix of what we must do as a school, nor the main indicator of whether we are superb at what we help our students achieve.\\xa0Ofsted can, however, be a very helpful additional moderator of a school’s effectiveness and so, with that in mind, I always welcome another view and perspective.\\n“Our engagement in the pilot provided a brilliant opportunity to pause – after a very turbulent time of the pandemic operation – and invite an external view of whether the ambition we have for our students, and the ways in which we support them, is solid.\\nMrs Hildrey added: “I am delighted with the appraisal received and it re-affirmed our own evidence that the school is outstanding, particularly in the most complex area of positive behaviour support, personal development and raising aspirations for adulthood and independence.\\n“As ever, the more you look, the more you find and it was equally helpful to have four pairs of “fresh” eyes, with no prior knowledge of our school, give us feedback on what we could do better. We are actively working through all of the pointers and will include them in our work this term and in the coming year.”\\nMrs\\xa0Hildrey\\xa0concluded: “As a school we are also committed to improving practice beyond our own walls and so, I am personally very pleased to have been given an opportunity to shape Ofsted’s approach to inspecting special schools and I trust that my feedback will enhance the experience for other schools – and for us, too, as we are in the “inspection window” any time soon!”',\n"," 'The Schools & Academies Show and EdTech Update took place last week, as fully interactive virtual experiences from 27th – 30th April 2021.\\nBoth shows were co-located online to allow the 3,700+ education leaders from Schools, Colleges and Universities in attendance to seamlessly visit both events.\\nThe virtual event format allowed attendees to peruse an online exhibition, tune-in to live panels discussions, take part in live roundtables, workshops and networking sessions, whilst also having access to over 50 hours of CPD-certified best-practice case studies and presentations.\\nThe Schools & Academies Show kicked off with a highly topical presentation from Mufti Hamid Patel, CEO of Star Academies, who provided practical leadership lessons from his experience building Star Academies into one of the country’s foremost academy trusts.\\nEdTech Update started with an exciting keynote address from our Platinum Sponsor; Computacenter, with Adam Levy, Head of Digital Solutions at Computacenter and Jermaine Sutton, Education Executive at Microsoft discussing ‘Remote not Removed: The New Era of Digital Education’.\\nAfter Gavin Williamson’s announcement during the week of the show regarding the government’s vision for every school to become part of a family of schools in a strong multi-academy trust, we also hosted a timely session after this announcement from Baroness Berridge, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the School System.\\nBaroness Berridge’s presentation entitled ‘Coming Out of Covid-19 and the Future of Academy Trusts’ stated:\\n“This is not about ideology and structural change in and of itself. Our ambition is for more schools to benefit from being part of a strong family because Multi-Academy Trusts and their schools exist to advance education for the public benefit.”\\nAfter another hugely successful virtual show, providing school and education leaders with a platform to listen, learn and network with peers, the next exciting venture will be the return of physical shows, with the Schools & Academies Show Birmingham and EdTech Summit 2021 taking place on 17th & 18th November at the NEC.\\nChris Callaghan, Event Director, Schools & Academies Show and EdTech Summit stated;\\n“The virtual format and event platform has provided us with an invaluable tool to ensure we continue to reach school leaders and support our community within the sector.

students will have two training sessions and one class a day for 3 days a week, and will achieve a NCFE qualification, the same as they’d receive at a typical college of further education. During the courses however, they will also have the benefit of competitive games on a Wednesday.\\nBoth courses at Birmingham Moseley Rugby Club will begin in September 2021 and are open for enrolment now. To apply, click here: https://www.wearescl.co.uk/birmingham-rugby\\nTravis McIntyre, who runs the academy, said: “We’re so excited to announce that we’ll be running two brand new courses from September, it’s something that we’ve been wanting to expand into for a while now and because of the popularity of football and women’s rugby around Birmingham, we’re sure we’ll have some incredible players join us.\\n“We started the academy in 2014, exclusively running men’s rugby courses, but it’s been so successful that we’re sure we have the expertise and knowledge to replicate this into a football course and, adapt the knowledge we already have for the women’s rugby classes.\\n“Our past rugby students have gone on to gain full scholarships at universities and play in the Birmingham Moseley Rugby Club’s team, so while we are primarily a rugby club, we appreciate all sport and are excited to expand our student base to football, as well as rugby.”\\nThe first information evening is Monday 17th May at 7pm in the Reddings Suite at Birmingham Moseley Rugby Club, subject to Government guidelines.',\n"," 'Millions of UK children will be invited to tune in to one big school assembly as they are encouraged to take on a special 100 challenge as part of a brand-new fundraising initiative.\\nThe Captain Tom 100 is being organised by The Captain Tom Foundation with London Marathon Events to celebrate Captain Tom’s life, his generosity of spirit the hope and the joy he brought to millions and his sense of fun.\\nThe morning announcements and school notices will be replaced for one day only with a YouTube broadcast with Hannah Ingram-Moore, daughter of Captain Sir Tom, and featuring a special message from PE star Joe Wicks which will be played simultaneously in classrooms across the country and around the world on 30th April – which would have been Captain Tom’s 101st birthday.\\nTo join in, children will be asked to take part in a challenge of their choice centred around the number 100.\\nHannah Ingram-Moore, youngest daughter of the Second World War veteran who raised more than £39million for the NHS by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday, said: “To inspire, excite and engage with young people, we have a fabulous film featuring famous faces and unsung heroes showing us what they will be doing for their Captain Tom 100 challenge. From David Beckham to five-year-old Betty Leigh Allinson, there’s inspiration for every age and every ability.\\n“We love the idea of millions of children watching the same thing at the same time and then running, hopping, skipping, dancing, baking, sewing, writing, drawing or whatever else they might want to do to raise money.\\n“Children are a primary focus of this campaign which celebrates inclusivity and diversity and allows absolutely everyone to do their little bit in my father’s memory. Let’s continue what my father started. It’s continuing where he left off.”\\nThe assembly will be just one part of a school-centred focus, appealing to secondary and primary schools to get stuck into the fundraising mission.\\nThose taking part will be asked to take on their 100 challenge between Friday, April 30, and the Bank Holiday Monday on May 3 but Ms Ingram-Moore said she suspected many schools would choose to engage in a communal activity on the Friday – which would have been Captain Sir Tom’s birthday.\\nHannah added: “We are picturing, with sheer delight, children on playing fields up and down the country doing 100 star jumps, 100 hula hoops or skipping 100 times. We believe schools will really want to engage with this event because my father had such a tremendous impact on young people during the height of the pandemic. He simply loved children and showed them that anything was possible.”\\nSchools will be invited to stream the special assembly to pupils on the morning of Friday 30th April but can access the material anytime from the 26th April.\\nOn top of this, education packs are available for participating schools to download from the Captain Tom 100 website from 12th April. These will include a host of resources to suit different age groups, including from the National Literacy Trust and White Rose Maths.\\nJonathan Douglas, chief executive of the National Literacy Trust, said: “We are very proud to be supporting the Captain Tom 100. The fantastic thing about this initiative is you can choose your own challenge and we’re so excited to see how schools and children interpret the theme.\\n“Captain Sir Tom Moore achieved great things and inspired hope during a really difficult time, encouraging everyone to look positively to the future.\\n“In our own research, one in two children said that reading encourages them to dream about the future. That’s why we’ve come up with lots of fun literacy ideas around the number 100 that pupils can do as part of their learning in the classroom or at home to be part of this brilliant campaign bringing the nation together on Captain Tom’s birthday.”\\nCaroline Hamilton, director of White Rose Maths, said the organisation is proud to support the Captain Tom 100 initiative.\\nShe added: “Along with millions of others across the country, the White Rose Maths team was truly inspired by this extraordinary gentleman’s effort and commitment, and we’re excited to be playing our part in celebrating his many achievements.\\n“What better way for us to do this than to take a close look at the number 100! It’s a genuinely fascinating number, and we’re looking forward to sharing lots of ways in which children, teachers, parents and carers can explore it in much more detail.”\\nChildren who take part can also download a certificate of achievement.\\nThe event is being supported by London Marathon Events, the Mass Participation Sports Organisers (MSO), Prominent PR, adam&eveDDB, LiveWire Sport and Studio Republic.\\nTo take part visit https://www.captaintom100.com/ and use the hashtag #CaptainTom100 to share your efforts across social media channels.',\n"," 'The organisers of the annual UK Robotics Week celebration – now the UK Festival of Robotics – have announced the return of their robot drawing and story competitions, inviting primary schoolchildren nationwide to share their robot-inspired creativity with a team of top judges.

The project will look at how COVID-19 has impacted primary school libraries and imagines the future of library provision in the primary sector.\\nPrimary school libraries are a critical part of the school learning environment, providing not only access to a diverse range of books and resources but also to a quiet and safe place to read. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, school libraries were under pressure, with 1 in 10 primary and secondary schools in the UK not having a library at all.\\nLibrary provision also varies significantly across the country, with schools in more disadvantaged communities less likely to have good library provision. Schools with a higher proportion of children eligible for free school meals are more than twice as likely not to have a designated library space onsite.\\nNearly 2 in 3 (63%) of UK primary and secondary students use their school library – and children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely than their better-off peers to use the service. COVID-19 and the necessary closure of schools and libraries is likely to have a detrimental impact on pupils that rely on these spaces and resources.\\nThis review follows the expansion of Puffin World of Stories, an award-winning collaboration between Penguin Random House UK and the National Literacy Trust which has reached 225 schools over the last three years with nearly 80,000 books donated. The programme aims to offer practical solutions to some of the challenges facing reading for pleasure in schools where budget constraints often mean investing in school libraries is not an option. Schools receive bespoke training, hundreds of free books and colourful resources to help bring their reading spaces to life. Author and actor Nathan Bryon was announced as the first Puffin World of Stories ambassador last month.\\nJonathan Douglas CBE, CEO of the National Literacy Trust said: “We are proud to be launching this important piece of work and are looking forward to seeing the submissions. This is an opportunity for the sector and families to come together to review what a good primary school library provision would look like and what steps are needed to get there.\\n“Primary school libraries are a key element in the academic recovery of children following the three national lockdowns. There is no greater time to be collating evidence of their fundamental importance as we try and support the youngest generation’s learning and literacy.”\\nFrancesca Dow, Managing Director of \\u200ePenguin Random House Children’s said: “Every child should have the opportunity to discover the magic of reading in school, and yet we know that library provision in primary schools is patchy – despite so many teachers and librarians’ best efforts. By funding this vital review of the role of primary school libraries, we hope to show how important libraries and reading for pleasure will be to our post-COVID national recovery.”\\nThe call for evidence is targeted at librarians, teachers, schools, organisations and charities within the education space and organisations working with libraries and will be open until June 25th.\\nFor more information, please visit https://literacytrust.org.uk/policy-and-campaigns/primary-school-library-review/.',\n"," 'Road safety charity Brake has announced the return of its road safety campaign Brake’s Kids Walk. On Wednesday 16 June 2021, thousands of schoolchildren across the UK will take part in a short, supervised walk to promote important road safety messages. Children will walk in pairs in crocodile formation within their community, to emphasise the importance of being able to walk without fear or threat from traffic or pollution.\\nChildren of all ages are at risk of being hurt or killed when walking near roads. On average, six children are killed or seriously injured on roads in Britain every day – that’s equivalent to a whole classroom of children every week.\\nBy signing up to Brake’s Kids Walk, schools and educators can access a FREE action pack featuring lesson plans, assemblies, activities, and posters, all brightly illustrated and featuring the popular Shaun the Sheep characters by Aardman. As well as teaching children vital road safety skills, Brake’s Kids Walk raises awareness among parents and other adults of the need to protect children on our roads. Posters and demonstration materials highlight what children need to be able to walk safely in their communities: they need footpaths, cycle paths, safe places to cross, and slow and clean traffic.\\nBrake, the road safety charity, has been running walking events for schoolchildren at a national level for more than 15 years. The charity is also behind Road Safety Week – the UK’s biggest road safety campaign each November.\\nAll schools and education communities are invited to sign up to Brake’s Kids Walk 2021 at\\xa0www.brake.org.uk/kidswalk.\\nBrake’s Kids Walk 2021 is sponsored by esure.\\nScott Williams, head of programme delivery at Brake, said: “It’s every child’s right to be able to walk in their community without fear of traffic and pollution. Throughout the pandemic families have taken to the streets on foot and by bike and we hope these activities will continue as restrictions lift and ordinary road traffic returns. It is vital that children are able to walk safely in the places where they live. This year we hope to inspire as many children, schools and families as possible through our Brake’s Kids Walk event.”\\nDavid McMillan, CEO at esure Group added: “We are thrilled to have partnered with Brake to sponsor this year’s event as we believe in the importance of road safety for children everywhere. We want to be a force for good and make a real difference by focusing on better and safer driving.

The nurse degree apprenticeship is a work-based qualification providing apprentices with a combination of training and assessments via distancing learning and on-site placements applying practical knowledge. Placements will be delivered at a Spire hospital as well as at the local NHS trust and GP practice.\\nApprentices enjoy a flexible, work-based approach, combining university study and workplace learning to develop new knowledge, skills and thinking whilst completing a degree. The benefit of the degree apprenticeship route is the ability to earn while learning, with a salary of between £18,000 and £21,000 depending on previous experience.\\nEach nurse degree apprenticeship will complete the programme with a BSc degree. Applications are open now, with successful applicants starting the programme in July 2021.\\nDeborah Barker, Group Talent Manager at Spire Healthcare, commented, “We are thrilled to be launching our new nurse degree apprenticeship programme. Delivered in partnership with the University of Sunderland it offers hundreds of people, from school leavers, university graduates or people looking to retrain, the opportunity to earn while they learn. Nurses have a vital role in delivering care and support to patients while in hospital and this programme helps to introduce more people into the profession.\\n“The appeal of an apprenticeship has risen in recent years due to the increasing cost of the traditional university degree route. Covid-19 has then compounded this with classroom-based teaching disrupted over the course of 2020/21.\\n“The programme has been developed to give people broad experience of healthcare in England, they will complete placements in Spire hospitals, NHS hospitals, and in the community. This ensures that every apprentice gets a full-rounded experience of the role and is well-prepared for their future career in the sector.”\\nSimone Bedford, Team Leader Professional Healthcare Practice and Midwifery at University of Sunderland, said: “We are excited to be working with Spire Healthcare as this is a great opportunity to work with partners in the private sector.\\n“The Registered Nurse Degree Apprenticeship will be delivered nationally within the Spire Healthcare group and will offer greater flexibility than a traditional degree to the 270 new nursing apprentices. Based on the University of Sunderland’s successful experience elsewhere, this ‘grow your own’ model is a very exciting development for everyone concerned and we commend Spire Healthcare for its initiative in embarking on such a programme.”\\nSpire’s nurse degree apprenticeship programme is open to applicants from people 18 years and over.

New sections on play, characteristics of effective learning, and self-regulation are designed to help practitioners to reflect on and develop their own pedagogy.\\n“The guidance includes detailed examples of trajectories of development and learning in all the prime and specific areas,” says Nancy Stewart, Project Lead.\\xa0 “The need for this information to support child development knowledge came through very clearly in our consultations.”\\nBut she cautions that a new mindset is needed across the sector, to move away from a checklist approach that takes practitioners away from being with children. “If settings have been using previous guidance as a checklist, they should not see Birth to 5 Matters as a replacement to be used in that way,” she says.\\xa0 “Instead, it is a support for informed professional judgement that will help practitioners move to a new way of understanding and supporting children’s learning, with a minimalist approach to recording assessment.’\\nThe Early Years Coalition is currently planning for training materials and events to introduce practitioners to using Birth to 5 Matters, as well as to support professional development in areas that have been highlighted through the consultations.\\nThe launch at 7pm on Wednesday 31 March will be streamed live at https://www.facebook.com/birthto5matters, and a recording of the event will be available after the launch at https://www.birthto5matters.org.uk/ .',\n"," 'Assessing the efficacy of ventilation with CO2 monitors has been identified as a key strategy for enabling a safe and COVID-Secure return to work and school.\\nFor workplaces and schools, a safe reopening during the ongoing pandemic can only be achieved with a robust risk-reduction strategy that covers all transmission routes. Since one of the primary ways that COVID-19 is spread is through the air by aerosols – airborne liquid particles that may carry infection – keeping these particles out of the nearby air by regularly introducing clean and fresh air into communal spaces (i.e. ventilating) is vital for preventing the spread of disease.\\nSo how do you ventilate spaces effectively? And how do you know if ventilation practices are even working?\\nThe UK Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), along with The Chartered Institute of Building Service Engineers (CIBSE) (UK) and the Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations (REHVA) (Europe), have issued\\xa0guidelines on how to improve ventilation in rooms. Their advice includes opening windows, ensuring regular breaks for occupants and increasing mechanical ventilation.\\nAll three reports also highlight\\xa0CO2 monitoring as a key tool for any effective ventilation strategy, both to help improve ventilation and to help assess its efficacy.\\nWhy is CO2 monitoring important?\\nFeeling that a room has become ‘stuffy’ or feeling drowsy after hours sat in a meeting room are sensations that are familiar to many-and they’re caused by a\\xa0build-up of CO2.\\nJust like CO2, aerosols carrying infectious diseases that are exhaled by occupants will linger in the air without sufficient ventilation.\\xa0The longer that a room is occupied, the greater the volume of infectious aerosols that will build up, and the greater the risk of infection.\\nIt is possible to evaluate the level of ventilation available in a room just by assessing how occupants are feeling. For example, if a person perceives that a room feels ‘stuffy’, they may proceed to open a window to increase air flow rates. However, this method is ultimately reliant on guesswork, and occupants may not be able to detect simply by feeling alone when extra ventilation is needed until it is too late.\\nMonitoring CO2 levels eliminates guesswork from ventilation assessment and enables a\\xa0systematic approach to increasing ventilation. By accurately measuring the volume of CO2 in the air,\\xa0CO2 monitors\\xa0provide hard evidence of when extra ventilation is needed – which might be a long time before occupants feel that the room could do with some fresh air.\\nThe report from SAGE identifies that\\xa0CO2 monitoring is particularly important in workplaces and schools, where it is most likely to be an effective indicator of ventilation rates.\\nIn spaces that are used for extended durations by groups, i.e. offices and classrooms, CO2 measurements reflect the air quality with a greater accuracy and give a good indication of ventilation conditions.\\nBy contrast, CO2 monitoring is not as effective at indicating ventilation rates in large volume or low occupancy spaces, where airflow and dispersion of occupants may vary. In these areas, however, SAGE still recommends aiming to\\xa0keep CO2 levels low (below 800ppm)\\xa0as a good rule of thumb.\\nHow to improve ventilation with CO2 monitoring\\nAfter establishing what ventilation is available in a room,\\xa0CO2 monitors\\xa0should be used for two purposes:\\n\\nto alert when extra ventilation is needed\\nto evaluate the efficacy of ventilation\\n\\nCO2 monitors should be placed on an inside wall, with sensors facing away from windows or grilles so that the readings are as accurate to the inside conditions as possible. It is also recommended that they are placed in visible positions c. 1.5m off of the ground so that responsible persons can easily act upon their alerts.\\n\\nAlarms show when extra ventilation is needed\\nAlarms on\\xa0CO2 monitors\\xa0can alert occupants of the immediate need to increase ventilation in a room by signalling that the CO2 concentration has exceeded acceptable levels.\\nAs a visual indicator, CO2 alarms also help to\\xa0boost awareness of the importance of ventilation. The CIBSE report suggests that involving school pupils in responding to CO2 alerts can help to increase ventilation efficacy by improving awareness.\\nThe reports suggest that alarms should be set to alert\\xa0when the CO2 concentration measures at or above 1000ppm. If or when an alarm is triggered, action should be taken to immediately increase air flow into the occupied space. Opening high windows is an effective strategy, especially in colder months, as it will sufficiently increase ventilation rates while not significantly lowering room temperature or causing a draught.\\nFor schools with mechanical ventilation systems, the reports recommended maximising fresh air flow at all times.\\n\\nTake informed action with long-term recorded data\\nWith data loggers,\\xa0CO2 levels can be recorded over time\\xa0so that data can be viewed and analysed, and further action taken based on this evidence.\\nData from\\xa0CO2 monitoring\\xa0should be used to\\xa0assess whether ventilation measures are taking effect.\\nTime-stamped data from one room might show that instances of increasing natural ventilation-for example, by opening windows or doors-is effective at lowering CO2 levels. For a different room, with different dimensions and different available ventilation routes, analysis of data may reveal that there is a need to implement more significant measures to fully protect the health of occupants. Rooms which are shown to regularly record above 1500ppm should be identified and prioritised for improvements to ventilation.\\nA further advantage of monitoring with a\\xa0CO2 data logger\\xa0is that long-term recorded data can\\xa0provide evidence of the need for significant or structural changes to be made, helping to support funding applications.\\n\\nThe Tinytag CO2 data logger\\nRobust, easy-to-use and quick to deploy, the\\xa0Tinytag CO2 data logger\\xa0is a simple and effective solution for indoor air quality monitoring.\\nUsing\\xa0a self-calibrating non-dispersive infrared sensor (NDIR), the data logger accurately measures and records carbon dioxide concentrations with outstanding long-term stability. The\\xa0TGE-0010 model measures from 0 to 2000ppm\\xa0and is ideal for measuring indoor air quality in busy classrooms or offices. A model measuring\\xa0up to 5000ppm\\xa0is also available for more specialised applications.\\nThe data logger has an LED on its front which will\\xa0flash red when an alarm has been triggered, enabling responsive action to high CO2 levels. The data logger can be\\xa0wall-mounted\\xa0or placed on surfaces to continuously monitor CO2 concentrations wherever is required. Compact and light-weight, the logger can be situated anywhere where there is a mains supply, and can easily be transferred between different locations for versatile monitoring throughout a building.\\nData is offloaded and viewed in user-friendly\\xa0Tinytag Explorer software, where it can then be exported to third-party programmes in a variety of popular file formats (.xls, .xml, .csv, .txt) for further analysis and presentation.\\nGemini Data Loggers also offers a\\xa0certificated calibration service\\xa0that is traceable to National Standards. CO2 data loggers can be calibrated prior to shipment, or returned to Gemini at any time for calibration.\\n\\nWhile low levels of CO2 are a good indication of effective ventilation, they are not confirmation of low aerosol transmission by themselves. Other transmission factors, including occupant density, occupant duration and the type of activity being performed in a room should also be taken into account when assessing transmission rates. A good COVID-19 risk management strategy should also comprise mitigation efforts for other transmission routes, for example, mask-wearing, social distancing and reducing occupancy time in rooms.',\n"," 'A multi academy trust has revealed more than 1,500 education professionals gathered online last month to share best practice, setting the stage for a transformation in how CPD can be delivered in the education sector.\\nWellspring Academy Trust held its annual Festival of Learning virtually, showcasing the future of trust-wide interaction and shared learning. Whilst the shift was necessary due to Covid restrictions, the process has revealed how effective, engaging CPD can be delivered on a large, geographically diverse, trust-wide basis.\\nNatalie Hardman, chief administration officer, at Wellspring explains: “Our Festival of Learning is a highlight of our year, and a fantastic opportunity for our community of 25 schools to get together, be inspired and share their knowledge. There was no way we could let Covid stop that!\\n“Moving online proved hugely successful. We had 1,696 people all online together to watch the live stream of our keynote speaker and attendees booked 5,182 sessions in total. As well as colleagues from across the trust, we also welcomed colleagues from a further fifteen non-Wellspring schools.\\n“Sharing best practice across a trust that is spread across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and eight local authority areas can be a huge logistical challenge, but our virtual Festival of Learning has demonstrated quite convincingly how technology can overcome that challenge. One of the clear benefits of being part of a large trust is the vast amount of experience contained within it. By developing online opportunities for collaboration, we can really make the most of that.\\n“We are now exploring more options for online learning, including broadcasting of expert knowledge sessions for educational professionals across Wellspring and beyond. Professional generosity is an important part of our charitable purpose and we are committed to sharing our knowledge and expertise to benefit all. The opportunity for increased online sharing and CPD within MATs and the education sector as a whole is a really exciting prospect.”\\nWellspring’s Festival of Learning was held on 12 February and attendees benefited from workshops on a huge variety of subjects ranging from behaviour management approaches to how to best use the Google Education platform. A keynote speech was delivered to all by Jaz Ampaw-Farr before attendees than joined their chosen four sessions throughout the course of the day.\\nWellspring currently manages 25 schools, with that figure set to grow significantly over the next few years. It operates in mainstream primary and secondary, as well as having extensive experience in delivering special and alternative provision. Wellspring also manages a portfolio of complementary services, include mental health support services, community projects for young adults with special needs, and a host of training and consultancy services around behaviour management in schools.',\n"," 'How Oxford Business College reached out during lockdown\\nThe global pandemic has had a profound impact on the education sector. Lecturers, students and staff have all been deeply affected by lockdowns and social distancing rules. But one college prioritised reaching out during 2020. This is their story.\\nIn March 2020, like many educational institutions, Oxford Business College suspended face to face classes, and students were swiftly introduced to online tuition. Although originally expected to last only a few weeks, the College’s remote learning platforms have been developed to provide students with as much support as they’ve needed throughout the pandemic.\\nBy seeing online learning as an opportunity, not just a stop gap, the College has been able to accept new enrolments throughout the pandemic. Given many of the College’s students are from international backgrounds, they’ve seen an impressive uptake in spite of global travel restrictions.\\nOnline learning has also been welcomed by the College’s mature students. Leaders of the College conducted research on how mature students responded to the technology, and found that the majority were excited by the flexibility of remote learning. The College hope that this key finding will improve long term access to higher education for adult learners.\\nDuring the pandemic, Oxford Business College also invested in its content outreach in order to stay connected with students and staff via social media.\\nAlongside regular posts with insights and advice from the world of business, the College collaborated with companies across Oxfordshire on a series of video interviews. These interviews helped to promote local companies during a difficult time, while also providing valuable information for students on management and business development during challenging economic conditions.\\nContent has also addressed key social subjects, including diversity and inclusion, charity, sustainability and mental health. The College’s proactive approach to marketing saw it rank first on Edurank’s college social media tracker for 5 consecutive months, between July and November 2020.\\nMental health has been a priority for the College throughout the pandemic. As an ongoing part of its outreach programme, the College has been focused on supporting students. For example, the College recently hosted a virtual weekend of events which included comedy, music and cooking – bringing students together at a time when the academic community was working and studying apart.\\nThe College’s growth has been demonstrated through a significant rise in student numbers, and seen the opening of a second campus – a space in London to complement the institution’s main campus in Oxford.\\nIt’s been a year of development and expansion for Oxford Business College. Rather than seeing the pandemic as a roadblock, the College chose to take action to support existing students and reach out to prospective new ones.\\nThe College’s experiences are a reminder of the important words once spoken by Sir Winston Churchill, that, “A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty”.\\nDespite challenging conditions, Oxford Business College was optimistic throughout 2020, and is benefiting from new opportunities in 2021.',\n"," 'Pearson has announced the launch of a new Pearson Edexcel GCSE (9-1) English Language specification, which has been designed to engage and motivate students through contemporary texts and writing tasks, providing a new qualification choice to reflect the diversity of learners.\\nThe newly accredited Pearson Edexcel GCSE (9-1) English Language 2.0 qualification, which will be available for teaching at the start of the 2021-2022 academic year, provides students with a strong foundation for further academic or vocational pathways through real-world, applicable content.\\nBased on feedback from teachers, the new, one-year specification supports students following a less traditionally literary pathway through their English studies or educators looking for a fresh, new English Language course to motivate those required to re-sit.\\nWith an innovative approach to the 19th century text requirement that sees 19th-century, non-fiction newspaper articles and instructional pieces of writing used rather than 19th century fiction, the qualification uses texts with relatable, modern themes and focuses on real-world applicable writing tasks such as letters of application.\\nSpeaking about the new qualification, Katy Lewis, Head of English and Drama (pictured), said: “Every year 750,000 people take their English GCSE. In consulting with the English teaching community last year, we recognised that a one-size fits all approach to English Language doesn’t equally suit the needs, interests and progression of all learners.\\n“We wanted to develop a qualification that was equal but different to the English Language GCSEs that are currently available to learners across the UK, whilst motivating and engaging students to equip themselves with life-long skills.”\\nRequiring no co-teaching of literature, the functional qualification is designed to reinvigorate English language learning and pave the way for exam success whilst exposing learners to a broad range of diverse and inclusive texts.\\nAs part of the organisation’s work with the Lit in Colour programme, Penguin Random House UK will also be providing schools and settings taking the new specification with access to a bespoke anthology of texts by contemporary writers and writers of colour.\\nThe specification has been described as a “positive move” by teachers involved in its development, which allows students to truly engage and showcase their knowledge, providing them with “a better chance of success because the qualification meets their needs.”\\nRuth Rhoden-Farmer, GCSE and FS English Lecturer at Newcastle and Stafford Colleges Group, said: “The new GCSE format and resources will give each student the opportunity to explore visually engaging texts, engage with the English Language heritage, and apply the techniques they have discovered in their own writing.”\\nPearson will be providing schools and settings with specification and sample assessment materials, mapping documents, schemes of work and one-year planners, a comprehensive programme of online training and network events and one-to-one support from an English specialist to support them in delivering the qualification with confidence.\\nTo find out more about the new Pearson Edexcel GCSE (9-1) English Language 2.0 qualification, please visit quals.pearson.com/Lift',\n"," 'The Stephen Hawking Foundation has launched\\xa0a schools programme to enable children and their families to make informed decisions about vaccinations after routine childhood immunisations fell every year for almost a decade.\\nThe first in a series of teaching aids published today focusses on the COVID vaccine and tackles head on conspiracy theories that have led to limited uptake in some communities.

I fear that students’ real and fictional concerns increase UK vaccine hesitancy.\\n“The charged and often accusatory debate about vaccination choices can make young people feel hesitant about voicing their concerns and seeking help in debunking false information. They fear critical judgement over their doubts.\\xa0 I decided to create a set of unbiased resources for use in schools.”\\nThe partnership with the Stephen Hawking Foundation and LSHTM’s Vaccine Confidence Project has produced learning materials which can be downloaded for free from their and the Queen Mary University of London websites.\\nThe resources support the Stephen Hawking Foundation’s goal to encourage science education.\\xa0 It also builds on Professor Hawking’s family links with the research centre as Professor Hawking’s father was a researcher at LSHTM.\\nLucy Hawking, Chair of the Stephen Hawking Foundation’s Trustees, said: “We are so pleased by this collaboration, which aims to help young people gain a better understanding of immunisation programmes. We are dedicated to encouraging young people to engage with science. This important project aims to encourage school children to think about vaccine research and the progress in this field which is key to saving lives.”\\nProfessor Heidi Larson, Director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, said: “I feel teachers are ideally placed to combat the UK’s falling vaccination rates. This programme has been carefully calibrated to include the insights of some of the leading scientists in this field but to make the information accessible to people of all ages and communities.”\\nAn immunologist from Queen Mary University of London, doctors, primary school specialists, teachers and students from Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds and a prominent member of the Somali community have also fed in to the teaching materials.\\nThe resources are designed to promote critical thinking, ask big questions and provide reliable, well sourced information to help school age students investigate complex issues regarding science and society within a classroom setting. The vaccine project is the first of a projected series of such initiatives.\\nFor more information, please go to\\xa0Vaccines – The Stephen Hawking Foundation',\n"," 'Work is set to begin on the new Discovery Academy in Sheffield, designed by HLM Architects working with construction specialists Tilbury Douglas Construction.\\nThe free special academy will cater for 80 special education needs (SEN) pupils and is being delivered via the Department for Education Framework on behalf of Sheffield City Council.\\nThe site is located in the south east of the city centre, on the grounds of a former special school. The new two-storey facility will be a simple linear block, comprising primary and office accommodation on the ground floor, with secondary provision and further office accommodation at first floor. The hall and dining accommodation, which includes a ‘quiet’ dining area, will be shared by all years and is located close to associated service space and external breakout and sitting areas.\\nPrimary classrooms will be located on the ground floor to enable direct access to the dedicated outside social space. Internally, the primary school is separated from the secondary school through the use of a secure, pass door adjacent to the main entrance. At the heart of the school sits the library, hall and dining where primary, secondary and entrance routes converge.\\nDuring the design process, HLM Architects engaged with the school, academy sponsors, planning authority and local community through a series of structured workshops and held a public exhibition to integrate feedback before the submission of planning.\\nThe design of the school is based on sustainability principles. This has included optimising daylight and natural ventilation within teaching spaces to promote a passive, sustainable approach. The site is being developed to enhance its ecological value, retaining mature landscape features, and incorporating sustainable drainage measures such as porous macadam and rainwater attenuation. Wherever possible sustainable or recycled materials have been specified without affecting the schemes durability, such as recycled plastic benches. The school is expected to open in February 2022.\\nJohn Gittins, Divisional Director at Tilbury Douglas Construction, said: “We are delighted to be working with HLM Architects to deliver the new Discovery Academy project for the Department for Education. Tilbury Douglas’ appointment to this project is real testament to the expertise within our team and our excellent track record in delivering some of the best education facilities in the UK.”\\nNexus MAT Chief Executive Warren Carratt said: “We are beyond excited to be working with the DfE, Sheffield council, HLM and Tilbury Douglas to build or new special academy. We are passionate about bring greater choice and quality of offer to families in Sheffield, and Discovery Academy will make a huge difference to the local SEND landscape. We have been actively engaged with the design process throughout, and the school has been planned with needs of our specific learners in mind”.\\nAJ Taylor, Associate at HLM Architects, said: “The design of this school has been driven by the creation of a high-quality, personalised provision for pupils with autism-spectrum conditions with related social, emotional and mental health needs, as well as a range of other learning difficulties which will result in a safe and nurturing learning environment.”',\n"," 'The National Literacy Trust and the Premier League are working together to distribute nearly 25,000 books to five to 11-year-olds who need them most this World Book Day (Thursday 4 March).\\nPupils taking part in the Premier League Primary Stars education programme, delivered by professional football club community organisations across England and Wales, will each receive a free copy of Football School: 20 Fantastic Football Stories by authors Alex Bellos and Ben Lyttleton.\\nNational Literacy Trust research has found that children who own their own books are nearly three times more likely to enjoy reading. The partnership will help support children whose access to physical books has been made difficult due to school and public library closures during the national lockdown.\\nNick Perchard, Head of Community at the Premier League said: “Through the Premier League Primary Stars programme we now engage more than 18,000 schools in England and Wales, either through the in-school support provided by professional football clubs or via the free online educational resources.\\n“This World Book Day, we are extremely happy to be able to further aid children’s education by putting free books into the hands of five to 11-year-olds. This is another important way our long-standing partnership with the National Literacy Trust is supporting children with literacy and encouraging them to develop a love of reading.”\\nTo further support pupils on World Book Day, the National Literacy Trust will host a fun-filled Premier League Primary Stars Facebook Live event, with the authors of the Football School title being distributed, Alex Bellos and Ben Lyttleton. The one-hour event will include a quiz featuring a special round of questions set by players from the Premier League, the EFL and the Women’s Super League.\\nJim Sells, Sport and Literacy Programme Manager at the National Literacy Trust said: “We are proud partners of the World Book Day charity, which promotes reading for pleasure to improve all children’s life chances. We know that children who have books at home do better in school but there are so many children who still don’t have a book of their own. We are delighted to be able to distribute such an incredible number of books to schools across the country with our friends at the Premier League.\\n“I’m also very excited for the Facebook Live event with Kenzie Benali, Ben Lyttleton and Alex Bellos, three brilliantly energetic personalities who inspire children to get into reading through their love of football.”\\nTeachers, parents and guardians will also have the opportunity to read a free copy of Football School: Season 1 via the National Literacy Trust’s website wordsforlife.org.uk/premierleague after the event, thanks to publisher Walker

schools converting to academy status.\\nThe Romero Catholic Academy, made up of seven primary schools and one secondary school based across Coventry, has announced its latest staff survey results which demonstrate just how far it has come in four years.\\nThe Romero Catholic Academy launched its survey in 2016 and has since held them at the end of 2018 and 2020, asking employees about their understanding of the Academies strategy, how satisfied they are with management, staff and pay benefits, their role, teamwork, change, decision making, culture and values.\\nDespite the latest survey being held during the Covid-19 pandemic, it highlighted improvements across the board, including some significant positive changes.\\nThis includes staff believing that their work is valued by their line manager, with almost 92 per cent of employees agreeing or strongly agreeing with this compared with 83 per cent in 2016, and that their wellbeing is considered in the workplace, with almost 83 per cent agreeing or strongly agreeing compared with 68 per cent in 2016.\\nAlmost 90 per cent of staff surveyed also said they would recommend the Academy as a good place to work compared with 69 per cent in 2016.\\nPatrick Taggart, Director of Operations at the Academy, said: “Uniting eight separate schools to form a Multi-Academy Company comes with its challenges, but one thing we wanted to focus on from the start was staff satisfaction to help ensure we were an employer of choice.\\n“One thing we learnt early on was that the Academy’s vision, mission and aims were key in joining the schools together, so we ensured these were not just on posters and in marketing, but spoken about in performance management, covered at key events such as our annual staff conference and included in our strategic plan.\\n“Going from just 63 per cent of staff agreeing or strongly agreeing that they understand the Academy’s strategy in 2016 to almost 90 per cent at the end of 2020 is an achievement we should be proud of.\\n“Our management styles have also developed, and whereas everyone used to have their own individual styles, school leaders are now shaped by our vision, mission and aims.\\n“As part of this we have developed our performance management processes, adopting a culture of listening, praising and appreciating employees and giving staff the opportunity to provide feedback and be involved in decisions that will affect their job roles.\\n“Although teamwork was highlighted as a strength when we set up the Academy, this was when the schools still thought of themselves as separate entities, so the fact we have managed to improve these results further is testament to the joined-up approach we promote.\\n“Job satisfaction has also improved, and a key thing that has been a driving force behind this is how we have improved the working environment at each school, thanks to how we have handled our finances since becoming an Academy.\\n“We have invested hugely in technology with laptops now being replaced every three years, the installation of Promethean whiteboards in every classroom and each school receiving new LED lighting – all made possible by making savings through rationalising the supplier base and bringing services such as catering and IT in-house.\\n“A key part of setting up the Academy was gaining the trust of our staff, and it’s clear from our results that we have made huge progress, particularly in the last two years when we have seen some dramatic increases in employee satisfaction.\\n“This improved mindset within our 500 staff means we are able to deliver a better provision for our children, providing them with better life chances, which is what we strive for.”\\nPatrick added: “Our next steps will be improving communication with employees across all levels even further by implementing a new staff intranet site, as well as encouraging more staff innovation.\\n“But we want to also use these results to support other schools making that transition to Academy status or those who have already begun the process, sharing our knowledge of what we have learnt to support the education sector.”\\nSchools and academies looking for further

The three-month agreement valued at nearly £500k is currently being offered until the end of March, to support schools through lockdown.\\nGayle Gorman, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, said, “Schools and practitioners are working hard to develop and deliver remote learning across the country. It’s fantastic that practitioners in Scotland now have free access to ClickView’s educational videos to provide additional support for the work they are doing locally at this time. Complementing the National e-Learning offer, this further strengthens the overall national offer of support for remote learning.”\\nMichael Wilkinson, managing director of ClickView, said, “As lockdown continues, the majority of teachers are finding it increasingly hard to motivate their students. Today’s students’ preferred format of information consumption is video. Curriculum aligned video-based learning content brings together movement and noise to convey an efficient message and capture their attention.\\n“ClickView and the National e-Learning Partnership encourage all schools to take up this offer to help them through the current challenges of remote learning. This doesn’t just mean learning can continue outside of physical classrooms, but provides the opportunity to revitalise traditional education practices, putting transformative world-class resources at their fingertips, for meaningful experiences at all levels of learning.”\\nJohn Stuart, workstream lead officer at the West Partnership, said, “We are delighted that West OS is hosted on ClickView because it provides the ideal platform for learners and school staff in Scotland to access on demand, high quality educational content as part of the National e-Learning Offer.

But the UK education sector is now firmly in attackers’ cross hairs.\\nThe threat is so serious that the UK’s Department for Education and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) put out an alert to school leaders last autumn and the NCSC said it has been investigating an increased number of ransomware attacks affecting UK education establishments since August 2020. Even prior to the pandemic, almost a third of UK schools admitted suffering a malware or ransomware attack in 2019.\\nThis trend isn’t limited to the UK either. The Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency and the FBI have both warned about increased ransomware attacks targeting K-12 (primary and secondary) institutions in the US, too.\\nResearch by Emsisoft also shows that the education sector in the US disclosed 31 ransomware incidents in the third quarter of 2020 – up from eight incidents the previous quarter (although there is a caveat here that there is a historical year-on-year trend for ransomware attacks on schools to spike after the summer ahead of the academic year starting in autumn).\\nHow safe is your Microsoft Office 365 cloud?\\nThe growing use of cloud environments by schools and colleges to support home learning, particularly Microsoft Office 365 – Outlook, Teams, and OneDrive and applications such as Satchel One, is just one of the ways that attackers are able to find a way in and steal data or hold an organisation to ransom.\\nYet there is still an all too common misconception that because your data is in the cloud it can’t be affected by ransomware. That simply isn’t true.\\nFor example, a child browsing the web on their school tablet or laptop at home can easily be tricked into clicking on a malicious link by accident. If that device is connected and synced to OneDrive as part of the school’s Office 365 account, a ransomware file can be automatically uploaded to OneDrive and encrypt school’s files and data held in the Microsoft cloud.\\nI’ve also seen examples where SharePoint, Exchange and other data sources have been hit. And if network drives are mapped to document libraries in Office 365 using the ‘open with Explorer’ feature, the ransomware can also scan for and infect files on connected drives.\\nDespite these examples, many organisations still labour under the misapprehension that they don’t need to worry because the data hosted in their Office 365 cloud is protected by Microsoft. In our own survey, nearly 40% of respondents said they believed that Microsoft provides everything they need to protect their Office 365 environment.\\nYes, Microsoft does have some limited features to restore deleted files. But surely it doesn’t need to be said that recovering deleted files from the recycle bin in OneDrive isn’t a recommended backup strategy. Neither is email archiving, which doesn’t allow you to restore a complete mailbox and all of its contents to a single point in time.\\nIt may be buried in the terms and conditions, but even Microsoft recommends that organisations use a third-party solution to backup and protect their data.\\nCharlie Smith is a Consulting Solution Engineer, Data Protection at Barracuda Networks\\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors.

The new African Studies Centre, the first of its kind – equips teachers with the skills and knowledge to teach students about the history of Africa, doing away with a tradition of learning about this diverse continent through the lens of European Colonialism.\\nOn this new project students will help to uncover more about the life of Charlie Hutchison, the first black British volunteer in the Spanish Civil War. Charlie had a fascinating life which reflects many wider themes in British history and politics; these include the history of anti-fascist movements and working-class political radicalism in East London; racial identity in the 20th century; black involvement in the World Wars.\\nAll the sessions on the new project will be led by senior Oxford University professors and PhD students delivering lectures on topics related to the life of Charlie Hutchison but reflecting on its wider significance for modern Britain and its relationship with Africa.\\nWhat is known of Charlie? Charlie Hutchison was born in Oxfordshire 1918 and died in 1993. His father was from the Gold Coast (Ghana) in West Africa and his mother was an English woman. He was the fourth of five children of this marriage. In 1936, when he was 17 Charlie travelled to Spain to join the International Brigade (IB) which fought on the side of the Republic against General Franco’s Fascist Army. Shortly after he returned to England WWII broke out and he joined the British Army in 1940 and served until 1946.\\nUntil recently little has been known about Charlie apart from a small file held within the Comintern archives (communist international) in Moscow, as details of his time in Spain remained in the public domain.\\nThanks to research undertaken on the last project by NewVIc students and staff Carina and Alan in collaboration with the Marx Memorial Library in London, more has been found out about Hutchison. First a photo of him was discovered, and then contact was made with his family. NewVIc students were invited to a special event to discuss their findings and present to seventeen members of Charlie Hutchison’s family. Prior to this project he was known only as the only black British volunteer in the International Brigade that fought against Fascism in the Spanish Civil War 1936-1939.\\nThe innovative programme is set to commence in March 2021 and is designed for any students interested in modern history, politics, the history of their local area, or exploring racial identity. It will also enable students to develop their independent research and critical thinking skills, conduct archival research with Marx Memorial Library and provide an opportunity to prepare students for applying to Oxford or other Russell Group universities.\\nNoah Enahoro, former project participant and Honours and A Level student, said: “I was honoured to be part of this project, Charlie Hutchison’s story would not have been told if we had not carried out this research into him, and discovered all that he has done throughout his life. I am so glad that we were able to do this, I feel inspired in terms of how Charlie carried himself in what he did and achieved in times of stigma in Britain, he used his experiences of oppression to motivate himself to fight against that in the Spanish Civil War. His story is small yet it has a huge impact because it highlights that there were others fighting besides him whose stories have not been told. This story highlights that there were people of other races in big movements but not as represented to us when we study history in the national curriculum pre-university. I really enjoyed telling his story to his family and reminding them of how great he was and to share this with the wider public.”\\nAlan Kunna, Programme Team Manager and Teacher of History, added: “This is a fantastic and exciting project for students to get involved in on our super curricular programme. Much of what we consider to be black history in Britain – The history of the African diaspora in Britain and the Americas is undergoing a radical genesis. No longer are people content to study the black America as if it were the only black history. Today’s historians are looking into the experience of people in Great Britain and its Empire. What they are uncovering is a rich and diverse history that turns on its head old assumptions and beliefs. It also shows that much of the contemporary white, black and minority ethnic experience is rooted in the development and history of Empire and Post Imperial developments. Today we are celebrating the life of Charlie Hutchison and his siblings. He and they are no longer hidden from public history but take their place amongst those whose experience will deepen our understanding of the history of the people of these Islands and beyond. People of colour have been in the British Isles since the Romans, and they have played a part in shaping the nation from Cable Street, to Spain, to the Battlegrounds of WWII and beyond”.',\n"," 'On February 18, 2021,\\xa0NASA’s Perseverance Rover\\xa0is set to touch down on Mars and begin exploration of the Red Planet.

Its strategic vision for the next 10 years sets out how UK sport needs to change as a sector and an ecosystem, ensuring everyone has the opportunities they need, now and in the future.\\nMore than anything, Archery GB is determined to tackle the inequalities long seen in sport and physical activity, providing opportunities to people and communities that have traditionally been left behind and helping to remove all barriers to engagement across all sectors of society.\\nThis complements Sport England’s strategy to put sport and physical activity at the heart of the nation’s recovery, bringing a new and diverse sporting activity to schools and providing the practical means to introduce ‘soft’ archery for all young children.\\nSport truly can be for all\\nIt has long been recognised that the range of sports available for children at school may currently only appeal to a small percentage of pupils since not all children are gifted with the same sporting genes and talents as others, and sport can therefore become a competition for the fittest or the fastest that many do not want to or cannot join.\\nArchery is a non-traditional sport that is currently enjoyed by over 5,500 under 18s who already participate in the UK. It can be learnt relatively quickly and undertaken indoors or out. Its many physical and mental health benefits are evident and ready to be shared by the nationwide school community, all the while following naturally socially distanced guidelines.\\nAn Olympic sport with more to give\\nArchery is an established Olympic and Paralympic sport that is keen to extend its reach to the younger community by way of a simple, low cost, ‘soft’ Arrows kit available for use by primary teachers nationwide. Launched in partnership with Clickers Archery Ltd, the Archery GB Arrows Programme provides teachers with child-friendly equipment, lesson plans and ideas for activities and competitions. Archery GB is currently running a competition to win a first prize of a Three-bow Arrows Taster Pack with two Home Edition Arrows kits for the runners-up.\\nArchery is also part of the School Games funded by Sport England National Lottery and in the 2018/19 academic year (the latest for which data is available) 145 archery school competitions took place involving 8,902 inter school participants and 1,290 inter school archery teams. It is hoped that the current initiative will help extend access to archery widely across the UK primary school community.\\nBy providing this opportunity for many more children to experience archery in the school environment, this ready-made sporting activity can be activated quickly and easily and introduced to the classroom by primary teachers without any training. With the prospect of success at the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo later this year, the time and more importantly the fit is right for archery to take its place on the wider curriculum in UK primary schools.\\nTaking the initiative for schools\\nArchery is an inclusive sport that can be enjoyed by children of all ages including those with disabilities who would struggle to take part in an alternative form of exercise.\\nCommenting on the commitment of archery to develop and support a diverse participation base across all school communities, Neil Armitage, CEO at Archery GB said “We want to offer children a new participation sport that will benefit them physically and mentally as we address the issues left behind by the Coronavirus pandemic. For too long, people with the most to gain from being active have been the least able to take part.\\n“As a result of the huge disruption 2020 has caused, and the inequalities the pandemic has reinforced or even exacerbated – around both socio-economic status and ethnicity – our drive to do things differently and confront these inequalities head on is stronger than ever.\\n“This equipment will enable schools to initiate an activity for young children that will benefit their immediate well-being. We are also encouraging and training new instructors so those who engage with the sport at a young age can take a Beginner’s course and develop their passion further. Our goal is to give all children the opportunity to have a go at archery either via their primary school or at a local archery club.”\\nwww.archerygb.org/win-soft-archery-arrows-kits/',\n"," 'Jemma Sherwood has been appointed Senior Lead Practitioner for Mathematics at Ormiston Academies Trust, a brand-new role that will see her head up the team of regional lead practitioners and develop the Mathematics curriculum across the academies.\\nAn established figure in the education landscape and former Head of Mathematics, Jemma is a published author, and has been writing and reviewing content for education publishers for a number of years, including for TES and Teach Secondary.

The support that the school has had means that we are now in a position to drive forward our aim of providing all of our students with an outstanding education. Being part of a local multi-academy trust is important for us because all of the schools within it truly have a voice and this means the needs of our communities are fully understood and catered for. Thrybergh Academy is now part of a caring, ambitious family of schools and we look forward to what the future holds for our students, staff and local community.”\\nAcademising under the Trust means that both schools receive funding directly from the government rather than local authorities. Other benefits include more control over how things are done within the schools and access to more readily available support and advice to raise the standards of the schools.\\nFoljambe Primary School has already started improving the school facilities after joining WPT with plans to rebuild the campus starting at the end of February.\\nBeverley Tate-Brier, Headteacher at Foljambe Primary School added: “This is a very exciting time for the future of Foljambe. We have been working in partnership with Wickersley Partnership Trust for some time now and we are proud of the changes we have already made in moving the school forward. We cannot wait for the building work to take place to give our children and their families an environment that they deserve.”\\nSteve Calvert, Chair of Directors at Wickersley Partnership Trust added: “The Trust had long discussions about whether we should bring Thrybergh into our family of schools – lots of debates about financial risks and capacity.\\n“In the end the core question was ‘did we feel we could help the students become happier and have better life outcomes?’ and we believe the answer is yes. We are delighted to bring the schools on board and I’m sure the talented team and amazing students will ensure it’ll be a success story for years to come.”\\nHelen O’Brien, CEO at Wickersley Partnership Trust added: “At Wickersley Partnership Trust, we aspire to send all young people into an ever-changing world, able and qualified to play their full part in it.

This paper focuses on the gap in attainment likely caused by March 2020 school closures (commonly called ‘learning loss’), and the disadvantage gap for Year 2 children as measured in autumn 2020.\\nThe findings suggest that primary-age pupils have significantly lower achievement in both reading and maths as a likely result of missed learning. In addition, there is a large and concerning attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and non-disadvantaged pupils.\\nThis study is one of the first to provide robust insights into the extent of learning loss that might have occurred as a result of partial school closures. It is based on data collected by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) from assessments in reading and maths taken in November 2020 by more than 5,900 Year 2 (6 / 7 year olds) pupils in 168 representative primary schools. These were compared with tests taken by Year 2 pupils in autumn 2017, also from a representative sample of schools.\\nOverall performance in both reading and mathematics in autumn 2020 was found to be significantly lower compared to the 2017 cohort, with pupils, on average, making two months less progress in both subject areas compared to the standardisation sample. Worryingly, the study finds that “a very large number of pupils were unable to engage effectively with the tests”.\\nThe study also finds a large and concerning gap between the attainment of disadvantaged pupils and non-disadvantaged pupils. For both reading and maths this gap is estimated to be the equivalent of seven months’ learning. While both calculations indicate a large gap, the results, expressed in terms of months of learning, should be interpreted with caution.\\nThe 2017 NFER assessment data did not compare the performance of disadvantaged pupils with all other pupils. As a result, it is not known if the gap has grown compared to 2017.\\nThese interim findings are part of an ongoing EEF-funded study. Further analysis will be carried out in March 2021 and June 2021 to examine whether the gap narrows, widens or remains stable. In addition to these preliminary findings, NFER is preparing a short publication for teachers that will include more detailed commentary on pupils’ responses and suggestions that schools can act upon.\\nLast June, the EEF published a rapid evidence assessment, Best evidence on impact of school closures on the attainment gap, which found that school closures are likely to reverse progress made to close the gap in the last decade since 2011.\\nSir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust and chairman of the Education Endowment Foundation, said: “By the time schools reopen, children and young people will have faced almost a year of learning disruption. The repercussions of these months of lost learning are devastating and will be felt for a lifetime, especially by those from low-income backgrounds.\\n“Today’s findings give valuable insight into the challenges facing schools and teachers.\\xa0 Vast resources need to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils by raising the pupil premium significantly and providing funding for tuition.”\\nProfessor Becky Francis, CEO of the Education Endowment Foundation, said: “This new research offers compelling evidence of what we have feared since schools were closed to most pupils in the first national lockdown – that there will be a large negative impact on learning, with disadvantaged pupils suffering the most. Despite the inspiring and tireless work of schools across the country, this will only be compounded by the current partial school closures.\\n“It is vital, therefore, that we draw on the best available evidence in responding to this national crisis, supporting teachers and school leaders to get the right support to the pupils who have missed out most.\\n“But we should be under no illusions that there are quick fixes. Schools will need continued and significant support in the years ahead if we are to avoid a generation of pupils being left behind. This latest research highlights, yet again, the need, to make tackling educational inequality a national priority.”\\nDr Ben Styles, head of the National Foundation for Educational Research’s Education Trials Unit said: “There has been lots of speculation about the extent to which children may have fallen behind and it is valuable to report some attainment data on this question.\\n“Measuring gaps in test scores is not much use to teachers without more diagnostic information concerning where children have fallen behind and we hope to provide this imminently.”',\n"," 'Blackheath High School has been awarded the prestigious Eco-Schools Green Flag, recognising its commitment to excellence in environmental action and learning.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTo be awarded the\\xa0Green\\xa0Flag,\\xa0schools\\xa0must\\xa0lead initiatives and provide hands-on learning activities covering three of the\\xa0Eco-School’s\\xa0environmental\\xa0topics.\\xa0Blackheath High chose to tackle energy,\\xa0waste and biodiversity.\\xa0The girls learned about energy use,\\xa0ran energy-saving switch-off campaigns that have reduced the school’s CO2 emissions,\\xa0and carried out environment and energy audits.\\xa0They\\xa0also engaged with the local community, clearing litter and plastic waste from the street to help prevent it from reaching rivers and oceans.\\xa0To increase biodiversity around the school, the girls built a minibeast hotel, a stag beetle nursery and introduced wildlife-friendly planting.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThese\\xa0are just a handful of the\\xa0initiatives Blackheath High has introduced to empower its students to\\xa0have a positive impact on\\xa0the environment.\\xa0In celebration of its 140th\\xa0Anniversary\\xa0last year,\\xa0Blackheath High invited all members of the school community to make\\xa0environmentally-focused pledges to improve the local community and planet.\\xa0One of its pledges was to\\xa0be one of a handful of schools to\\xa0introduce the study of ocean plastics to the\\xa0curriculum.\\xa0Blackheath\\xa0High\\xa0partnered with\\xa0Common\\xa0Seas, an anti-plastic pollution not-for-profit,\\xa0to\\xa0deliver this.\\n\\n\\nCarol Chandler-Thompson, Head of Blackheath High\\xa0School said:\\xa0“At Blackheath High we are all\\xa0hyper-aware of the\\xa0environmental crisis, and I\\xa0am so proud of how committed\\xa0our\\xa0girls\\xa0and staff\\xa0have been\\xa0in playing their part to combat it.

This is definitely the case for Billingham South Community Primary School in Stockton-on-Tees, which has kick-started the new year with staff training with a twist: a unique training programme teaching staff how to clean ‘the NHS way.’\\nDelivered by Tony Sullivan (left), the Environmental and Decontamination Services Manager based at University Hospital of North Tees and board member for the professional body for decontamination, the Institute of Decontamination Sciences, the NHS Deep Cleaning and Advisory Service training programme teaches the wider community how to clean ‘the NHS way’.\\nFrom touchpoint cleaning and application of disinfectants to ATP swab tests and how to remove PPE correctly, the training session covers a wide range of topics that have helped the team at Billingham South adapt the school’s cleaning strategy in line with the NHS standard, therefore helping to reduce the risk of infection.\\nBy investing in the training programme from the NHS Deep Cleaning and Advisory Service, not only is the school enhancing its cleaning regime but it is also directly supporting the NHS. In addition to helping reduce the spread of infection in the local community and consequently easing pressure on local hospital Trusts, the income generated by the cleaning service is reinvested back into the NHS to support frontline patient care.\\nEdwin Squire, Headteacher at Billingham South, said: “Cleaning staff are very much at the forefront of this pandemic and it’s important they are equipped with the relevant knowledge, skills and equipment to help protect our staff, students and their loved ones at Billingham South.\\n“The training session delivered by the NHS Deep Cleaning and Advisory Service has been key to enhancing our cleaning regime at the school.

Some of the biggest issues facing the globe have been helped through the power of education. Here are just some of the ways in which education has played an important role in changing the world.\\nTackling world problems\\nIssues like Climate Change and the Covid-19 pandemic are global problems that need global solutions. Education has enabled countries to work together to reveal problems, and to develop ways to help. Education also helps citizens across the world to become part of the solution, educating us all on how we can contribute.\\nRevealing and solving inequality\\nSocial inequalities can be difficult to discern, but education allows the world to uncover and to prevent inequalities leading to disadvantaged societies and communities. For example, ongoing efforts to raise funds for schooling in Africa tackles poverty by giving African people the tools to learn, gain the skills for a career and to improve their quality of life.\\nDeveloping nations\\nAt the same time as helping individuals, education can also assist the development of entire countries. Particularly countries which have weaker or developing economies, education can help nations to establish the industries and expertise necessary to grow, which in turn helps those countries to reinvest in schooling and other vital public services such as healthcare.\\nBridging divides\\nThe sentiment goes that although we live on a diverse planet, there is more that unites than divides us. Education can make this statement true, by bringing communities together to learn collectively. There have been examples of this through history, particularly in the case of communities where there has previously been friction. Education can soothe those tensions, and foster better understanding.\\nFostering peace\\nIn fostering better understanding, education also fosters peace. Where there have been wars and tension, education can sideline conflict by focusing instead on the common issues that affect us all. By teaching people around the world about ways to develop, grow and improve, education can inhibit the potential for hostility and fighting.\\nHelping the world to grow\\nA phrase that you may have heard before is “give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime”. Education enables people across the planet to learn how to develop. This process of empowering our own educational development means that the whole world will grow, with new ideas, new inventions and new ways to improve lives.\\nAdding to his description of education as a “master key”, Khawaja also explains that education can eventually eradicate the need for locks entirely, opening up the world to a new sense of togetherness and openness.\\nEducation can change the world in many ways, from enriching communities through skills and income, to ushering in peace and society at a national level. Education has shown its capacity to change the world, and as the globe continues to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, it remains an important way to heal the world as well.',\n"," 'Plymouth College of Art are already renowned for their highly sought-after creative evening classes and Short Courses, covering a wide range of subjects from calligraphy to ceramics.

Apart from having their own health to worry about, they are also dealing with increased feelings of anxiety and disillusionment among pupils, as well as fears and frustrations from parents. They are carrying enormous amounts of responsibility, yet it seems that they haven’t received the necessary support to be able to deal with this mental and physical burden. Nobody was prepared to deal with what Covid did to our society, but where other sectors have had more leeway to get it wrong and try again, teachers are under constant pressure to handle and solve the situation correctly and immediately. They are just expected to get on with it and make it work, because if they don’t, it’s our children’s futures that are on the line. It personally really worries me that so many teachers suffer from mental health issues as a result. It is harrowing to hear how many ambitious, enthusiastic and capable people decide that the teaching profession is too stressful for them and quit. It puts even more strain on the ones that remain, it’s desperate on so many levels.”\\n“At Plymouth College of Art, we don’t have the solutions to all of this, but we do know about creating safe and creative spaces where people can learn together to tackle challenging societal, professional and personal issues. That is what this short course is all about: creating a space to catch our breath, take stock and using the arts and research to design and implement small changes that support our teaching in this uncertain world. I have designed the course in a way that allows for ‘relaxed’ sharing of experiences and playful approaches to exploring where we are and where we want to go. Experts will share their view and will provide theoretical pedagogical underpinning.”\\nThe course will also welcome guest speakers and educators to two of the sessions, one of which will be Dr Penny Hay, artist and educator, Reader in Creative Teaching and Learning, Senior Lecturer in Arts Education, Research Fellow, Centre for Cultural and Creative Industries; School of Education, Bath Spa University and Director of Research, House of Imagination (formerly 5x5x5=creativity).\\nThe course is open to teachers in both primary and secondary education, as well as headteachers and managers in education, NQTs, and support workers.

Furthermore, nearly two-thirds (64.4%) would have welcomed more support and guidance from central government – findings that have led to recommendations around the provision of national exemplars and guidance in responding to unprecedented events in the future.\\nDr Helen Curran, Senior Lecturer in Education: SEN at Bath Spa University, said:\\xa0“The global pandemic has exposed the existing crisis in SEND, and amplified challenges that SENCOs already faced, such as a lack of time to execute the role.\\n“We know that schools have worked tirelessly to support young people during the pandemic, facing daily challenges, difficult decisions and changing national guidance. As we get to grips with a third lockdown and return to remote learning, there is a real risk that children with SEND will continue to be disproportionally impacted by the pandemic, unless teachers, SENCOs and pupils are given additional support in areas like providing appropriate and differentiated virtual learning.”\\nAlthough the research highlighted a number of challenges as a result of the pandemic, there were some positive experiences of online learning reported for some children with SEND, including a reduction in social communication and interaction anxieties.\\nAdditionally, the majority of SENCOs (84.2%) reported an increased focus on communication with parents and families, and most SENCOs (71%) in academies were satisfied with the support from their Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs.)\\nProfessor Adam Boddison, Chief Executive at nasen commented: “The SENCO Workforce Survey not only shines a spotlight on the strengths and challenges that impact SENCOs in their work, it also exposes some of the hidden challenges that continue to perpetuate inequalities impacting children and young people with SEND and their families.\\n“The pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on children and young people’s social, emotional and mental health needs, exacerbating social interaction challenges. It is vital that we support them and the mental wellbeing of our education workforce. We would like to see routine wellbeing arrangements put in place following this extended period of national challenge, including priority support for SENCOs.\\n“Moving forward, it is important that we work collaboratively and share good practice across mainstream, special schools and specialist settings to help all children and young people, particularly those with SEND, to learn and thrive regardless of their background or need.”\\nThe full report, National SENCO Workforce Survey 2020: Supporting children and young people with special educational needs and their families during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, can be viewed here: https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/projects/senco-workload/\\nAs part of its commitment to ensuring expertise in SEND is available to every school and setting, nasen will be offering membership for free from January 25th.\\nTo find out more information about nasen and their upcoming free membership, visit: www.nasen.org.uk/membership.\\nAdditional COVID-19 information and resources can also be found at www.nasen.org.uk/covid-19.',\n"," 'Companies, organisations and schools wishing to submit entries to the annual Education Resources Awards now have until 5pm on Wednesday 31st March 2021 to register their entries.\\nAccording to organiser Chris Milton of Brilliant Media: “Having discussed the current lockdown status with both BESA, our partners and the education marketplace, we have taken the decision to push back the closing date of the Education Resources Awards 2021, in order to provide more time for all companies and schools to properly plan and submit their entries for consideration.

The 1920s Bede Building (pictured left) will see its old hall undergo a complete refurbishment, with the inclusion of a sophisticated, 360 degree immersive visualisation ‘dome’ created within it, that will allow students to train in a number of virtual reality environments.\\nThe dome, a fully integrated immersive solution, will create virtual realities for students studying in several technical disciplines. The major refurbishment will also include the creation of an amphitheatre-style seated area, and a number of innovation suites and flexible spaces for employer led training.\\nNorth East firm Malcolm Hollis has been appointed to oversee the major development and a construction partner Engie has been has been appointed to deliver the designs – which were developed by North East architect, Seymour Architecture. Work will commence in January and will be completed in October 2021.\\nEllen Thinnesen (pictured right), chief executive of Education Partnership North East, which includes Sunderland College, said: “I am absolutely thrilled that we have secured funding to develop what will become a leading technical skills and digital innovation centre. The centre will be game changer for our college and most importantly for young people and employers from across our region.\\n“Bede is a stunning campus, that has already benefitted from major capital investment over the last few years to ensure that, behind its beautiful red brick façade, we’re able to offer first-class educational experiences. . This latest investment will raise the bar yet again, and the plans we have for the new centre will position us right at the cutting-edge of education. The new centre will be a fantastic regional asset that will ensure our T Level provision is exceptional and we are able to increasingly deliver a valuable pipeline of students to meet regional skills shortages.”\\nThe new centre will allow the college to develop student’s knowledge, understanding and skills in a shared VR facility offering flexible applications for all T Level disciplines – for instance, health students might learn CPR in a simulated football stadium, where the sights, sounds and reality of an emergency response situation are recreated by digital 360 degree technology, a learning environment radically different to the confines of a traditional classroom. Similarly, T level students studying construction will be able to shape the way a health and safety worksite scenario unfolds in response to their decisions. And supported by the college’s technical team, employers will be able to recreate their manufacturing plants within the centre using 360 degree immersive technology for training of existing or future employees.\\nSunderland College will begin delivery of its new T Level provision from the new centre from September 2021. T Levels will offer a new and unique curriculum, which will include employer led education and technical training for students, within industries such as construction, digital, health, science and education.\\nAs well as exceptional facilities, the college will ensure its offer is anchored by close links to employers, and will shortly be announcing new strategic partnerships to support the development of the digital innovation centre as a vibrant business hub ensuring employers are at the heart of the next generation of talent.\\n“We want this facility to be a collaborative space, where businesses co-design and co-deliver education to ensure that we maximise the value of this space. We’ll be working with partners from a range of industries to simulate their working environments, and ensure every T Level student leaves us with unmatched theoretical knowledge, and authentically developed skills enabling through digital technologies, meaningful employer partnerships and industry placements”.\\n“We’re a future-focused college, and this new centre will absolutely exemplify that – it’s a place where education and business will converge.”\\nAs well as being an innovative centre for T Level training, the college will open a small sensory environment within the centre where T Level students will gain real work experience supporting the delivery of digitally informed immersive therapies for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).\\nEllen added: “This will be a truly life-changing space for children and young people with SEND, and we are determined that the centre will deliver maximum advantage to people from across the city of Sunderland and wider region.”',\n"," 'The Alliance for Learning Teaching School has been appointed to work with Star Academies to provide Mental Health First Aid training for staff across its 29 schools across the UK.\\nRunning from mid-January through to the end of March, the online training will deliver the sessions to over 100 personnel and will enable them to ensure the wellbeing of all pupils and colleagues, both remotely and in person.\\nLisa Fathers (pictured right), Director of Teaching School at The Alliance for Learning, comments: “As a teaching school, we are committed to supporting the wellbeing of schools – we were one of the founding members of Greater Manchester’s Mentally Healthy Schools programme.

The resources can be accessed in the classroom and at home, helping schools to support learning wherever it is taking place.\\nFrom April 2021 UK primary schools must deliver new teaching of relationships education, physical health and mental wellbeing. But, in a challenging year, many teachers have had little time to prepare. Discovery Education is responding to this by providing schools with open access to a complete RHE teaching and learning solution.\\n“We know that this is a difficult time for schools and that teachers might not be ready for the RHE curriculum changes”, said Howard Lewis, UK Managing Director of Discovery Education UK. “That’s why we’re providing free access to our popular Health and Relationships programme, which includes fully-resourced lessons and teacher support. We’re proud to help UK primary schools by opening up this exciting scheme of work.”\\nSam Winton, Deputy Headteacher at St Margaret’s CE Primary School in Crawley, is already using Discovery Education Health and Relationships. “Discovery Education Health and Relationships is our go-to resource for RHE”, explains Sam. “When we first reviewed the statutory guidance, we realised that it covered a lot of new ground. We wanted a complete scheme of work that teachers could pick up and run with. Health and Relationships has saved us huge amounts of time and is brilliant to teach. The resources and support have given us confidence to approach challenging topics and our pupils are very engaged.”\\nNewland House School in Twickenham is using Health and Relationships to teach PSHE remotely, as teacher Andrea Taylor explains: “Returning to school after the first lockdown early last autumn, we used the Health and Relationships programme to supplement our Recovery Curriculum. This was useful not only for children but for teachers as well, providing resources to help us explore and address any concerns or anxieties about the return to school. In periods of home learning the platform has also proved ideal. Integrating PSHE lessons into the remote timetable is very simple and the resources work equally well as both live online lessons and static resources, which the children can easily access from home.”\\nDiscovery Education Health and Relationships will be freely available to UK primary schools until 31st October 2021. Suitable for children in years 1 to 6, the programme will enable teachers to show that they are meeting the new DfE objectives and deliver lessons with confidence.\\nDevised by subject experts, the programme’s resources are engaging and age-appropriate. Child-led scenario-based videos feature children talking about key topics while role play activities help pupils explore scenarios and develop skills to confidently deal with issues that affect their lives today and as they grow.\\nDiscovery Education Health and Relationships covers 6 key topic areas: Healthy and Happy Friendships, Similarities and Differences, Caring and Responsibility, Families and Committed Relationships, Healthy Bodies, Healthy Minds and Coping with Change. Designed as a spiral curriculum, the programme enables pupils to revisit each topic as they progress through primary school, building upon their skills and understanding.\\nMany of the topics covered e.g. feelings of loneliness, isolation and loss and coping with change, have special relevance to the current pandemic and the challenges children face. The programme’s digital content means that teachers can easily pick up activities for children to complete at home to help them cope with the uncertainty of the situation and share positive thoughts and ideas with classmates.\\nSupport for teachers includes end-to-end curriculum planning, detailed guidance and help with parental communication. The programme also sets out a series of best practice principles to help schools create a safe learning environment for teaching about healthy relationships.\\nThe programme’s series editor is Lucy Marcovitch, a PSHE subject expert and former National Curriculum advisor. Lucy said: “The challenges of COVID-19 mean that many schools simply haven’t had time to get ready to teach a subject which needs to be planned very carefully and delivered safely. Discovery Education Health and Relationships takes care of this. Teachers can feel reassured that they are fully prepared while children can benefit from high-quality, inclusive resources to help them lead healthy and fulfilling lives.”\\nPrimary schools are encouraged to register for free access at www.discoveryeducation.co.uk/rse.

We don’t expect that our members will be able to offer the same level of free support this time around, so we are directing schools to three initiatives that will help them identify the products and services for remote learning that are recommended by their peers, so that they can put in place the measures they need as quickly as possible.”\\nFirstly, the LendED platform is an online tool offering teachers the opportunity to search, select and trial education technology resources for free, to determine their suitability before committing to purchase. As additional support, BESA have worked with their member companies to offer a wide range of additional resources that are specifically designed to support home learning. LendED has the full support of the Department for Education and was included in their list of recommended remote learning tools. All resources on the LendED platform have been provided by BESA members, trusted suppliers who have signed up to the BESA Code of Practice, so schools can be confident in their quality and service.\\nBESA has also released access to video recordings of the recent LearnED Online CPD event, which took place in November. LearnED brings together teachers from around the regions to share best practice and deliver peer to peer learning. The November edition focused on the challenges of delivering remote learning and featured case studies and panel discussions which highlight those schools and teachers who have managed the process well, and offers support for any educator looking for guidance. The videos can be accessed for free via LearnED.org.uk\\nIn August BESA published a report on Learning after Lockdown that featured school case studies on the products and services that they had found useful during the first lockdown, and signposted additional measures that schools might want to consider as they started the new academic year.

It’s important, therefore, that the people who use research tell the people who do research what kinds of questions they think those researchers should try to answer. That way, our research will be as meaningful and impactful as possible. We are working with teachers, parents of EAL learners, and EAL learners themselves to identify the most pressing questions in the field.’\\nA steering committee consisting of teachers, parents and EAL learners has been formed to oversee the priority-setting partnership (PSP). They have created a survey inviting teachers, parents and students to contribute their questions to the PSP. The team is keen to spread the word about the survey and the PSP so that organisers can hear as many voices as possible.\\nThe survey is open until the end of January 2021, at which point all the questions and comments will be analysed by researchers at Oxford University. They will look carefully at what everybody has said in the survey, create themes from the information gathered, and turn those into a list of questions that could be answer through research.\\nDr Chalmers said: ‘Themes that arise during priority setting will be turned into specific research questions for researchers to explore. For example, in the survey people might say things like “I want to know what the best way to teach vocabulary to my EAL learners is”, or “I find it difficult to remember new English words and I am not sure how best to solve this”, or “My son uses an iPhone app to learn English words – does this help him?”\\n‘All of these thoughts can be combined into a research question like “What approaches to teaching English vocabulary have been shown to be effective?”’\\nAfter the research questions have been created, they will be organised into a new ‘ranking survey’ that will ask participants to rank the research questions by importance. Finally, a workshop will be convened to allow participants to explore the ranked list of questions and decide together which of them should be in a ‘top ten’ of unanswered EAL research questions.\\nThe top ten will be published in magazines and journals, publicised at conferences and seminars, and sent to researchers in EAL and to people who fund their research so that new research in EAL can be informed by what matters to EAL research users.\\nSpeaking to teachers, parents and EAL learners, Professor Victoria Murphy, Deputy Director of the Department of Education at Oxford University, said: ‘Please let us know what you think, so we can get a good response to what research is maximally of interest to teachers, parents and EAL students. Public engagement in research in this way helps to ensure that the research we do is meaningful, relevant, and that it meets the stated needs of the people whose practice it is intended to benefit.’\\nLinks:\\n\\nMore information on the EAL priority-setting partnership can be found on the project website:\\xa0www.ealpsp.wordpress.com\\nA video explaining the project and how to take part can be viewed here:\\xa0https://youtu.be/rf-5KyY24Vg\\nShort animated clips can be viewed here:\\xa0https://ealpsp.wordpress.com/2020/12/15/social-media-quick-clips/\\nThe survey can be accessed directly here:\\xa0bit.ly/EAL_Survey\\n\\nThe project is funded by BAAL (the British Association of Applied Linguistics) and supported by the University of Oxford’s Department of Education.

It will use the restoration to inspire thousands of school children, with an initial pilot of its programme, From STEM to Stars, at schools across Northumberland and Sunderland in the WISE Academies Trust.\\nThe telescope will be at the centre of a project to create Kielder Observatory Star Groups – groups of school children who will study the restoration of the telescope to learn about the science and engineering skills involved while learning more about the night sky from the observatory’s team of professional astronomers.\\nThe team will be visiting schools for activities and children will also be visiting the site, which sits under the finest dark skies in Europe. Star group members will have the opportunity to become Kielder Observatory Ambassadors and have work placements at space companies in the North East.\\nCatherine Johns, CEO of Kielder Observatory, said: “Herschel is a familiar name in the North East. Both William and Caroline Herschel were hugely influential in the study of astronomy and to be able to restore a telescope that William Herschel himself perhaps used is very exciting. This project is part of our developing strategy to reach beyond the observatory site and connect with people in innovative ways to convey that special moment of Kielder inspiration.\\n“The project will enable children to work with expert businesspeople and academics in the North East, helping them make a direct link between STEM subjects at school and STEM career opportunities in the North East.”\\nZoe Carr, OBE, CEO of the WISE Academies Trust said: “We’re delighted to be the first schools to be involved in this exciting project. It’s important for our pupils to learn about their rich, scientific heritage and the great innovation that has been achieved here in the North-East. This project not only looks to the past but will also inspire pupils to see the possibilities that lay before them through the exploration of careers in engineering and STEM subjects.”\\nAnne Reece, chairwoman of the Reece Foundation said: “The Reece Foundation is delighted to support this project which brings the Kielder Observatory facilities to schools and children in the region – and links this to one story from the region’s rich history of innovation and scientific discovery.\\n“The opportunity to see the stars and planets alongside the chance to restore such a historically significant object as the Herschel telescope is one not to be missed. We are sure this will be both inspiring to the new generation of engineers and scientists that the region and the world so desperately need – and also a lot of fun.”\\nDr Angela Dyson, director of physics at Newcastle University, said: “We’re really excited to be part of this project. Alexander Herschel was the founding professor of physics at Newcastle in 1871. His father John, grandfather William and great aunt Caroline were all eminent astronomers. Restoring the telescope has been an ambition of ours for quite some time. This project provides a unique platform to inspire and enthuse the next generation of engineers, physicists and astronomers.”\\nThe new project comes as Kielder has recently received planning permission to site a new five metre diameter Spider 500 radio telescope, known as the Tanlaw telescope, which will allow it to contribute to worldwide scientific research, attract university research into Northumberland and develop its remote outreach activities, particularly in schools. The observatory has already announced the development of an augmented reality Kielder Observatory, allowing people to view a virtual nighttime sky, and is developing an online Kielder learning resource, with many more initiatives on the horizon.\\nThe observatory, which attracts around 20,000 visitors per year, has a team of astronomers, guest speakers and volunteers who discuss and make observations about the Universe through a series of public events.\\nLocated just a few miles from the Scottish border, high upon Black Fell, the site for Kielder Observatory was chosen as one of the locations in the UK which has the least amount of light pollution. It is one of just two observatories in England which are in protected dark sky areas, as certified by the International Dark Sky Association. The observatory started as part of Kielder Art and Architecture, a sustained programme of large-scale art installations around Kielder Water and Forest.\\nFor more information on events and to book tickets log onto https://kielderobservatory.org',\n"," 'The Institute of Physics (IOP) is calling on policy makers across the UK to level up student learning outcomes by backing a new subject-specific programme of support for teachers.\\nIn a report published today, the IOP is urging governments across the UK to commit to establishing an entitlement for teachers which ensures at least half of their professional learning is subject-specific. The report, Subjects Matter, says this change would raise student academic outcomes, and ultimately economic prosperity, through increases in UK workforce productivity.\\nGovernments can seize this opportunity, IOP recommends, by building a world-class system of subject-specific CPD to ensure that all teachers are able to improve their subject knowledge throughout their careers. Such a system would provide all students, in all schools, with access to high-quality subject teaching. This would increase the number of well-educated students and consequentially increase overall UK economic productivity, the IOP says. It would also reduce the current disparity of academic performance between UK regions, presenting government officials with a high-value opportunity to continue building on the ‘levelling up’ agenda. The additional investment would represent about 1% of the salary budget.\\nJonathan Flint CBE, IOP President and a former managing director at BAE Systems, commented on the pressing business case to invest in teachers: “Great teachers inspire the best outcomes in their students, whatever their subject. They are key to the UK’s future prosperity, and this proposal to raise teaching standards is an opportunity we must seize as soon as possible.\\n“Governments across the UK have a real chance here, to improve student outcomes over the long term while also tackling the economic emergency posed by the pandemic. By investing in the teaching workforce of today, we can better equip more students with the knowledge, understanding and abilities that will fuel the industries of tomorrow. Now is our opportunity to act, particularly given the UK already has a critical skills deficit, serious teacher recruitment and retention challenges, and ingrained inequality.\\n“This is the time to be investing in great teachers – giving them the tools and support they need to help students to realise their full potential. If the UK is to fulfil its ambition of becoming a research and innovation-driven knowledge-based economy by the end of decade, UK PLC will need to see this kind of investment in the teaching workforce in the next Comprehensive Spending Review.”\\nPointing to a wealth of evidence, the Subjects Matter report states that – in terms of improved attainment and progression rates – teaching quality has been shown to be the single most important school-related factor in determining student outcomes. It also has a larger influence than class size or teacher salaries. Unlike other professions such as doctors and lawyers, however, there is currently no UK-wide requirement for teachers to develop knowledge of their specialist subject through accredited CPD after they qualify at the start of their careers.\\nAccording to the 2018 Department for Education Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), fewer than 50% of teachers in England had participated in curriculum-related CPD in the twelve months prior to the survey, compared to almost 90% of teachers in Shanghai and 80% of teachers in Singapore.\\nIn addition, the survey found teachers in England engaged in less CPD overall than in most other high performing countries, and were less likely to engage in subject-specific CPD. Further DfE data shows that CPD expenditure varies hugely between schools and local authorities, with the highest expenditure-per-student in England being nearly ten times greater than the lowest.\\nEmily Perry, Professor of Education at Sheffield Institute of Education, Sheffield Hallam University welcomed the publication of the Subjects Matter report, saying: “There is a strong body of evidence which shows that many teachers lack access to high quality CPD. Therefore, I welcome this report from the Institute of Physics, which draws together the evidence to propose constructive, achievable ways in which the UK governments can improve the quality and provision of teacher CPD.\\n“It’s very helpful to see how teachers can be better supported to engage in subject specific CPD, through changes in the culture, provision and its quality. The IOP has provided recommendations that will result in all teachers gaining access to high quality support to improve their subject and pedagogical expertise, thereby increasing their retention in the profession and improving the educational outcomes of children and young people.”\\nhttps://www.iop.org/about/publications/subjects-matter',\n"," 'Scotland head coach Steve Clarke and penalty-save hero David Marshall have given their backing to a new initiative which will enable thousands of children across the country to add Scotland’s UEFA EURO 2020 adventure to their studies.

Whether it’s playing the game or being involved in the many jobs around football, Learning Through Football is a great initiative that will allow young people to learn all about the EUROS in anticipation of Scotland taking part and especially with Hampden Park being one of the host venues.”\\nDavid Marshall, Scotland goalkeeper: “It’s great to see that qualifying for a major tournament is already having a positive influence on young people through the school curriculum. Learning Through Football is a terrific initiative and one I wished was available in the classroom when I was that age.\\n“In a way it makes you realise the importance of what we have achieved and hopefully it inspires kids across the country to interact with football in a way that will help their education but also their careers with the possibilities that now exist in and around the game.”\\nBased on the established ‘inter-disciplinary learning’ model, the tool has been developed in conjunction with Glasgow’s Physical Education, Physical Activity and School Sport (PEPASS) team and Glasgow City Council Education Services.\\nMiller Primary School in Glasgow is one of the schools already using the tool in class, with pupils trying a range of new activities from designing football strips to making their own national anthem for the tournament. Two pupils have also re-enacted the Head Coach’s post-match interview after Scotland qualified in a dramatic penalty shootout against Serbia in Belgrade.\\nJacqueline Church, Principal Teacher at Miller Primary School: “We’ve thoroughly enjoyed bringing the Learning Through Football tool into the classroom. Everyone loves their football at Miller Primary and the activities are really flexible and allow the children to explore their own interests in the sports industry. Not only are the assignments fun and interesting, but the children are able apply a range of skills to meaningful life contexts, boosting their confidence and leadership skills.\\n“By exploring jobs within the industry, they are also recognising the teamwork, communication and perseverance skills we need to work in any job, which sets them in good stead for the future.”\\nDavid Weir, PE Lead Officer at PEPASS, said: “It’s been a pleasure working with the UEFA EURO 2020 Glasgow team and the Scottish FA over the past couple of years to develop this extremely valuable teaching and learning tool.\\n“The commitment to detail and desire to create an educational resource which not only acknowledges and references many aspects of Curriculum for Excellence but specifically delivers a relevant, coherent, challenging, enjoyable and lasting tool for all, was particularly appealing.\\n“We will all be celebrating when Scotland run onto the pitch for their first game at Hampden, none more so than our young people, and this tool will really help them feel part of it.”\\nThe tool is accessed through a newly launched area of the UEFA EURO 2020 website, which will give primary and secondary teachers easy access to the resources needed to deliver in schools.\\nThis new digital format of the inter-disciplinary learning tool allows teachers to see the cross-curricular links between project ideas, showing the wealth of learning areas that football can be part of. Alongside learning topics, there are a number of projects and assignments aligned to Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) learning outcomes in literacy, expressive arts, health and wellbeing, maths and numeracy, science, social studies and technologies.\\nEach curriculum area can be downloaded as a handy summary, as well as the whole snapshot of the curriculum and related project ideas.

Testing of 9,595 pupils in years 5 and 9 across 368 schools in England was carried out between February and June 2019 by leading learning company, Pearson.\\nThe report, which includes comparative data from 64 countries, places pupils in England behind those in the highest-performing group of countries, but significantly above the TIMSS average scores for mathematics and science. As in previous years, Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Russia all performed strongly across both subjects and year groups.\\nCo-author Dr Mary Richardson (UCL Institute of Education) said: “Our analysis of the data means we’ve been able to look not only at how pupils perform in mathematics and science, but to what extent gender, socioeconomic status, school and home environment impact on their educational performance.\\n“This year we see England has performed, on average, significantly above most other countries. Compared to the 2015 results, most notably, England’s performance in maths has significantly improved at year 5 and decreased significantly in science at year 9.\\n“Longitudinal data like this can help us understand these trends and we will now seek to interpret why these trends have occurred. For example, the study reveals that, unlike in 2015, year 5 boys’ average mathematics score was not significantly above year 5 girls’ scores.”\\nThe report also highlighted significant gender differences in attitudes towards maths and science. In both year groups and subjects, boys were significantly more confident, and liked learning more than girls. Boys also valued both subjects more in year 9 (which was the only year group asked about how much they valued the subjects). Significantly more girls than boys were not confident, and/or did not like, mathematics and science.\\nFor example, looking at year 5 pupils’ confidence in mathematics, significantly more boys said they were very confident compared to girls (39% compared to 24%).\\nCo-author, Dr Tina Isaacs (UCL Institute of Education) added: “The TIMSS data enables us to draw comparison between the attitudes of boys and girls in each subject in their respective year groups and to compare England’s gender differences with those of other countries.\\n“Despite social concerns about the differences between boys’ and girls’ performance, the results show that they’ve performed largely at the same level in both subjects and both year groups. However, girls still are less confident, and don’t much like, mathematics and science.\\n“There is already a plethora of research underway into why girls lack confidence in and enjoyment of mathematics and science, and the data may hold useful findings for researchers studying these and other behavioural issues.”\\nThe National Research Coordinator for TIMSS 2019, Dr. Grace Grima, (Director of Research at Pearson), said: “Pearson was delighted to be chosen by the Department for Education to deliver this important, international assessment in mathematics and science.\\n“This trends study provides policy makers with rich, internationally comparable data and information on student attainment and attitudes that will inform policies and support the teaching and learning of mathematics and science.\\n“Having pioneered the transition to eTIMSS in 2019 in England, we were pleased to successfully deliver these assessments using an innovative tablet-based platform in both primary and secondary schools.”\\nThe TIMSS study, run by the Evaluation of International Achievement (IEA) takes place every four years and England has participated in every cycle since its inception in 1995.',\n"," 'BT Sport and NewVIc have done it again producing a magazine style studio show, created by 12 NewVIc media production students on an eight-week film making course.

Today’s report, published by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER), examines the data collected by the International Early Learning and Child Well-being Study (IELS) as organised by OECD.\\nIELS showed that five-year-old children in England achieved similar development to their peers in Estonia – the highest-performing OECD country in the PISA study at age 15 – and greater development than children in the USA.\\nThe analysis shows us where there are development gaps, and identifies which groups of children may need additional support.\\nNFER was contracted by the Department for Education to analyse this data and report on their findings. The research examines early learning outcomes in emergent literacy, emergent numeracy, self-regulation, social-emotional development and physical development. These key aspects combine to present a holistic picture of young children’s development.\\nIELS involved children taking part in a range of interactive stories and games. Teachers and parents were also asked to assess children’s development in some aspects of social-emotional development.\\nKey findings from the report are outlined below:\\nLow birthweight was associated with lower physical and cognitive development, but not social and emotional development\\nChildren whose parents had reported them as having low birthweight had statistically significantly lower levels of emergent literacy, emergent numeracy, working memory and physical development at age 5 compared to their peers. The largest development gap was found in physical development – equivalent to approximately nine months, while these children were also three months’ behind in emergent literacy, and four months’ behind in emergent numeracy and working memory.\\nHowever, low birthweight was not significantly related to development in any of the social-emotional measures in IELS such as trust or emotion identification.\\nChildren’s physical development is significantly related to deprivation and gender\\nChildren who were eligible for free school meals were on average eight months’ behind their more affluent peers for physical development. Five-year-old girls were on average nine months’ ahead of boys.\\nChildren’s development across different outcomes at five-years-old is highly interrelated\\nFive-year-old children with greater development in early literacy (including listening comprehension, phonological awareness and vocabulary) are more likely to have similarly strong development in early numeracy. There were also strong correlations between high development in mental flexibility and working memory, while physical development was strongly correlated with prosocial behaviour and Trust.\\xa0 The fact that there were significant relationships between children’s development in different areas suggests that a whole range of different areas of learning are important for children’s development.\\nChildren with English as an additional language can be at risk in certain aspects of their development\\nChildren with English as an additional language were approximately eight months’ behind their peers for emergent literacy and three months’ behind their peers for emergent numeracy. In addition, they were approximately three months’ behind their peers in mental flexibility, working memory and emotion attribution. However, they showed similar development to their peers in inhibition, non-disruptive behaviour and physical development.\\nPersistence is associated with early development\\nChildren whose teachers rated them as ‘often or always’ persistent at the age of five were more than 12 months’ ahead of their peers rated as ‘rarely or never’ persistent for physical development. These children were also approximately 11 months’ ahead of their peers in emergent literacy, and 8 months’ ahead in emergent numeracy.\\nThere are a range of simple activities parents can do to aid their children’s development\\nThe research showed that children who drew or painted at home three or four times a week showed some evidence of better physical development than those that did not, equivalent to five months’ difference. Physical development covers gross motor skills, such as the ability to run and jump, as well as fine motor skills, such as using scissors to cut around a shape or putting on a coat without help. IELS also provides evidence of other simple activities parents can do to aid their children’s development at age 5, including reading to them every day, making sure they have access to children’s books at home, having regular conversations about their feelings, and being involved with their school.\\nCaroline Sharp, Research Director at NFER, said: “As we count the cost of the pandemic on children’s development and wellbeing, these findings feel particularly important. We know that too many pupils, particularly the most deprived, have been so adversely affected over the past year, and this research gives new insight into how we can best support those most at risk.\\n“In particular, this research demonstrates the impact that low birthweight can have on young children’s development across a number of measures. This new information shows that we must raise awareness of this issue, monitor the development of children with low birthweight for longer, and provide additional support for their development in these areas.”',\n"," 'Storybooks and tutoring could be important tools for improving young children’s maths skills, according to a new review.\\nIn a review of international evidence into teaching and learning Early Years and Key Stage 1 maths, published on 27th November, researchers make several recommendations for classroom-based interventions. They identified a small, but growing body of research which advocated teachers using storybooks to support mathematical talk and discussion with three-to-seven-year-olds. Tutoring programmes, especially for low-attaining children, were also found to have a positive impact on maths achievement. However, the review emphasized that this was only likely to be the case with planned interventions which were designed to address specific weakness in numeracy.\\nAlmost all the effective tutoring programmes had been developed by experts and were based on research into children’s mathematical development.\\nLoughborough’s\\xa0Dr Colin Foster, of the Mathematics Education Centre, said: “Improving children’s maths skills is an important aspect of education and anything which helps educators do this is vital for their development. Using storybooks could be a good way of helping children build more sophisticated mathematical ideas. However, we did find that teachers needed to carefully consider which storybooks to use and how to use them. There was a similar caveat for tutoring. The programmes we reviewed had an impact on learning and achievement. But successful interventions tended to be structured and designed around specific needs and involved regular sessions lasting a term or longer.”\\nThe review made\\xa0five key recommendations:\\n\\nDevelop practitioners’ understanding of how children learn mathematics\\nDedicate time for children to learn mathematics and integrate mathematics throughout the day\\nUse manipulatives and representations to develop understanding\\nEnsure that teaching builds on what children already know\\nUse high quality targeted support to help all children learn mathematics\\n\\nOther teaching aids highlighted in the review included computer-assisted instruction and explicit teaching.\\nResearchers found a large body of evidence demonstrating that interventions delivered through apps or computer-assisted instruction, or where guidance from teachers is high, can have a positive effect on children’s attainment in mathematics. However, much of the evidence relates to software that is not distributed in England or designed for the English mathematics curriculum.\\nProfessor Jeremy Hodgen, of the UCL Institute of Education, added: “Raising young children’s attainment in maths is vitally important and particularly so during the current pandemic. Our review, and the guidance it informed, provides valuable evidence for teachers and other educators about effective ways of improving young children’s understanding of mathematics.”\\nThe review,\\xa0Early Years and Key Stage 1 Mathematics Teaching: Evidence Review, was published by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and written by a team from the UCL Institute of Education (IOE), the University of Brighton, Loughborough University and Ulster University. It was written by Professor Jeremy Hodgen (IOE), Dr Nancy Barclay (University of Brighton), Dr Colin Foster (Loughborough University), Professor Camilla Gilmore (Loughborough University), Dr Rachel Marks (University of Brighton) and Dr Victoria Simms (Ulster University).',\n"," 'A team of Teaching Assistants at River Beach Primary School in Littlehampton has stepped in to help local families who faced food poverty over the school holidays.

It analysed data from the 2018 Teaching and Learning International Study (TALIS) and included survey answers from 9,405 teachers in five predominantly English-speaking education systems from England, Australia, Alberta-Canada, New Zealand and the United States.\\nThe study highlights that teachers across England work some of the longest hours in Europe and recent research by the UCL Institute of Education found that a quarter of teachers work more than 59 hours a week.\\nLead author, Professor John Jerrim (UCL Institute of Education) said:“ Our study shows that is it not just as case of saying extra hours lead to extra stress among teachers, but what they are doing in those hours.\\n“We found that for every extra hour teachers spend on marking and planning there is a significant association with decline in wellbeing at work. This is most likely because these are often tasks done at the evening, weekend and during school holidays.\\n“We also found that other aspects of the job such as extra time spent teaching or working with colleagues and undertaking professional development appear to have little direct effect upon the quality of working life.”\\nThe study also found the relationship between teachers’ working hours and their wellbeing may not be linear. For example, if teachers worked 35 hours a week, adding an extra hour or two may not lead to serious consequences.\\n“However, for those working 60 hours a week, an additional hour or two of work could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” explained Professor Jerrim.\\nAdditionally, the paper also highlighted the inequality in hours worked and levels of wellbeing experienced by full-time teachers. The findings suggested that full-time primary teachers in England who work 40 hours per week could increase this to 45 or even 50 hours with little effect upon their workload stress and wellbeing. At the same time, a reduction of five or ten hours amongst those teachers who currently work 60 or more hours per week might potentially lead to an appreciable increase in this group’s quality of life.\\nCo-author, Dr Sam Sims (UCL Institute of Education) added: “Our findings have important implications for education policy. There are two clear areas where reducing teachers’ workloads would help reduce stress: lesson preparation and marking.\\nWith respect to the former, perhaps the easiest thing that policymakers can do is dramatically reduce examination, curriculum and inspection reforms – all of which create new work for teachers, who are forced to change lessons, materials and teaching styles as a result.”\\nJ Jerrim, S Sims “Teacher workload and well-being.

More than half (54%) of young people the DofE surveyed worry their levels of stress, anxiety or mental health issues could increase if they are no longer able to continue with the activities and experiences helping them cope with the pandemic.\\nDuring the pandemic, extracurricular learning has been a lifeline for many young people, helping to maintain and boost resilience and mental health. 43% of DofE participants surveyed said they felt volunteering, doing exercise or learning a new skill has given them a positive focus during COVID-19, while nearly two thirds (64%) are more appreciative of non-academic activities as a result of the pandemic.\\nYet as problems with\\xa0sleep, depression and self-harm in children rise\\xa0and\\xa0youth unemployment is set to triple, access to these life-changing activities is under threat. Even when lockdowns are not in place, many youth clubs and classes remain closed and young people themselves are feeling pressure to give up activities. The DofE’s survey uncovered that 71% of participants that responded have had to cut back on extracurricular activities due to academic pressures caused by COVID-19. Nearly a quarter (22.5%) worry they might have to sacrifice extracurricular activities because they are more concerned about their parents’ financial situation.\\nIn response, The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award has launched its\\xa0Resilience Fund\\xa0to ensure thousands of young people facing disadvantage are able to participate in DofE, which has been shown to help increase wellbeing, confidence and resilience. Thanks to a very generous donation the Fund will\\xa0provide 12,000 funded DofE places for young people facing disadvantage, and train thousands of DofE Leaders, Managers and volunteers to further strengthen the charity’s support for young people from under-privileged backgrounds.\\nWhile the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have taken steps to recognise the value of extracurricular learning, funding services and positive activities for young people before and throughout the pandemic, young people in England have faced years of brutal cuts that have eroded their infrastructure of support.\\nToday the DofE is calling\\xa0on the UK Government to act urgently to prevent a wider mental health crisis, by ensuring the quality provision of extracurricular learning in England is prioritised, adequately funded and enabled, in line with safety guidelines, in Government COVID-19 guidance.\\nThis includes:\\n\\nProviding emergency funding for youth organisations so they can continue providing essential support and extracurricular learning, including releasing the £500m investment in youth services promised as part of the UK Government’s 2019 manifesto.\\nInvesting in\\xa0developing a\\xa0diverse, high quality and\\xa0sustainable\\xa0youth offer, particularly in areas of deprivation, to ensure all young people can access opportunities, activities and experiences that are essential to their development and wellbeing.\\n\\nHarry, who is doing his Gold DofE in Wigton, Cumbria, shares why extracurricular learning is so important to him: “When lockdown started, I was scared to leave my house and struggled to find anything good in life. I have autism and a rare genetic condition which heightened my anxieties. For my DofE volunteering, I grew vegetables in my allotment to share with local people who were shielding. Doing this helped me feel less anxious, more confident, and speaking to other allotment holders from a distance has helped me learn to socialise safely.\\xa0Being outdoors helps me relax and stay calm.”\\nRuth Marvel, CEO of the DofE, said: “These threats to extracurricular learning could have devastating impacts on the mental health and future prospects of young people\\xa0–\\xa0especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, many of whom have been hit hardest by COVID-19. Non-academic education is just as important as academic learning, and the UK Government must prioritise it as such. To face the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, young people need and deserve the increased resilience, confidence and independence built through extracurricular learning.”\\nA\\xa0new report,\\xa0also published today by the DofE, produced with the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER), highlights the long-lasting impact DofE programmes have on young people’s wellbeing and mental health, as well as building valuable skills for their future and prospects of employment. It reports that 62% of participants say doing their DofE made them more confident in overcoming difficult situations, 61% feel they have become more independent, 67% say it helped them feel more responsible, and 70% said it made them feel proud of what they can achieve.\\nThroughout the pandemic, the DofE has been supporting tens of thousands of young people across the UK to continue their extracurricular learning through\\xa0DofE With A Difference, providing physical, skills-based and volunteering opportunities that can be easily done from home.',\n"," 'Every part of society has been impacted by Covid-19, but its longest lasting effects may well be on the young, with those due to sit GCSEs and A levels, or equivalent, this summer amongst those most affected.\\nAs well as facing almost a year of disruption to their studies as a consequence of the initial closure of schools and more recently whole year groups being placed into isolation, they also face continuing uncertainty around the forthcoming A-level cycle.\\nIn order to support sixth-form students due to sit their exams in the UK next summer and help ensure they are not disadvantaged compared with those who sat their exams before Covid as well as future cohorts, the University of Birmingham has announced that it will be introducing additional flexibility around its admissions approach this year.

This message will be highlighted in the three quarters of schools in England expected to celebrate Anti-Bullying Week this year – reaching over 7 million children and drawing on teaching resources made possible with support from SafeToNet.\\nOdd Socks Day for Anti-Bullying Week took place on the Monday 16th Nov, when CBeebies and CBBC star Andy Day and his band Andy and the Odd Socks launched their new charity single ‘The Kids Are United’.\\nThe song’s video, made by hundreds of pupils in their ‘bubbles’ in schools across the country, encourages young and old alike to wear odd socks to school or work and celebrate what makes us all unique. The video features 11-year-old dance sensation, Princess K, sharing fresh dance moves in support of Anti-Bullying Week, as well as Libera boys choir, a hugely popular and internationally renowned choir from South London. Andy and the band will be sharing their song and discussing bullying in an online assembly to schools across the country on the morning of Odd Socks Day, which also features messages of support from Mo Farah, McFly and Anne-Marie.\\nFind out more about Anti-Bullying Week at www.anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/anti-bullying-week and get involved on social media via @ABAonline #AntiBullyingWeek #UnitedAgainstBullying #OddSocksDay',\n"," 'An education project which aims to bring the science of Martian exploration into the classroom is preparing for launch during National Astronomy Week (14-22 November).\\nThe project, called Roving with Rosalind, is aimed at children aged between 7 and 14 in disadvantaged and rural areas across the UK, who often have limited opportunities to participate in science outreach activities. The project is also setting out to help teachers train to deliver more effective science education.\\nSchools can sign up to borrow one of five kits packed with practical science experiments and take part in a suite of online activities, each linked to national science curricula. The activities are accompanied by video introductions from real space scientists, showcasing the diversity of talent working in the field.\\nEach activity provides insight into a different aspect of the science experiments that will be undertaken by the robotic Rosalind Franklin rover when it touches down on Mars in 2023. The rover is a key part of the joint European/Russian ExoMars mission, set to launch in 2022, which will search for traces of life on the red planet.\\nAt an online event on Thursday 19 November, organised as part of the Mars-focused National Astronomy Week, teachers and pupils can find out more about how Roving with Rosalind aims to recreate the experience of being a rover mission scientist.\\nEach kit contains a large map of the Oxia Planum area of Mars, where the Rosalind Franklin rover will land. Pupils will be able to explore the map using LEGO rovers they design and build for themselves, planning routes to points of interest where they will complete tasks to unlock ‘downloads’ of data from Mars to analyse. Those experiments will include elements of spectroscopy, physics, maths, engineering, programming and a range of other skills connected to the ExoMars mission.\\nRoving with Rosalind is organised by Áine O’Brien and Sara Motaghian, two Scottish planetary science PhD students. They designed the project to inspire young people from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in space-related science. The project is supported by £30,000 in funding from the UK Space Agency’s Aurora Science Education and Outreach scheme.\\nÁine O’Brien (pictured above) is working towards a PhD at the University of Glasgow’s School of Geographical and Earth Science. She said: “I was a physics teacher for several years before I decided to go back to academia, and I’m passionate about finding new ways to spark young people’s interest in science.\\n“We’ve designed the project specifically to reach pupils who don’t live within easy reach of a science centre or university. Research has shown that children who don’t have access to science outreach can feel that science isn’t a realistic career option for them\\n“The message of Roving with Rosalind is that science is an accessible career for anyone. The rover itself is named after Rosalind Franklin, who made huge contributions to the discovery of DNA but only recently started getting the credit she deserves.\\n“We’ve recorded videos with real space scientists from all walks of life to accompany the activities in our kits. We hope that their stories of how they ended up in their careers will be just as inspiring as the science experiments, and encourage kids to explore a future in science.”\\nRoving with Rosalind was originally set to roll out across the country in the spring, before the spread of the coronavirus pandemic closed schools and spurred a rethink of plans. Many of their resources and activities can be carried out without the physical kits themselves on the project’s learning page at https://www.stem.org.uk/user/login?destination=node/484445\\nUniversity of Glasgow graduate Sara Motaghian (pictured right) is studying for a PhD with the Natural History Museum. She added: “Although we’ll now need to quarantine each physical kit between sessions in schools, we’ve made up for any potentially lost opportunities by developing online versions of the activities in each kit. We’ve added new activities, too, like the opportunity for kids to control a virtual rover using the scratch programming language.\\n“It’s really important to us that teachers benefit from getting involved with Roving with Rosalind, too, and get the chance to brush up on new skills. We’ve been able to reach some of them directly over the summer and we’ve developed online training alongside the new resources for them to use in the classroom.\\n“We really hope that pupils and teachers alike choose to get involved with Roving with Rosalind, and we’re excited to start sending out the kits to schools across the UK.”\\nTo register for the Roving with Rosalind event during National Astronomy Week, visit https://astronomyweek.org.uk/mars-events/daytime-event-robots-on-mars The event will take place on Thursday 19 November between 11am and 12pm.\\nTeachers, technicians and STEM ambassadors can register interest in hosting a kit at https://tinyurl.com/y5bh5rh6 Parents and guardians can also register an interest on behalf of their child’s school using the same link.',\n"," 'UTC Reading Year 12 student Oliver Hitchings has been nominated for The Inspiration Award, for making hundreds of protective masks for the NHS.\\nOliver has been using 3D printers at home to make key PPE for local key workers during the pandemic and has used the skills he has learnt in class to make more than 150 masks.\\nHe said: “I got the inspiration from reading about people in Italy using their printers to make similar equipment in the midst of their outbreak – I thought it was a great idea and decided to do the same.”\\nOliver used PVC to create the front shield and elastic to secure the masks, using the help of his mum when needed.\\nHe added: “It’s difficult to get the printers running, but once you’re in the rhythm it’s not hard anymore, but it is time-consuming to deal with all the fiddly bits.”\\nHe started making the masks on his own, but now supports the demand with two other Twyford residents – Oliver Beardsall and David Dawkins – and in July, he estimated that they had created more than 200 between them.\\nOliver\\xa0has managed to supply all the local GPs, pharmacists, hospices, care homes and chemists with masks, and is now shipping them as far as Birmingham.',\n"," 'Children from Oldham-based Roundthorn Primary Academy and the wider community have supported local florist Eden in their shop window efforts to support The Royal British Legion in time for this year’s Remembrance Day celebrations.\\nPupils who attend the school’s lunchtime wellbeing club, an initiative set up by Pastoral Lead Miss Mallalieu, have contributed colourful drawn poppies for the shop’s display window to help spread the important message of Remembrance day whilst the shop remains closed amidst the coronavirus second lockdown.\\nThe school’s wellbeing club is set up to children of all ages and in an effort to get children talking to one another and to promote mental wellbeing, activities ran is the session range from yoga, cognitive learning sessions to reading and writing.\\nEden is a florist local to the school based in the village of Uppermill, established by business partners Vicky Newby and Jodie Bhondoo , and is continuing to operation by providing customers with deliveries in response to the last restrictions announced by the Government.\\nMiss Mallalieu commented: “Teaching the children about British history and Remembrance Day is really important so we thought this was the perfect way for the children to still embrace this yearly event despite the restrictions in place because of the pandemic.\\n“Not only this, but we also think it is really important to stay connected with the community during these challenging times, so having this display up means we can remain present to everyone without necessarily being able to meet and see people as we usually would.”\\nVicky from Eden commented: “We aim to support The British Legion every year and although we can’t welcome customers into store, we still thought it was essential to promote Remembrance Day like any other year.\\n“We are really pleased the children have got involved and their contribution has put a smile on our faces, and we hope it will do the same to those who walk through the village.”',\n"," 'Ecclesiastical Insurance is giving £120,000 to good causes as part of its annual 12 days of giving Christmas campaign.\\nThe specialist insurer will be giving 120 different charities an early Christmas gift of a £1,000 donation, with 10 winners announced each weekday from 7 to 22 December.\\nEcclesiastical is inviting people to nominate a registered charity close to their hearts to benefit from this festive financial boost.\\nIt’s quick and easy to nominate a charity online.

In addition, Laura Whitmore lends her support to the charity’s schools fundraising appeal by asking secondary school pupils and teachers across the nation to ‘Come As You Are’ – by wearing what they feel makes them comfortable in aid of the charity. Schools are invited to download a fundraising pack from bbc.co.uk/Pudsey. Primary Schools who download a fundraising pack will enter a draw to win a special online workout with Joe Wicks.\\nThe focus of this year’s primary schools campaign, ‘Five to Thrive’, is on supporting children’s mental wellbeing and resilience. Recent research commissioned by BBC Children in Need shows that the last six months have had a real impact on children and young people’s wellbeing. The nationwide survey of 831 parents and 697 children and young people respectively revealed that 94% of children and young people have had cause to feel worried, sad or anxious in the last six months, since the UK went into lockdown. Six months after lockdown, nearly half (45%) of parents feel that their child displays more feelings of worry or anxiety than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded.\\nThe ‘Five to Thrive’ campaign is based on the 5 Ways to Wellbeing and will have five key themes: Connect, Take Notice, Get Active, Be Curious, and Give. In the run up to BBC Children in Need on 13 November, primary schools will be provided with video content from Joe Wicks and friends including Dr Radha Modgil every day of the Appeal week (beginning Monday 9 November), with a day dedicated to each of the Five to Thrive themes. The content will help children to learn new skills such as journaling and improve their mood through movement. Resources created to support learning and to offer daily activities will also be available from BBC Children in Need’s Official Education Partner, Twinkl. These free materials will be available for every primary school in the UK.\\nThe primary schools campaign will also see the return of Joe’s extremely popular ‘PE with Joe’ especially for BBC Children in Need on the morning of the Appeal day, Friday 13 November, which will also mark an opportunity for primary schools to fundraise with a non-uniform day.\\nThe secondary schools campaign, supported by Laura Whitmore, invites schools to host a ‘Come As Yourself Day’: a non-uniform day which will give pupils the opportunity to wear what makes them feel most confident. The campaign aims to help pupils recognise the qualities that make each of them special and unique and embrace each other’s differences whilst raising money for BBC Children in Need.\\nLast year’s campaign, led by Joe, is estimated to have reached 3m children in 17,000 schools throughout the UK. Speaking of the campaign, Joe Wicks said: “It’s brilliant to have the opportunity to make a difference to children and young people right across the UK who are feeling the effects of a challenging time over the last six months. I hope to see all of the schools across the nation get involved and help raise money so BBC Children in Need can continue to fund projects in communities all over the UK; many of these projects are likely just down the road from you, that continue to be a lifeline to children in need of support.

The programme aims to allow targeted interventions to be developed so that students have greater chance to thrive at secondary school and beyond.\\nThe timing of this programme is of further relevance given the increased risk to young people’s mental health posed by the current Covid19 pandemic, emphasising the need for alternative, creative programmes such as this to support young people both during and post this challenging period.\\nBeginning early in 2021, more than 230 students from the BET family of seven schools, plus Steyning Grammar School (soon to join BET) will be involved in a series of visits to ACCF’s incredible grounds, to take part in activities including: cricket coaching, bushcraft courses, health based activities, and visits to Arundel Castle and its gardens.\\nThe activities will allow students to develop skills in resilience and self-confidence, which school staff will translate back into the classroom. Evaluation of the results will be completed by ImpactEd, a professional research organisation, so that all schools within and beyond BET can learn how best to ensure every child has an equal chance in school.\\nThe new project will support BET’s ongoing work into the benefits of outdoor education and will ensure that curriculum policies are informed by the best possible research.\\nNeil Strowger, Trust Leader at BET said, “Outdoor activities and education can be life-changing experiences for many children. Some with very little confidence have gone on to be head boys and girls; others with little self-belief or who may have disengaged with school entirely have achieved excellent exam results and reached positive destinations.\\n“At BET, we welcome opportunities for collaboration and game-changing research. This programme breaks new ground by informing and giving us the chance to ensure that connections between student profiles and different types of outdoor activity intervention can be properly considered.”\\nTim Shutt, Director of the Arundel Castle Cricket Foundation said: “Our education-rich surrounds here at Arundel are ideally suited to providing life-changing learning experiences to young people who may be facing some form of disadvantage or simply struggling with school. The need for interventions such as this, as we sit within a global pandemic, is as great as it has ever been.\\n“We are delighted to be forming this educational partnership with Bohunt Education Trust.

In the sessions, teachers will receive training to teach medieval African kingdoms and explore a wide range of topic areas, for all key stages of students.\\nThe online sessions will be a collaborative space where teachers from across the UK can exchange ideas and resources for teaching African history in secondary schools and sixth forms. The sessions are designed to broaden the parameters of the curriculum and students’ sense of British history, re-examining prevailing assumptions about national identity and belonging.\\nA principal goal will be to widen the scope of Black history that students are exposed to.\\nTraditionally, British schools have only taught African history through the perspective of European colonisation. The issue with such a narrow segment implies that Africa was ahistorical prior to European discovery, propagating a false perception that no noteworthy events, discoveries or civilisations occurred there.\\nThe African Studies Centre hopes to challenge this narrative of Africa by exploring its history that predates Colonialism and explore how African civilisations recorded and told their own histories.\\nThe idea of opening an African Studies Centre at the College was conceived by Carina Ancell and Alan Kunna, two history lecturers at NewVIc.\\nThe pair identified the need for a specialist place whilst undertaking research for a book they are co-writing on Charlie Hutchinson, the only known Black British volunteer in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War.\\nCarina Ancell, History Lecturer and Honours Programme Manager at Newham Sixth Form College, said: “As far as we are aware there are not currently any schools or colleges in London offering a comprehensive super curricular African Studies programme. As such, this is a real opportunity to develop expertise amongst the capital’s teaching community whilst developing students’ interest in and appreciation of African history.”\\nPrior to choosing GCSE options, the National Curriculum dictates that in Key Stage 3, pupils should be taught a syllabus which enables them to “know and understand the history of these islands as a coherent, chronological narrative […] how people’s lives have shaped this nation and how Britain has influenced and been influenced by the wider world”.\\nIn 2019, the Runnymede Trust found that despite the guidelines of the National Curriculum, there is considerable variability in how schools deliver lessons on British imperialism and post-colonial migration.\\nIn addition to this, academies are not legally required to follow the National Curriculum, making it hard to determine how these topics are being explored with students.\\nA survey taken by the Trust, in conjunction with the Universities of Manchester and Cambridge, found that many teachers urgently wanted further support to bolster their confidence in exploring issues of empire and migration. 83% reported a desire for additional training on teaching about migration and 74% on teaching about empire.\\nThe new African Studies Centre at NewVIc will provide a much-needed infrastructure of support so that more teachers are given the tools they need to tackle these subjects.\\nAccording to Carina Ancell, “All teachers, regardless of cultural background, must be encouraged to engage with this important section of history. We believe that it is really important that teachers who may not have a background or specialism in African history feel confident and supported in delivering materials on this topic.”\\nThe hope is that the African Studies Centre will broaden the history taught in schools and change perceptions and public knowledge of what the history of the British people actually is.\\nAlan Kunna, History Lecturer and Foundation Learning Manager at Newham Sixth Form College, said: “We close down the possibility of being one people by ignoring others or disparaging their pasts which allows for division to exist and widen. Many Black and Asian students need to be encouraged to discover the relevance of their own histories in relation to current events in Britain today.”\\nThe first session, The Issues with Teaching African History will be led by Toby Green, a senior lecturer in Lusophone African History at King’s College London, and will take place online on Wednesday 11 November at 5 pm.\\nAll sessions are free and open to all teachers across the UK, prior registration is essential and available on the College’s website: www.newvic.ac.uk/african-studies-centre',\n"," 'The latest project from Wonder Fools in association with Edinburgh’s Traverse Theatre, featuring in their unique digital Traverse Festival Programme has seen 107 groups from 51 schools, theatres and community groups across the UK sign up in just over six weeks since it was announced. The original aim to have 70 registered groups by the end of the seven-month project next March has already been surpassed and the numbers keep growing, demonstrative of the ongoing thirst for arts, culture and a sense of community as the challenges of 2020 continue.\\nThe Glasgow theatre company has enlisted five of the UK’s most exciting playwrights to create a programme of plays to be gifted to young people – aged eight to 25 – across the country to perform and adapt as they wish, for free. Positive Stories for Negative Times is a direct response to the lack of physical spaces for young people to participate in creative activities currently, and the detrimental impact that this is having on their mental health and wellbeing.\\nWorking with those from isolated areas, marginalised groups and vulnerable young people, Positive Stories for Negative Times is providing a new outlet to nurture creativity, encourage the exchange of new skills and ideas and provide a safe space online that could have a genuine impact on young people’s experience during the global pandemic.\\nLocations of those taking part so far includes Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dumfries and Galloway, Fife, Alloa, Mull, Aberdeen, Angus, Falkirk, West Lothian, East Lothian, Ayrshire, Dundee, Perth, North Berwick, London, Manchester, Oxford, Nottingham, Sussex, Northampton, Buxton, Malvern and Dorset. It has also garnered international interest with groups in Iceland and Oregon before it was officially announced.\\nWonder Fools will provide a framework of how to rehearse, direct and record the works, with specific guidance on how to deliver the project in total lockdown, through blended learning or completely live in the space – a format that enables the work to continue despite changes in government guidelines. It’s entirely free and comes with a handbook that will help teachers and group leaders deliver the work whether that be live or remotely.\\nSuzie Lundy, curriculum leader of music and drama at Edinburgh’s Royal High School commented: “Positive Stories for Negative Times is a wonderful project providing a platform for young people’s creativity and engagement at a time when they need it most. The coronavirus pandemic has limited their lives and their opportunities through the impact of lockdown and ongoing restrictions, not least through the closures of theatres and other creative venues. The Wonder Fools project gives them back the chance to create their own work and engage with professionals in the industry. It is innovative and exciting in its design and we are thrilled to able to participate.”\\nPositive Stories for Negative Times runs through to March 2021, so there’s still plenty of time for new groups to register via the website now at positivestories.scot.\\nAll performed plays will be uploaded and hosted on the bespoke platform accessible anywhere in the world where participants can see other interpretations of the same play, share with their families who can watch from afar and most importantly, continue to celebrate young people’s work in the arts despite most theatres being closed until 2021.',\n"," 'Dogs are a man’s best friend, but how about a boy or a girl’s best mate? What can the cat do to help your children do better at school? Will the presence of a rabbit’s floppy ears make your youngest become a better listener?\\nAll questions you’ve probably never asked yourself or anyone else, but the truth is having pets in the home can teach your children some valuable and positive life lessons which they can carry forward into adulthood.\\nHere’s a glimpse into the wisdom your faithful pet could be passing on to the kids.\\nA sense of responsibility\\nYou understand the burden of responsibility that comes with owning a pet. For example, the major financial responsibility that comes with purchasing and maintaining a healthy animal, and the rigours of its exercise routine, feeding times and so on and so forth.\\nThat financial responsibility stretches over the animal’s lifetime, so make sure you check your finances before going ahead and adding a new member to your family.\\nWhile your children might not get absolutely all of the background stuff that goes on with keeping a pet, they can gauge the sense of responsibility required to look after a loved one. You can help them learn by giving them age-appropriate tasks, such as getting little ones to look for when the dog’s water bowl is empty or letting older children to help with the feeding process.\\nLearning compassion and enhancing communication\\nMost household pets are highly emotionally intelligent animals. Dogs in particular display their heart on their sleeve best, and day-to-day interaction with animals can help teach your kids the basics of compassion and communication.\\nUnderstanding when a pet is happy or sad, excited or angry, in distress or wants something; this is all based on learning your pet’s behaviours and actions. Just like you, the kids will get to understand this better as time goes on, understanding the limits of communication in play and learning to work around it to develop a better relationship.\\n\\nReducing stress and behavioural issues\\nStudies have shown that children of families with pets generally have better health, are more active and struggle less with behavioural and learning issues, not to mention are generally less moody, too. This, however, is likely down to better socio-economic circumstances rather than the animals themselves, but the use of animals as therapy pets suggest there is a stress reduction, and therefore behavioural improvement attached directly to owning a pet.\\nEncouraging a healthy lifestyle\\nOwning a pet is fun, but it’s also pretty tiring at points, so why not let the kids take over with the exercise elements from time to time. Whether that’s them accompanying you out walking the dog on a day or running around with the cat in the living room, owning a pet that needs to stay active encourages your kids to do the same.\\nWhen people come to get a pet, the psychological benefits one would provide for their children probably isn’t the top reason for getting one. There is, however, a lot of evidence to say that owning a pet can help your children develop some fundamental life skills – which is an added bonus to have a cute cuddle companion around at all times.',\n"," 'Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) has awarded RBST accreditation to three new organisations, welcoming them to the expanded RBST Farm Park Accreditation Network.

The College’s rare breeds conservation programme supports Portland sheep, Wensleydale sheep, Oxford Sandy & Black pigs, Golden Guernsey goats and rare breeds of poultry.\\nLuke Gates, Head of Animal Collections at Merrist Wood said: “The RBST is an organisation that we have been passionate about supporting for many years with our first rare breeds arriving at Merrist Wood in 2000. Over the last 7 years we have been serious about developing our rare breeds for teaching and learning and supporting the RBST. We now have ten different breeds who are in need of protection due to low numbers. Many people know about giant pandas and various rhino species needing conservation support, but many of our own native livestock breeds are actually more rare.”\\nCharlie Dodd, Farm Manager at Merrist Wood added: “This year the RBST is running a campaign called Love a Longwool which is what really spurred us on to become RBST accredited this year. To become the first ever Education Facility rare breeds farm under their new framework is fantastic news for the Activate Learning group. We have just scanned our rare breeds sheep and are excited to announce all are pregnant and with the help of the RBST we look forward to do our part in conserving these breeds.”\\nActon Scott Historic Working Farm\\nActon Scott Historic Working Farm, which was the first historic working farm of its kind, specialises in practical demonstrations of historic farming using traditional skills and period horse-drawn machines. The rare breeds conservation programme at Acton Scott includes Original Population Dairy Shorthorn cattle, Gloucester Old Spot pigs, Shropshire sheep and rare breeds of poultry.\\nSarah Green, Facilities Manager at Acton Scott said: “We are very proud at Acton Scott to have been awarded with RBST Accreditation as our animals are not only beautiful, they are also a vital part of our social history. It is wonderful to be able to share their importance with a wider audience.”\\nAlmond Valley Heritage Centre\\nAlmond Valley is set either side of the River Almond and home to the historic Livingston Mill. It’s conservation programme supports rare breeds including Clydesdale horses, Tamworth pigs, North Ronaldsay sheep, Bagot goats, Golden Guernsey goats and rare breeds of poultry.\\nCraig Holmes, Farm Manager at Almond Valley Discovery Centre, said: “Almond Valley Heritage Centre are delighted to have become an RBST accredited Farm Park, a lot of hard work has gone into the farm over the last 18 months so it is great to be rewarded with this highly sought after accreditation. We are committed to the conservation of rare breeds, and inspiring our visitors to have an interest in Britain’s native rare breeds. It is fantastic to be central Scotland’s only ‘RBST Accredited Farm Park’ an approved conservation centre, acting as a hub for members of the public to visit and see native breeds conservation in action, with only one other in Scotland.

The programme is co-created with teachers and comprises sessions and workshops that support curriculum-based learning at all key stages and abilities. The aim is to help people become ocean literate and #ThinkOcean.\\nTeachers can download self-contained lessons featuring video and resources, which link to the primary science curriculum and uses the Ocean as a tool for exploring the curriculum. The lessons are totally accessible and easy for teachers to use and have been piloted through the Connect Academy Trust.\\nIn addition, the Ocean Conservation Trust is launching virtual tours, where visitors can virtually pass between the three distinct zones of the aquarium; the first covering local coasts and rockpool shallows and marine life that’s found slightly off shore; the second exhibits the inhabitants of the Atlantic Ocean, where some of the aquarium’s biggest animals live – such as the sharks and turtles; and the third region covering the tropical reefs – with familiar favourites Nemo and Dory – as well as follow up science activities, there are follow up art and literacy activities; all of which will be evaluated to see what learning has taken place.

Partner organisations include a counselling service and agencies with expertise in welfare rights and immigration issues.\\nA primary school started hosting information and advice sessions for parents focusing on financial and employment support, as part of a wider goal to increase children’s attendance at extended school activities. The school also surveyed pupils directly using a child-friendly electronic survey to understand their views on out-of-school provision and help ensure finance was not a barrier to taking part.\\nAlison Garnham, Chief Executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: “Many schools in London are already providing families in need with emergency help and food, but some schools want to go beyond this kind of emergency help and do more to routinely support children and parents. Our guide aims to inform these schools and offer them practical advice. We recognise that schools are managing heavy workloads and facing many challenges due to Covid-19; and ultimately it is for Governments, not schools, to prevent poverty. But small actions can improve children’s experience of school and allow them to engage more fully with education. Londoners want every child to have the chance to reach their potential but the pandemic is likely to see more of the capital’s children fall below the poverty line. Now more than ever, schools have a crucial role to play to protect London’s children from the potentially lifelong effects of poverty.”\\nDr Debbie Weekes-Bernard, Deputy Mayor for Social Integration, Social Mobility and Community Engagement, Greater London Authority, said: “Every child has the right to a good education but for children living in poverty, key elements of school life – from going on trips to taking part in clubs – incur unmanageable costs.\\n“The coronavirus pandemic has shone a light on the deep inequalities in our society and it is increasingly clear that it is the households and families with the least who are suffering most.\\n“This report offers schools practical guidance on how to better support low-income families, empowering teachers to consider alternate ways of organising learning and enabling all children, whatever their background to achieve their very best at school.”\\nhttps://cpag.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/policypost/Tackling-child-poverty-a-guide-for-schools.pdf',\n"," 'Batley based Birstall Primary Academy has received the PSQM GILT award after its efforts and sustained improvements in raising the profile of science across its whole school community.\\nThe GILT is awarded to those schools who have clearly established science leadership, successful teacher autonomy and innovation, development into science teaching and learning, and has shown a positive impact across all year groups.\\nIn the feedback received, the school were praised for its ‘enriched’ subject experience and for its initiatives such as its science ambassadors’ and science club which were oversubscribed due to pupil popularity.\\nThe school’s efforts to engrain science wider than the classroom has also been commended after the school facilitated a dedicated parent and pupil project and have supported parents in carrying out investigations and experiments from home during the coronavirus lockdown period.\\nThis continued professional development programme has seen the school bolster its already successful science programme and as schools return in the next academic year, the teaching staff want to increase science capital with dedicated career learning sessions.\\nThe school is amongst 160 schools from across the country who have received this prestigious accreditation.\\nAssociate Professor Jane Turner, PSQM National Director said: “Schools that have achieved a Primary Science Quality Mark have demonstrated a significant commitment to science teaching and learning, even at this challenging time for schools.\\n“Children are engaging with great science both in and outside the classroom, developing positive attitudes towards science as well as secure scientific understanding and skills.\\n“Science subject leaders, their colleagues, head teachers, children, parents and governors should be very proud.”\\nJayde Weir, Vice Principal at Birstall Primary Academy and lead on the project commented: “Thanks to the collective hard work of our dedicated staff throughout the school we have been able to enhance our science curriculum and begin to not just make this part of our school culture, but the wider communities too.\\n“We’ve had some excellent feedback from parents with children teaching younger siblings what they have learnt in the classroom which shows their level of engagement and enthusiasm for science.\\n“We are now looking to see how we can further improve on the next academic year, as for us what is most important is that we continue to thrive and provide our pupils with the best education possible.”\\nBirstall Primary Academy operates as part of Focus Trust – a charitable multi-academy trust which is based in the North West of England with a vision of providing an engaging and challenging learning environment where the children are happy.\\nFind out more about the PSQM at http://www.psqm.org.uk/.',\n"," 'Little Troopers, the military children’s charity, has launched new secondary school resources to help teachers support children aged 11-16 who have parents serving in the British Armed Forces.\\nCreated alongside teachers, forces families and behavioural experts, the resources offer lots of practical ideas to get children talking about forces life in school and can be used by any secondary school with service children – be that one service child or two hundred.\\nAccording to research from the charity, 96% of military parents would like schools to offer more specific support for military children and 38% said that moving school was an aspect of military life that their child struggled with the most. Other challenges faced by service children include being regularly separated from their serving parent, living away from extended family and moving home frequently.\\nThe Little Troopers Secondary School Resource Hub is available on the Little Troopers website where education settings can now explore and download any of the lesson plans, activity templates and teacher training information. As well as one-off military-themed lessons and activity templates covering creative writing, sports activities, events, media skills, community engagement suggestions and more, the charity will also be adding details of how to set up a Forces Life Club in school.\\nIn addition, the charity will be launching a secondary school Military Child Wellbeing Course template later this term and schools can now apply to receive this in the post. The six-session wellbeing course provides targeted early intervention and wellbeing support for all military children, not just those in crisis, and covers the topics of separation, deployment, house moves and living abroad, as well as the personal themes of belonging, identity and mindfulness. The course template includes everything schools need to deliver the course including a slide deck, facilitator notes, invitations, props and print-outs as well as everything on a USB.\\nThe course can be integrated into schools’ existing wellbeing strategy and gives forces children the opportunity to explore specific themes and issues associated with military life. The aim is to empower all military children with positive strategies that they can use to cope with any challenges they face due to having a parent serving in the Armed Forces.\\nLittle Troopers already has a Primary School Resource Pack and Primary School Wellbeing Course which are now used in hundreds of primary schools across the UK.\\nLouise Fetigan, founder of Little Troopers, comments: “As a charity, we think it is really important that military children feel recognised and included in school and are given the opportunity to talk about military life and share their experiences with their peers. The Secondary Resource Hub is packed with lots of practical and fun ways to do this. Meanwhile the Military Child Wellbeing Course template offers more targeted wellbeing support for military children in school to make sure they have the tools to cope with some of the more challenging aspects of forces life such as being separated from their serving parent and moving home and school frequently.\\n“We’ve wanted to create these resources for a really long time and we are very grateful to The Armed Forces Covenant Fund who have provided us with a £15,000 grant to enable us to make these secondary resources free to all schools.”\\nTo download items from the Little Troopers Secondary Resource Hub and to apply for a copy of the Little Troopers Secondary Military Child Wellbeing Course visit www.littletroopers.net/littletroopersatschool',\n"," 'Children’s food and farming education initiative Kids Country have announced the launch of their annual Winter Warmer Soup Challenge, which this year will be judged by MasterChef 2018 finalist, Simon Spooner.\\nSimon is an award-winning private chef who reached the top 10 of MasterChef in 2018 and now runs the private catering and events company Knife Fork and Spooner based near Stamford, Lincolnshire.

Due to Covid19 restrictions, there has been a dramatic decrease in school groups undertaking educational visits. This is impacting on the educational opportunities available to children and is threatening the survival of those organisations providing these experiences.\\nPaul Rose, television presenter, expedition leader for National Geographic’s Pristine Seas Expeditions and former vice president of the Royal Geographic Society, said his life was turned around by a school trip when he was a teenager: “I failed my Eleven Plus and hated school. I just couldn’t see the point of anything. Then in Secondary school my Geography teacher took my class to the Brecon Beacons. All the horrors of education and learning disappeared. It was truly inspirational. At last things made sense – if I wanted to use a map and compass then I needed Maths. If I wanted to understand the map and the ground, then I needed Geography. That trip was the making of me, it was what I desperately needed. That was my door opening, it was me becoming Paul Rose. We cannot let these opportunities disappear.”\\nKate Humble, television presenter, wildlife specialist and author, said: “Lessons in a classroom can only achieve so much.\\xa0 School trips I took to see the geological features we were learning about in geography, or to the Natural History Museum, or simply to our local park to collect leaves & pinecones, brought those lessons alive.\\xa0 They made sense of things, gave us all a greater understanding & appreciation of what we were learning, and made our newfound knowledge something exciting.\\xa0 They were an invaluable part of my education.”\\nDr Anne Hunt, Chief Executive for the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom (CLOtC), said: “Covid related school closures and restrictions are resulting in organisations who provide high quality educational visits closing their venues and losing whole teams of staff and volunteers. With no overnight visits since March and for the foreseeable future, the providers of residential learning experiences are facing particularly challenging circumstances. There is a very real possibility that many organisations providing these very valuable learning opportunities simply won’t survive the current crisis, meaning a whole generation of pupils could go through school without experiencing a visit to a museum, a field studies trip or a foreign language tour.”\\nEven though UK-based educational day visits are permitted by the Department for Education, the impact of the pandemic on providers is becoming very stark and it is hitting organisations big and small – the National Trust is currently consulting on a proposal that would make all its learning staff redundant, PGL has lost a quarter of its workforce, STA Travel ceased trading in August, and Cheddar Caves has closed ‘for the foreseeable future’.\\nDr Hunt continues: “Alongside the impact on the\\xa0 dedicated skilled staff and volunteers who run these inspiring programmes, these closures will push the opportunities for educational visits beyond the reach of the many thousands of children who we know do not get the chance to have these experiences in any other way than with their schools.’’\\nThe evidence is clear that learning outside the classroom, including through well-planned educational visits supports pupils to engage with their learning and delivers a wide range of socio-emotional outcomes that underpin their achievement and attainment. It also has a positive impact on children’s health and wellbeing.\\xa0 School-based learning outside the classroom opportunities should be an integral part of strategies for supporting all children and young people to recover from the consequences of disrupted learning.\\nProf Justin Dillon, Professor of Science and Environmental Education at Exeter University, said: “There is a wealth of evidence that learning outside the classroom can have a transformative impact on education and learning. Given that the National Foundation for Education Research has reported recently that the gap in inequalities between children from different social backgrounds has widened already by 46% in a year, it is clear that educational visits can play a crucial role in enabling pupils to ‘catch up’ and address this widening inequality in education.”\\nMartin Smith, Chair of the Outdoor Education Advisers’ Panel said: “The Department for Education has given approval for schools to take day visits off-site. We strongly encourage schools to utilise local venues, grounds and amenities to help bring some normality back to student’s lives and build confidence in undertaking educational visits further a field. Such activities are essential for young people in terms of broadening their horizons and to help accelerate their learning. We also need insurance companies to cover educational visits for Covid-related cancellations. Without this, teachers aren’t able to plan ahead which is further affecting the ability of educational visit providers to recover from the pandemic.’’\\nTo support the educational visits sector and protect these vital opportunities for children and young people, the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom, the Outdoor Education Advisers Panel, School Travel Forum and the Expedition Providers Association are working with Government to advocate for:\\n\\nRecognising the positive benefits that learning outside the classroom and educational visits can deliver and their role in helping address widening inequalities\\nReiterating the recommendation that schools can take their learning off-site and on day visits, and work with other learning providers to bring their services into schools, as long as these follow school Covid secure guidelines\\nWorking with insurance companies to ensure future educational visits are covered for cancellations arising due to Covid so schools can start planning for the future.\\n\\nDr Hunt continues: “There is a unique opportunity for the learning outside the classroom sector to be mobilised to support more schools to take their learning beyond the classroom, dramatically increasing health, wellbeing and learning outcomes for all children and young people. If we do nothing there is a very real risk that these benefits will only be available to some children and young people and many of these experiences may no longer be available at all when restrictions are finally lifted. If we fail to act now, a whole generation of children may miss out.”',\n"," 'Fife College has brought in an innovative system to live stream lessons to students to make sure that they don’t miss out on their learning experience.\\nThe College is currently using a blended learning approach due to the Coronavirus, with some students carrying out their studies online.\\nFor subjects such as Maths and Biology this has led to classes being split in two, with students rotating who will be in class and who will be studying from home each week.\\nHowever this had the potential to limit the amount of face-to-face teaching students received, so the College has introduced a live-stream of lessons, meaning that those studying at home can participate in the class and ask questions of the lecturer throughout.\\nThe classes also include an interactive whiteboard so that students can see what is being written up by the lecturer and interact with it, and it also allows for captions to be included and for an interpreter to appear on screen for those who are hearing impaired.\\nIf students are unable to watch the lesson as it happens, they also have the opportunity to watch a recording of it that is uploaded on to Microsoft Teams afterwards.\\nStewart McDonald, Academic Head for Engineering, Science and Mathematics at Fife College, said: “Given the measures we’ve put in place to ensure the health and safety of staff at Fife College, it’s not been possible to have all students return to class.\\n“This left some facing a reduction in the amount of face-to-face teaching time that they receive, which could potentially have an impact on their studies.\\n“The College’s priority during these times is to ensure the best possible learning experience for all students, which is why we developed this system of live streaming lessons to those who aren’t in class.\\n“Not only does it allow them to follow lessons as they happen, but they can ask questions and take part in class activities as they happen.\\n“We’ve already had great feedback from students, and we’ll continue to investigate ways that we can enhance their learning experience.”\\nThe online system has proved popular with students, with Alexandra Marjoram, a student studying National 4 Maths at Fife College saying it helped her feel as if she was still in the lesson with her classmates. She said: “It was good because despite being at home I still felt I was part of the class, I could see what was going on and raise my hand and ask questions if I had any queries.\\n“I could hear what other students who were studying from home were saying so it felt like we were one big class despite having been separated into different bubbles.\\n“If you’re needing any help or you’re struggling you can ask questions, go back to previous lectures, or you can communicate with your classmates on the chat function.”\\nNatalie Fisher, who is also on the National 4 Maths course is hearing impaired, and said the technology helped her understanding of lessons.\\n“The advantage is I can see live captions at the same time as the interpreter as some English is different from the British Sign Language, and now I have both.\\n“I and others who are hard of hearing have hearing aids on so we can listen in to the lesson through those which is another advantage.”',\n"," 'TransUnion, one of the UK’s leading credit reference agencies, has teamed up with Premier League football club Leeds United to take its education programme – Credit Scores Explained – into schools.\\nFocusing on being financially fit in preparation for adult life, the #KnowYourScore initiative will launch in Leeds, ahead of a national rollout next year.\\nKelli Fielding, managing director of consumer interactive at TransUnion in the UK said: “Our Credit Scores Explained course will be delivered in secondary schools, in partnership with the Leeds United Foundation. Our aim is to give teens the best start to their financial life, helping them learn more about managing money and understanding from an early age the role that their credit report and score can play.\\n“This information can help prepare them for their adult lives, whatever path they choose, and is particularly timely, as COVID-19 exacerbates financial stresses. Nearly a third (31%) of teens say their parents talking about money worries is making them think more about finance, according to our recent survey.”\\nPaul Bell, executive director at Leeds United added: “We’re really pleased to be working with TransUnion on this, so that together we can support the community and help teach young people important life skills. Our charity foundation has a strong rapport with numerous local schools, and the interest we’ve had to date has been fantastic, so we’re looking forward to getting started.”\\nThe course, which is for young people aged between 13 and 18, will cover specific aspects of managing money and the role credit information plays in day-to-day life, with lessons aligning to financial education frameworks.\\nIt follows a successful pilot programme last year with three local secondary schools, including Corpus Christi in Leeds. Mr Stones, lead teacher of business and enterprise there said: “The students found the session to be enlightening, engaging and informative. As a college we appreciate the support and insight that private organisations such as TransUnion can provide to help us equip our students for their futures.”\\nThe latest research from TransUnion confirms the need to combat a lack of wider financial awareness amongst teenagers. One in seven young people (14%) lack confidence in basic money skills, only a third feel confident they can stick to a budget (36%) and just a tenth (9%) are comfortable keeping up repayments on money loaned. Whilst the majority look to their parents for money advice, lessons at school and banks are the next most important sources of this information.\\nFor TransUnion’s e-book explaining credit reports and scores click here or to find out more about the Leeds United Foundation visit the website.',\n"," 'A new multi-academy trust, The Learning Alliance (TLA), has been officially launched with the merger of two existing successful trusts – Cambridgeshire Educational Trust (CET) and Morris Education Trust (MET).\\nCET (which included Chesterton Community College and Downham Market Academy) and MET (which included Impington Village College, Impington International College and Witchford Village College) each had strong track records for academic excellence and innovation. Together, they now offer the widest range of subject and qualification options of any non-selective secondary school or sixth form in Cambridgeshire. These include GCSEs, A Levels, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Programme, Diploma Programme and Career-related Programme, and BTECs.\\nHeading the new trust’s leadership team are Lucy Scott, of Chesterton Community College, which consistenly achieves in the top 1% of schools in the country for exam performance and is rated outstanding by Ofsted, and Ryan Kelsall, previously Principal of Impington Village College, which was selected as State School of the Year in East Anglia in the Sunday Times Parent Power list 2020.\\nLucy Scott, CEO of TLA, said: “Our new Trust is a small purposeful family of schools, each with its own distinct identity which, combined, offer more choice than any other group of schools, enabling every student to pursue their dreams and passions. As our Trust grows, each school will retain that identity but share the same values and standards of academic rigour, excellent extra-curricular opportunities and exceptional arts and performing arts.\\n“What makes TLA so very different is that it is born out of an alliance between two existing trusts, not out of a need for one school to grow. Our joint commitment is to being proudly international and internationally minded, serving a diverse community of families from Cambridge, across the UK and overseas, facilitated by our host family network, with a broad, specialist and inclusive provision.\\nRyan Kelsall, Deputy CEO of TLA, added: “Our new Trust offers a truly international experience for students with over 40 different languages spoken by students at Chesterton Community College alone. We value equality and promote diversity in our schools and are committed to continuing to increase the number of our students studying languages in KS4.”\\nRolf Purvis, Headteacher at Downham Market Academy, is part of the Trust’s new senior leadership team and has become the new Executive Headteacher at Witchford Village College. He said: “Within the Trust’s team we really do have an enviable wealth of teaching and school improvement experience, evidenced by the success of Downham Market Academy and its Athena Sixth Form College, since they became part of CET in 2017.”\\nLucy Scott concluded: “Our existing schools have long track records for supporting students in achieving their full potential in a happy, respectful and nurturing environment. They also have reputations for providing excellent professional development opportunities for teachers and staff and, through our merger, we are combining all of this knowledge, experience and insight.”',\n"," 'Layla Assi (aged 16) from Stockport, Greater Manchester, studying at Southport College, Merseyside, has been named the winner of “Best Campaign” in advertising and digital skills competition, Rise Up 2020. Part of The Code from global advertising, marketing and digital agency, Dentsu, Rise Up 2020 challenged young people from diverse backgrounds to put their creativity to the test and develop a purpose-led brand campaign for Cadbury.\\nThe young talent impressed the judges, including Cadbury’s Senior Brand Manager, Claudia Miceli and Brand Manager, Lyndsey Homer, as well as Paola Cassinelli, Senior Brand Manager from Mondelēz and Lauren Ashleigh Kelly, Client Director from Dentsu’s agency, Carat.\\nThe winning campaign recommends using biodegradable paper wrappers, including a limited edition seeded card that can be planted to grow into plants and flowers. The judges were particularly impressed with the concept of taking something with a negative image and impact – packaging and wrappers – and turning it into a positive asset that helps promote biodiversity.\\nIn her winning pitch to the judges, Layla Assi explained:\\n“It’s about time we started looking after the planet. Cadbury can be seen as a company that cares about the world’s future as well as their customers. Young, old, Cadbury consumers would be making a contribution to their ecosystem by simply buying a bar of chocolate. Cadbury really can feed the planet one wrapper at a time.”\\nThe annual Rise Up competition, now in its fourth year, provides young people with a real-world client brief and support to create and present an advertising and marketing campaign to a panel of senior industry decision-makers. This year’s competition called on young people to create a campaign for Cadbury. They were challenged to shine a light on everyday moments of generosity and kindness, building on Cadbury’s history of social justice and community spirit, to show how the brand can inspire and showcase a little more goodness in the world.\\nThe Code was launched in January 2017 in the UK as a proactive solution to the industry-wide need to promote a diverse workforce reflective of the population. It aims to excite young people about careers in advertising, digital industries and marketing. Dentsu works with schools in areas of low social mobility across the UK, specifically with schools that have an above-average percentage of students of BAME heritage and also above-average numbers of young people entitled to free school meals. 240 young people joined Rise Up 2020; 52% of competition entrants were from BAME backgrounds and 61% were female. The Code’s name is derived from its four pillars: Creativity, Opportunity, Diversity, Empowerment.\\nEuan Jarvie, CEO, Dentsu UK and Ireland, said: “2020 has been a challenging year for young people who have had to contend not only with studying remotely during lockdown, but also seeing opportunities for work experience and training dry up. We were determined to make sure Rise Up remained accessible for the young people taking part in The Code to enable as many as possible to enter this year’s competition. Layla’s concept stood out for its environmental impact and clear link to an urgent issue. We’re all looking forward to seeing the idea evolve when Layla joins the Mondelēz and Carat brand teams for work experience, and know she has a bright future ahead of her.\\n“The advertising industry cannot expect to connect and engage diverse audiences with impactful brand campaigns if the teams behind them are not equally as diverse. In 2016, we recognised that starting to resolve the lack of diversity in the advertising industry would mean directly reaching out to people of different heritages, life experiences and social backgrounds, and exciting them about careers in fields they may never have considered. That is good for us, it’s good for the young people and schools taking part, and ultimately it’s good for the brands we work with.”\\nLyndsey Homer, Brand Manager, Mondelēz (parent company of Cadbury’s), said: “Congratulations to Layla for creating an engaging and timely campaign. It has been a tough year for so many people up and down the country. The thousands of examples of generosity and kindness we’ve all witnessed have been essential to getting the nation through this crisis. Rise Up called on young creative minds to show that there’s a ‘glass and a half’ in everyone and showcase those acts of goodness. Layla’s campaign achieves that and more.”\\nChiana Pettitt from Southend High School in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, was also highly commended by the judges for her one-minute elevator pitch. Her slogan, “Kindness and generosity is happiness – happiness is Cadbury”, captured the judges’ attention. So too did her wider campaign encouraging consumers to complete a bingo-style board of acts of kindness – from cooking a meal for a neighbour to saying ‘good morning’ to a stranger – and sharing their moments of generosity on social media.\\nIn addition, all of the Rise Up 2020 finalists were surprised at the virtual awards ceremony with the offer of mentoring sessions with Dentsu experts to talk about life, school and their career paths. Each of the finalists received an XBOX Game Pass too to reward their impressive efforts.\\nFor more details about The Code and Rise Up, and to explore the digital curriculum, visit www.thecode-dentsu.com',\n"," 'Stratford Girl’s Grammar School student Kirsty Duncan has won the national Mother Tongue Other Tongue KS5 French competition for 2020.\\nMother Tongue Other Tongue is a national multilingual poetry competition that celebrates cultural diversity and the many languages currently spoken in schools across the UK.

It has since rolled out across the country and become a nationally recognised award, with students from all over the UK competing for the annual prize.\\xa0Mother Tongue Other Tongue is officially endorsed by Malala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner and education activist.\\nThis year, ‘other tongue’ entries required an original poem written in a language that is not the first language spoken by the student writing it. Entries could be provided in Spanish, German, Italian, or French.\\nKirsty initially entered the competition during the height of the coronavirus pandemic that saw schools close and students study from home, attending all of their classes virtually. The competition was suggested to Kirsty by her French teacher at Stratford Girls’ Grammar School as an extra way to apply herself with language learning during this time.\\nKirsty said, “I enjoy linguistic challenges like these as they are always a bit like a puzzle. I wasn’t expecting to finish the poem at first, \\xa0because I thought it would be too difficult to get it to rhyme or to keep a coherent theme throughout. But after writing each verse, I discovered I really enjoyed constructing each line. In the end, I created something that I was proud of, regardless of the competition results. When I found out that I had been named the winner, I was really over the moon. It was definitely a confidence boost before taking my mock French exam the next day!”\\nIn addition to being named this years KS5 French winner, Kirsty also received an Amazon gift voucher. Stephanie Wood is Head of Modern Foreign Language studies at Stratford Girls’ Grammar School, she said,\\n“We are very proud of what Kirsty has achieved with her fantastic poem and ongoing commitment to learning. Competitions like Mother Tongue Other Tongue are incredibly welcomed by our school as they help broaden students understanding beyond the classroom, which is especially important after the unexpected lockdown situation earlier this year. Students have now returned to our school, but we are still encouraging them to enter more competitions, such as those celebrating the European Day of Languages this month.

Some of them may not have been so successful in their traditional schools previously, but they clearly love learning here.\\n“They told me a key reason they came to this school is because they’ve got a very good chance of having a great career afterwards.\\n“To me, this is the future and this school is truly fit for the 21st century. The organisational ethos is second to none and there is a really great atmosphere.\\n“It’s all down to leadership. Every time I’ve visited a great school, I’ve found it’s because it has a brilliant leadership team.”\\nMr Halfon added: “I’m a huge supporter of UTCs because I think they’re the future of learning and they’re doing things that are absolutely vital because the world is changing. I would love it if there were many more UTCs like Ron Dearing UTC – one in every town and city.\\n“A fourth industrial revolution is under way, driven by technology, and 28% of jobs that are currently done by young people could be lost to automation.\\n“This is why education has to change.

They provide an additional platform for all pupils to engage in a creative environment that allows them to grow, thrive and learn on their journey through the school.\\nIn the primary school pupils take part in weekly drama, dance and music lessons and secondary pupils continue to participate in all performing arts subjects, with the addition of studying film studies from year 9 to GCSE.\\nPerforming arts facilities at the school include a studio theatre, music teaching spaces and a TV and film production studio and a spacious main hall. The Bedford Music Hub is also based on the school site and this strong partnership offers networking opportunities and the sharing of resources and expertise.\\nOver recent years the 4SIXTEEN Theatre Company, the school’s in-house theatre company under the direction of the school’s resident theatre director, has produced a number of award-winning shows including The Lion King, The Railway Children, We Will Rock you and The Addams Family. The company are currently rehearsing (within government guidelines due to Covid-19) for their next production Sister Act.\\nRuth Wilkes, Federation Principal, said “We are incredibly proud of our pupils and their achievements within performing arts and the NODA awards won for the school productions are testament to the dedication, hard work and expertise of the staff and pupils involved in these magnificent and high quality theatre productions.”\\nLuke Skeel, Federation Head of Performing Arts said, “Watching our pupils from an early age engaging in the arts is so powerful. The arts are integral to the wellbeing and development of all children.

Now it is calling on schools to sign up.\\nThe primary school campaign, Let’s Count!, is a cross-curricular programme developed in conjunction with Family and Education and their education resource centre, iChild. The education programme is designed to excite children and families alike about the census.\\nLet’s Count! has achieved accreditation from Mathematics in Education and Industry, National Association for the Teaching of English, and the Geographical Association. With maths and statistics at its core, the programme provides flexible lesson plans and engaging activities for pupils to learn how they can use statistics across many topics.\\nBritish historian, Professor David Olusoga OBE, is also on board and he will be delivering a special live stream lesson on equality and representation.\\nProfessor Olusoga said: “I am thrilled to be part of this campaign. I passionately believe in public history and above all in making the stories of everyone and every community in the UK accessible to children. 2020 has been a year in which young people have shown us that equality and representation, the issues my lesson will explore, are issues that acutely matter to them. The census – as ever – will provide a snapshot of who we are as a nation. History explains how we got here.”\\nMeanwhile, a secondary school campaign has been developed by EVERFI EdComs. The programme was co-created with teachers and students to develop engaging content to help raise awareness of the census with a pre-launch film profiling the diverse voices of the census being released today. Students will explore why the census matters to them and their local communities, covering topics across the curriculum.\\nIain Bell, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “These programmes offer a great opportunity for children to learn about the importance of the census. They help children learn more about maths and their own local area, and they will also raise awareness of the census, which informs many important issues like the number of school place or hospital beds. By running programmes in primary and secondary schools across England and Wales, we want to engage pupils of all ages in the census and by doing so make Census 2021 a huge success.”\\nThe Let’s Count! primary school campaign was piloted during the 2019 Census rehearsal, with many schools taking part within the rehearsal areas. A selection of schools also took part in the Let’s Count! competition, creating school-centred census displays, with Jubilee Primary School in Hackney being crowned the winners.\\nGeorge Gould, Head of Year 6 at Jubilee Primary school, said: “This competition was a great way of developing all of our children’s statistics and citizenship skills, speaking and listening to members of the local community and collecting and presenting data.”\\nPhil Bird, CEO of Family & Education/iChild said: “We are delighted to be part of this unique event, and excited to develop and share time-saving Census 2021 education resources with our iChild network. The Let’s Count! programme will help improve maths, geography and writing skills, using Census 2021, a significant real-life event, as a stimulus. It has accreditation and exclusive content from MEI, NATE and the Geographical Association.”\\nThe Secondary School Education Programme will aim to engage young people, empowering them to use their voices to encourage their families and community to complete the census. The programme will use real-world tasks to explore how data is used and influences decisions across society. The lesson content will inspire whole-school participation and link to curriculum subjects such as citizenship, PSHE, maths and history.\\nDarren Sayer, Secondary Deputy Headteacher at Hanson Academy, Bradford, said: “The census is a very worthwhile topic and the resources provided by this programme form a very valuable insight into why data and information are so important and how they can affect change.”\\nNick Fuller, President of EVERFI EdComs said: “It’s great to be part of this historic campaign and we at EVERFI EdComs want to ensure young people and their families understand what Census 2021 means for them and the communities they live in.”\\nIt is hoped the school campaigns will help raise awareness of the digital-first census, happening on 21 March 2021. The census occurs once every ten years and provides a snapshot of households in England and Wales, helping to plan and fund public services.\\nSchools can sign up to the education programmes now, by visiting http://bit.ly/censuseducation',\n"," 'A new survey from the British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) analyses how the healthy eating habits and physical activity levels of both children and adults have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, throughout the lockdown and now in the recent period of eased restrictions. The survey, conducted as part of BNF Healthy Eating Week 2020, reveals that 50 percent of primary school children and 26 percent of secondary school students say that they feel better or healthier now that they are back at school, while 27 percent of adults say they feel more healthy since lockdown restrictions were eased (July) compared with during the lockdown that started in March this year.\\nOver half (56 percent) of primary school children and exactly half (50 percent) of secondary school students surveyed say that they are more active now that they are back at school. Only 11 percent of primary school children and secondary school students say that they are now less active than before they went back to school. However, almost one third (29 percent) of adults state they are less active now than before lockdown started in March.\\nThe survey also indicates the extent to which adults and secondary school children have turned to ‘comfort’ foods and drinks throughout the pandemic. Nearly half (46 percent) of adults and 43 percent of secondary school students say that they have consumed more chocolate when feeling tired, stressed, bored or anxious throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. 41 percent of adults and 35 percent of secondary school students have consumed more cakes or biscuits; 33 percent of adults and 41 percent of secondary school students have eaten more crisps; and 13 percent of adults and 28 percent of secondary school students have drunk more sugary drinks. Well over a third (35 percent) of all adults say that they have consumed more alcohol when feeling tired, stressed, bored or anxious during the pandemic.\\nIn contrast, 37 percent of secondary students and 18 percent of adults report eating more fruit, and 21 percent of secondary students and 12 percent of adults report eating more vegetables when feeling tired, stressed, bored or anxious.\\nSara Stanner, Science Director at BNF says: “As we navigate this next stage of the pandemic, we know that being in good health is more important than ever to help us stay well, but making healthy choices isn’t always easy. The unprecedented effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our lives have challenged all of us so it’s great to see our survey suggest that many children are feeling healthier and are more active now they are getting back to school. However, it’s not surprising that many adults and secondary students have been reaching for less healthy foods when tired, stressed or anxious.\\n“BNF Healthy Eating Week aims to support children and adults to make more informed choices and to lead healthier lives by increasing knowledge of healthy eating and wellbeing, and the benefits of physical activity and cooking. 4,929 schools and nurseries, and 1,324 workplaces (or workplace teams), colleges and universities across the UK are taking part in BNF Healthy Eating Week 2020 (28 September to 4 October). The week’s activities include seven daily health challenges, which people are encouraged to take part in at school, in the workplace, or at home.”\\nOne of the BNF Healthy Eating Week challenges is to ‘Eat more wholegrains’. The BNF survey suggests that knowledge of what wholegrain foods are among both children and adults is varied. Wholegrain foods such as bran flakes, oats, wholegrain bread and wholemeal pasta were all correctly identified by many, for example, over 40 percent of primary and over 80 percent of secondary school children and adults said that wholemeal bread is a wholegrain food. However, over 30 percent of primary and secondary school children think that basmati rice is a wholegrain food and over 20 percent of adults think that couscous is a wholegrain. Beans, potatoes with skins and dried fruit were also selected by many respondents and, although these provide fibre, they do not count as wholegrain.\\nBNF Healthy Eating Week also highlights the value of including a variety of different fruits and vegetables in the diet. The new survey explores consumption of fruit and vegetables among the different age groups and finds that children report eating more fruit than adults, while adults report consuming more vegetables. 52 percent of primary school children and 53 percent of secondary school students say they usually eat three or more portions of fruit each day, compared with 44 percent of adults. 53 percent of primary school children and 58 percent of secondary school students report that they eat three or more portions of vegetables each day, compared with 64 percent of adults. One in 10 primary school children and 7 percent of secondary school students say that, if they could, they would eat no vegetables at all, while a fifth (20 percent) of primary school children and 14 percent of secondary school students would choose to only ever eat one type of vegetable.\\nPrimary school children who took part in the survey were asked to name their three favourite vegetables. The clear winner is carrots (68 percent of children), followed by beetroot (36 percent), cauliflower (32 percent) and cucumber (31 percent). Parsnips, swede and pak choi are joint last in the primary school children’s vegetable league table (0.3 percent each).\\nSecondary school students and adults were asked to select all of the different types of vegetables they have eaten in the last two weeks. For secondary school students, carrots also top the list, included by 84 percent. This is followed by onions, broccoli, cucumber and peas, which are each included by over 60 percent. Tomatoes are the most frequently mentioned vegetable for adults, included by 89 percent of respondents. Carrots, onions and peppers are the next most frequently included, mentioned by over 80 percent of adults. Over 70 percent of adults report eating beans (e.g. baked beans), broccoli, cucumber, lettuce and peas in the previous two weeks. Okra and celeriac are the least consumed vegetables in both age groups.\\nThe BNF survey also asked about the social eating habits of the different age groups within the home and found that half (50 percent) of all primary school children say that they eat with other people at home five or more nights of each week, with 42 percent of these eating with others every night of the week. The number of secondary school students who say they eat with other people in the home, without the distraction of technology (TV, mobile phones, laptops, etc), five or more times a week is 53 percent, 38 percent of those eating together every night of the week. Less than a third (29 percent) of adults say that they eat with other family members, without distractions, every night of the week and 42 percent say they eat with others at home five or more nights each week.\\nStanner concluded: “From our survey, while it’s good to see that many adults and children report eating with others at home regularly, about 20 percent of all groups we surveyed say they never eat with others at home without the distraction of TV, phones or other technologies. One of the BNF Healthy Eating Week challenges is to eat together and this is something that can help build healthy eating habits for children, as well as providing an ideal opportunity to chat and catch up without other distractions. Our other weekend challenge is to get active together and we asked secondary students and adults whether exercising with other helps motivate them to be active – 68 percent of adults and 73 percent of secondary students agreed. So, getting active with others, bearing in mind current measures to control the spread of COVID-19, could be a great way for many to get moving.”',\n"," 'The Royal British Legion, together with the National Literary Trust, has created a range of teaching resources for children in Key Stages 1-4, designed to help them explore their shared heritage of Remembrance and understand its relevance to today.\\nIn a year where the nation marked 75 years since Victory in Europe, Victory over Japan and 70 years since the beginning of the war in Korea, the Legion is also encouraging people to acknowledge the contribution of a new generation of Armed Forces who have responded alongside essential workers on the frontline in the fight against Covid-19.\\nThe Legion’s new resources are designed to help children draw parallels between these modern-day challenges and the Second World War generation, highlighting the significance of Remembrance in today’s world.

There are no rules, so participants can also share their creative work through art, music, spoken word, photography or a combination of media.\\nAs well as awards for individuals and schools, each person’s creative submission will generate a £3 donation from The Bupa Foundation to the partner charities to support mental wellbeing projects for young people.\\nRecent research from Mind shows that two thirds of young people said that their mental health worsened during lockdown. According to research by the National Literacy Trust, 2 in 5 children said writing made them feel better during lockdown and 1 in 4 children said writing helped when they felt sad that they couldn’t see friends and family.\\nBeyond Words for World Mental Health Day is supported by leading children’s authors including Matt Goodfellow and Jennifer Bell, as well as poets Sophia Thakur and Caleb Parkin. They have provided their thoughts to inspire entrants across the UK to take part.\\nWriting about how he used words to support his thinking during the pandemic Caleb, a poet said: “When things were at their most confusing and chaotic during lockdown I wrote ‘morning pages’ of whatever was in my head. I still haven’t looked at those pages, and may never, but the act of getting it on the page helped me feel calmer and clearer about another day at home during a pandemic.

Some of the writing activities were based on Story Quest, an initiative run by Stoke Reads and funded by Sport England that encourages families to explore their local areas by following a story trail packed with local facts, history and physical challenges.\\nThe response from local schools was really positive. A teacher from Belgrave Saint Bartholomew’s Academy, who sent her class home with the packs at the end of term, said:\\n“Our children were so excited to receive them and couldn’t wait to get started at home. They were such a massive support in allowing the children to develop their reading and writing skills over the summer break!”.\\n\\xa0\\nProviding important support during lockdown\\nThe National Literacy Trust released research on National Writing Day (24 June 2020) showing that writing helped children and young people process and cope with feelings of worry, anxiety and uncertainty around the coronavirus pandemic. Over 2 in 5 (41%) children and young people said that writing makes them feel better and 1 in 4 (25%) said that writing helps them when they feel sad that they can’t see friends and family. Many children and young people attributed this rise to lockdown providing them with the inspiration and conditions they need to write more creatively, such as having more time and space to think and generate ideas.\\nSince lockdown restrictions limited families’ access to these outdoor spaces, the Stoke Reads team swiftly adapted delivery and created a series of indoor Story Quest challenges that families could do in their own home.

SIE already plays a critical national role in this ecosystem through empowering innovative students of any discipline to start tech-enabled businesses. \\nFiona Godsman, chief executive at Scottish Institute for Enterprise, said: “SIE wholly welcomes the recommendations as set out in the report and we agree that we must build on our current tech ecosystem. \\n“Whilst the tech sector is important it is also important to recognise that Scotland has excellence across a diverse range of entrepreneurs and all start-up ventures can be harnessed in a bid to aid Scotland’s economic recovery. Tech, whilst seen by many as a standalone sector, now underpins every industry – whether that’s beauty, agriculture or engineering – and this will become even more apparent in the years ahead.”\\nFunding, education and infrastructure have already been earmarked as the three pillars to influence the performance of the ecosystem as proposed by Logan. With education at the heart, SIE has called for more emphasis to be put on the role that universities and colleges have to play as catalysts for and facilitators of economic recovery. The early instilling of an enterprising mindset in students of all disciplines is foundational for an entrepreneurial economy. \\nThe report suggests that the output of the new technology ecosystem should be a stream of technology start-ups that reach sustained profitability, including a significant proportion that do so at scale with consequential benefits in opportunity for our people, in job creation and in tax revenues.\\nFiona Godsman continued: “In order to achieve this output we should recognise the importance of multidisciplinary start-up ventures – innovative ideas come from a wide range of disciplines and having that diversity of thinking is absolutely crucial in growing the flow of students into the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Whilst technology and computing skills will be vital to economic recovery, we must pair such skills alongside others for Scotland to successfully achieve a robust economic recovery. \\n“Across the nation through our universities and colleges, we already have access to budding entrepreneurs which is a result of the institutes taking a proactive approach to integrating innovative and enterprise thinking within the curriculum. This, in my opinion, is the stage that we need to capitalise on now and into which additional investment should be focused.”\\nBy supporting education bodies and institutes across Scotland, SIE has enabled hundreds of students to accelerate start-up ventures including former Dundee University medical student, Chris McCann. His tech business, Current Health which provides a digital platform for medical staff to monitor patient health, was nurtured through the specialist support available collectively through SIE and the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem, and has gone on to achieve remarkable success across the globe. \\nUniversity of Strathclyde alumni, Rebecca Pick, founded Pick Protection which develops ground-breaking solutions for lone worker and employee protection and received support from SIE when starting her business. \\nRebecca commented: “Scotland already has a fantastic range of resources, support and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs and students alike who have innovative ideas that need nurtured. There’s a pool of talent awaiting to be unlocked across the country and ensuring that even more students can access the existing range of support will accelerate our economic recovery.”\\nMany of the recommendations being put forward in the report are already underway in Scotland, particularly on the education front, so creating new platforms may not be necessary. Instead, SIE suggests that we should harness and amplify the progress that is already being made. \\nFiona concluded: “Vital to enabling the technology ecosystem, as coined in the report, is working together with decision-makers, education bodies and importantly, students. The report shines a light on the potential we have here in Scotland to create a future-proofed economy and with the right investment, time and understanding as suggested within the recommendations, collectively we’ll deliver a strong economic recovery.”',\n"," 'Gillian Keegan, apprenticeship and skills minister, announced yesterday that a Statutory Instrument had been laid out in parliament to allow the\\xa0Education\\xa0and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) to continue to fund apprentices to complete their training if they are at least 75 per cent of the way through their programme at the point of redundancy.\\nThe HomeServe Foundation, a not-for-profit arm of leading home repairs company HomeServe Plc, is launching later this month with the goal of dramatically increasing the number of apprentices in the UK by supporting employers to take on and train more apprentices.\\nIn reaction to this announcement, Helen Booth, Director of HomeServe Foundation said:\\n“Businesses across the UK have faced an incredibly challenging period through the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the Brexit deadline looming the future is still very uncertain for so many.\\n“Without doubt, apprentices have been some of the worst hit during the pandemic, with many unable to complete their training through no fault of their own.

Little London Community Primary School has taken the bold step of ensuring these children will have their own Google Chromebook and internet access so they are covered for every eventuality.\\nThe scheme is the brainchild of Jill Wood, head teacher at Little London Community Primary School, who recognised that a ground-breaking solution was needed post-lockdown. Little London is an inner-city school of 630 children, where the proportion of disadvantaged pupils is much higher than the national average. Pupils have extremely limited access to technology and the internet outside school. A quarter of families have either no internet access, or limited access through a mobile phone, making home learning impossible.\\nLittle London Community Primary School has taken delivery of new Chrome Books for their pupils.Pictured are some of the pupils with headteacher Jill Wood and Steven Lightfoot of Next Generation IT.\\nJill enrolled the help of local IT provider, Next Generation IT, along with Google\\xa0Education\\xa0to provide a ground-breaking solution. Next Generation IT will begin the Google Chromebook rollout for pupils this month. Secure filtered Internet access will be provided to the 150 families currently without. Each family will receive a 4G router with pre-loaded data which will only work with the managed Chromebook supplied.\\nJill Wood, head teacher at Little London Community Primary School, said: “We knew we had to deliver a bold solution to ensure that all pupils have access to learning. The return of pupils in September was never going to be straightforward however we have prepared for every eventuality by providing technology that will help all pupils reach their potential.\\n“Our teachers have done an amazing job of producing top quality lessons that can be delivered online, but children need to be able to access them. We needed to make sure children had their own device that was safe and used purely for\\xa0education\\xa0and Steven from Next Generation IT has come up with the perfect solution. The Governors have been extremely supportive of the project and are devoted to ensuring learning for the future. The Chromebooks can be used at home and at school and we see them as an essential tool for learning.”\\nThe school has worked with Next Generation IT for over 15 years and has recently opted for Google Classrooms to be setup through DfE grant funding. This made the Google Chromebook solution the natural choice for the school, with an easy roll out solution for all students, allowing safe and secure access to learning. The Google Chromebook project is being funded by the school.\\nSteven Lightfoot, director of Next Generation IT, said: “Jill Wood is a true visionary and it has been amazing to work with her on this project.

Teachers help us pass on information from our past onto future generations. They offer guidance on all levels, from teaching the ABCs to explaining rocket science. Teachers aren’t as well compensated as some other professions, even though most professionals have to pass through their hands. If you are considering becoming a teacher, this guide is for you. Here are a few steps to follow.\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Be Absolutely Sure You Want to Teach\\nWhy do you want to be a teacher? There are a few questions to ask to help you evaluate this:\\n\\nDo you have the desire? It will help you hang on when things get tough.\\nCan you complete the requirements? There are some prerequisites that need to be met, like earning a degree and a teaching license.\\nAre you okay with the salary? Though the salary varies depending on various factors, it is lower than some other professions, and you need to be okay with that.\\nDo you have the necessary skills and talent? You need patience, charisma, willingness, and strictness, to name a few qualities.\\n\\nOne way you can be sure is to gain prior experience. You can do this by volunteering, shadowing teachers, or becoming a substitute. You will experience firsthand how it is to be in the teaching environment. One great thing about teaching is job satisfaction. Seeing your students better at the end of the school year than they were at the beginning is a great motivator.\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Determine What You Want to Teach\\nThis is a two-fold point. First, you need to determine what age you want to teach. Secondly, you may also need to decide which subject you want to teach. Pre-school and elementary teachers have a broader curriculum. Teachers for these levels need to be knowledgeable in many disciplines. Teachers for older students like from middle school onwards can specialize in specific subjects. There is also the option of specializing in special needs education. Here, you will teach children with disabilities and developmental disorders. For special education, teaching does not follow age but knowledge base.\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Settle on How You Will Gain the Training\\nEvery district has specific requirements they require their teachers to meet. Be sure to know what the prerequisites are. There are four key training options to consider:\\na.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 University-Based Training\\nThis option means you go to school first, obtain the certificate then start teaching. Many districts require the teachers to have experience before they are licensed. Some teaching programs incorporate a teacher preparation program to help teachers gain this experience. This option may mean that you are in school for longer before you start teaching. University-based training can be expensive, so you may need to consider payment options like getting a scholarship or applying for financial aid.\\nb.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Teach First\\nThe goal of Teach First is to eradicate educational inequality. They place top graduates in challenging schools for two years minimum. After a brief residential program, you begin teaching and earning immediately. This is a good option for those who want to start teaching quickly. It is also great for those who feel they may not be able to afford a university or college tuition. What’s more, you gain experience on the job eliminating the need for a preparatory program.\\nc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 School Direct\\nThis is a great middle point between university training and Teach First. You start teaching in a single school immediately and attend school once a week. You have the option of paying for the university tuition or getting paid by the school. The choice available to you will depend on your experience level.\\nd.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 School Centered Initial Teacher Training (SCITT)\\nIn this case, you will approach a school directly and train with partnered institutions. SCITT is not as common as Teach First and School Direct. You usually need a pre-existing relationship with the school you approach.\\nThere are some common things every teacher must learn. They include:\\n\\nPsychology\\nTeaching methodologies\\nSpecial education\\nCurriculum and instructional designs\\nHow to assess students\\n\\nPlatforms like\\xa0essayservice\\xa0can help you with crafting reports and essays to meet your coursework requirements.\\n4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Get a Teaching License\\nYou won’t always start teaching immediately you finish your training. Some schools and districts have to test you before giving you a teaching license. You may have to do some assessment tests like Praxis. Some students do this alongside their training so that they start teaching immediately.\\nConclusion\\nOnce you have met the necessary prerequisites, you can start looking for a job. Look for guides on how to draft good resumes and cover letters. Learn about how to conduct yourself at interviews. Finally, search for job vacancies. You can look through generalized boards, niche job boards, or specific school and district websites. When you get that job, do your best. Besides bringing up great future professionals, you may inspire some of your students to become teachers later on.',\n"," 'Sarwar Khawaja\\nIn 2017, Sarwar Khawaja received the Brian Tracy International Excellence Award for services in education & research. The renowned Tracy presented Khawaja with the award at a business event in London. One thing both Tracy and Khawaja understand is the importance of motivation and inspiration when it comes to education and business. Here are 5 ways to motivate yourself, and to stay motivated, when learning and working.\\n1) Create Goals\\nThe former American football player Lou Holtz once said that “If you’re bored with life – you don’t get up every morning with a burning desire to do things – you don’t have enough goals.” Goals aren’t just something to aim for, they’re also ways in which to measure your accomplishments. Whether you start out with small, manageable goals or aim for larger, more ambitious aspirations, goals help to locate where you are and what you need to do to achieve your dreams.\\n2) Celebrate Successes\\nHowever small the success, make sure you celebrate. Success could be as simple as getting through a difficult day, or completing a particularly challenging task. Reward yourself for those successes, as they’ll help you to progress. By celebrating your accomplishments, the road you’re taking towards your goals will be much easier to walk, and you’ll have more to motivate you along the journey.\\n3) Assess your Goals\\nSometimes, it’s important to review your goals in order to understand if they’re still the right goals for you. During the course of your education or work, you may find your goals have changed, at which point you’ll need to revise those aspirations in order to stay motivated. If you feel your motivation to achieve is waning, it could be time to re-evaluate to ensure you don’t lose momentum. Reviewing and amending your goals is a positive sign that you’re able to focus on the correct destination.\\n4) Consider Deadlines\\nBenjamin Franklin once made the prescient point that “You may delay, but time will not.” Procrastination is an issue for all workers and students – it’s human nature. But in order to overcome that issue of time, it’s good practice to create deadlines that you can stick to in order to ensure you don’t lose track of your aims. However, make sure they’re achievable deadlines, and do give yourself time to rest and relax.\\n5) Be Optimistic\\nIt’s not an easy concept to advise someone to be optimistic, but being positive is a key way of maintaining focus. Sometimes, positivity can be accomplished through sheer will – focus on what benefits achieving your goals will bring you, and understand how success will improve your life. Other times, you may need to work to feel positive. This may involve taking a little time off to do something you enjoy, or focusing on things you know to bring you a sense of peace and happiness. Colin Powell once described “Perpetual optimism” as a “Force multiplier”. Where you can, harness optimism to help give you the extra energy and motivation to move forward.',\n"," 'Fimatix has launched a track and trace kit developed especially for schools, in time for the start of the autumn term.

Shield for Schools will be available to roll out to other interested schools across the UK and around the world.\\nTim Howarth, Managing Director for Financial Services, at Fimatix said: “We created Shield for Schools to play a positive role in the management of risk and to give pupils, families and schools additional reassurance and peace of mind during these challenging times. By allowing real time contact tracing of the entire school community, we’re helping to ensure that everything possible is being done to make the most of a COVID-19 free learning environment.”\\nKevin Samson from Buckswood commented: “We believe that this technology provides a key component in our school’s ability to manage Covid-19, enabling us as a school to instantly identify and isolate students who have been in close contact with anyone who tests positive. Additionally, Shield for Schools is an extremely useful tool in being able to quickly provide important information to Public Health England and the NHS should there be a need to track and trace individuals outside of our school community. It allows us to minimise wider isolation of staff and students, thus minimising the impact on education for all whilst at the same time providing an extra layer of reassurance for parents.”\\nMark Taylor, Executive Director of Taylor Education, who are closely involved in Shield for Schools, added: “We have worked in partnership with independent schools over the last 10 years – assisting in their strategic planning. This is certainly the most challenging time schools have ever experienced. Working with the Boarding School’s Association, independent schools have developed policies and procedures that can give students, parents and staff confidence that independent schools are doing everything possible. A robust strategy of testing for the virus coupled with Fimatix’s track and trace Shield for Schools, complements and builds on the BSA guidance and allows schools to demonstrate that they are creating the most virus free learning environments possible. By introducing the track and trace systems, schools are given the edge in making risk based decisions, based on clinical assessment.”\\nWith students, teachers and staff wearing Bluetooth wristbands from the first day of term, and having been trained on the new system, Shield for Schools follows three steps. Should a student or member of staff report feeling ill or have positive COVID-19 test results, the system administrator will be notified, log the data and the individual will be isolated as part of the first step. Step two involves cross checking the wristband ID with other wristband IDs on the Shield for Schools dashboard. The school will then perform isolation, retesting and safety protocols as part of the third step, helping to protect the wider school community and minimise disruption to learning.\\nThe Shield for Schools algorithm is designed by medical experts to comply with latest Public Health England guidance on social distancing and contagion prevention and only the schools themselves will have access to, and manage, data relating to pupils and staff.\\nWhile the first phase of Shield for Schools is being implemented in leading UK independent boarding schools, the system is also being made available to other interested schools. Fimatix are also implementing bespoke test, track and trace solutions for businesses and workplaces looking for additional reassurance and risk management as teams return to work in offices.\\nFimatix is a leading Fintech and Govtech business. With a team of over 150 staff, partners and associates, Fimatix Group’s purpose is to enhance the productivity of business, governments and organisations to the benefit of economies, communities and people around the world.\\nFor further information please contact:\\nFran O’Leary: 07980 582 254; f.ol@lodestonecommunications.com\\nhttps://www.fimatix.com/',\n"," 'A leading suicide prevention charity has launched a new campaign urging young people to face up to their feelings of desperation and get help.\\nPAPYRUS Prevention of Young Suicide says a happy, confident smile may mask true feelings of anxiety and fear.\\nThe charity hopes its high-impact campaign will provoke a response among young people and others who are concerned for someone who may be having thoughts of suicide.\\nGed Flynn, Chief Executive of PAPYRUS, said: “There is much debate about face masks just now. For some, masks are seen as protective; for others, masks are an obstacle or a barrier.\\n“Young people often find it difficult to express their emotions, especially when their circumstances change. Lockdown is a good example of how a sudden change can have a huge impact on young people. Staying at home, working or learning in a new environment, having less privacy and having less access to friends, families and colleagues, all mitigate against feeling safe and emotionally well.\\n“I would urge us all to help young people navigate the new normal and not to wait for them to struggle or suffer. We all need to find new ways of enabling our young people to be themselves, to express themselves, to share their challenges as well as their achievements.\\n“Children and young people are often grieving, reacting to the losses which come with change. We need to help them learn how to live through these difficult times. PAPYRUS is here to support you and them to enable life, however difficult this can be just now, and ultimately to prevent harm and death.\\n“There are many hidden faces of despair out there and they need to know there is someone to talk to and that help is available.”\\nHOPELINEUK is the charity’s confidential helpline service which is staffed by trained professionals. Practical advice and support is available by ringing 0800 068 4141, texting 07860 039967 or by email to pat@papyrus-uk.org.\\nThe artwork for the PAPYRUS campaign was created by the award-winning agency TBWA Manchester. Gary Fawcette, Executive Creative Director, said: “At a time when it has never been more important to wear a mask and particularly when more people than ever are possibly struggling with their mental health, these images will hopefully remind people to keep talking.”\\nIn 2017 PAPYRUS and TBWA collaborated on the award-winning social media campaign #BraveFace, which contained similar messaging around suicide, openness and young people helping one another.\\nPAPYRUS says these and a number of other hard-hitting campaigns play an important role in supporting young people, engaging and equipping local communities and helping to shape suicide prevention strategies.\\n“Ged Flynn from PAPYRUS added: “If you are a young person who is struggling and not showing how you really feel, don’t suffer in silence. Please talk to us.\\n“If you are a parent who is worried about your child, or you are concerned about someone else who could be thinking of taking their own life, look closely and reach out to them before it’s too late.”\\nSuicide is the biggest killer of young people in the UK. PAPYRUS aims to reduce the number of young people who take their own lives by breaking down the stigma around suicide and equipping people with the skills to recognise and respond to suicidal behaviour.',\n"," 'As schools prepare to reopen, many teachers are apprehensive about how many students will actually be returning.\\nAfter all, many parents are uneasy about sending their kids back to school, and this might make your preparations difficult.\\nWhile keeping kids at home might seem like a viable option for many parents, homeschooling could leave them behind and mean that they struggle to achieve the qualifications that they need to succeed in the future.\\nAs such, you should work with parents to help them understand that your school is doing its best to keep their precious children safe. Here are some handy tips to help you encourage parents to send their children back to school next term.\\nAsk For Feedback\\nYour school will never be able to meet parents’ expectations if it doesn’t know what they are. As such, you should communicate with parents to find out what they want your school to do to keep their children safe, and then see how viable each solution is so that you can implement as many as possible. If parents are making unreasonable demands based on false information, then communicate with them and inform them of the truth about the virus and how it spreads.\\nWork With A Professional Cleaning Company\\nShow parents that you are committed to keeping your school clean and safe for their children by working with a professional cleaning company. Ideal Cleaning specializes in commercial cleaning and works with a wide range of schools and education providers, so the team can offer a tailored solution that meets your needs and ensures that your school is clean and safe in time for the new term and that it stays that way.\\nFollow Government Advice To The Letter\\nMany parents are turning to the government for advice and information, so make sure that your school follows government guidelines and abides by every regulation. It can be confusing when the government makes contradictory statements but do your best to interpret their information correctly and make the best possible decisions for your students and staff.\\nInstall Hand Sanitizer Stations Throughout Your School \\nAs the virus is transmitted through water droplets, touching your face and skin can help the virus to spread. The best way to reduce the spread is to keep your hands clean and avoid touching your face, but this can be tough for kids, especially young ones. Install hand sanitizer stations throughout your school so that they can always keep their hands clean and reduce the spread of the virus.\\nEmbrace Technology\\nShared textbooks and printed handouts could harbour germs and be unsafe, so instead embrace technology. Consider installing projects in every classroom, so that teachers can show the entire class visual resources that they can’t touch. This approach will save your school a lot of wastage and money, as well as making it safer for children and teachers alike. Check out projectors that use remote controls, so that staff don’t have to touch as many surfaces',\n"," 'Today the Department for Education has published guidance to support colleges to fully reopen in September. Responding to the announcement by the Education Secretary, Chief Executive of the Association of Colleges, David Hughes said:\\xa0“Since the outbreak of COVID19, colleges have been pragmatic and acted swiftly to protect student safety, whilst also protecting their continued access to learning and training. Students should be confident that they will continue to receive a high quality education with great pastoral support as colleges continue to increase the numbers of students able to return to their sites.\\n“This guidance offers some clarity to college leaders and staff planning for the safe reopening of their building and campuses in September, but they should continue to make their decisions based on health and safety advice and their local context.\\n“There is no doubt that much of the teaching in colleges will need to be a blend of online and on-campus delivery, and colleges have learned a lot about how that mix can work best for different groups of students. Colleges will all be facing different challenges in September and will know what works best for them in regards to the amount of teaching and learning to keep online and the students or provision that have an urgent need for face-to-face delivery.\\n“It is right that the government has focused on getting young people back into education and training as quickly as possible, but there remains a gap that needs to be plugged. Students leaving school face an uphill challenge to get back on track with their learning, colleges are preparing to help them as much as they can but they need the same catch up support that have been given to their peers in schools. Anything less is indefensible.\\n“Government must also look urgently into how they safely bring adults back into education and training. It cannot be right that an adult can now go to the pub with their mates, but they cannot undertake an assessment to complete their construction course, even when things have been put in place to make it safe to do so.\\n“Colleges are working extremely hard to ensure they are ready to offer the best experience to their new and returning students. There are still questions that will need clarification ahead of September, including around transport, minimising contact and mixing and for students with a work experience or placement element to their studies. They also need to clarify funding rules that will allow colleges to deliver all that is being asked.\\n“AoC will continue to work with officials to ensure students and staff can transition back into colleges safely when the new term arrives.”',\n"," 'Clinical psychologist Dr Asha Patel (left) of the multi award-winning social enterprise Innovating Minds is running a series of webinars on essential mental health topics and is partnering with author Jane Evans to create The Healing Together Facilitator Programme.\\nThe course is aimed at those who work with children at both primary and secondary schools or in other community settings.

She’s also the author of a number of books to which help adults explore discuss difficult issues with children including one on domestic abuse called How Are You Feeling Today Baby Bear?\\nInnovating Minds, based in Birmingham, is a not for profit which has consistently provided support and funding for children who have witnessed domestic abuse. Asha Patel believes that there will be a tsunami of referrals to statutory mental health services once lockdown finishes and waiting lists will spiral out of control.\\nThe course will upskill schools, social workers, early help workers and community organisations to deliver support to children impacted by domestic abuse.\\n‘Early intervention is crucial to a child’s emotional wellbeing and education.’ said Asha. ”This course will enable children to access therapeutic help from people they trust, in a space where they feel safe. This is a unique programme as every aspect (videos, worksheets, training) has been developed through a trauma informed lens. Experience has shown us at Innovating Minds that this is the best strategy, as children need to connect with their bodies and feelings to aid their journey to recovery.’\\nMore details about the Healing Together programme can be found here: https://www.innovatingmindscic.com/children-impacted-domestic-abuse',\n"," 'Perhaps not surprisingly, one of the side effects of lockdown has been the huge pressure on the mental health of our children. Charities like the NSPCC and its Childline service have counselled thousands of children struggling to cope with the current situation. At the same time, schools are trying to find ways to help children continue their learning whilst at home. An unlikely celebrity pairing and a new initiative with a friendly fox at the helm should help with both issues.\\nBest known for his 17 years hosting BBC TV property auction show Homes under the Hammer, Martin Roberts is also an established children’s book author.\\nMartin has enlisted the support of legendary children’s entertainer and all round good fox, Basil Brush, to create a charming narrated and partially animated version of Sadsville, a magical and whimsical illustrated book from his ‘Herman and the Magical Bus to The Villes’ series. The recording has just been released on YouTube for general viewing, and is also being sent out with an accompanying home study pack FREE to all primary schools in the UK, with a view to them passing it on to their pupils.\\nRoberts wrote Sadsville in support of the invaluable work of the NSPCC and Childline. It contains an emotional well-being self-help guide and details of how to contact Childline. It forms part of the campaign to help children’s mental well-being that is the mainstay of the author’s own charity The Martin Roberts Foundation (reg no 1172905) which aims to give a free copy of the physical book to every child in year 4 (8 & 9 year olds) in the UK. So far over 30,000 books have been distributed, with more to come.\\nPeter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC says: “Currently, we are hearing from children in their thousands who have been cut off from vital support networks such as school and friends, and that has increased their feelings of loneliness and vulnerability. However, there are many more out there who are suffering in silence, which is why we are doing all we can to let children know we are still here for them.\\n“Using Basil Brush to narrate Sadsville is a unique and entertaining approach to letting even more children know how they can contact Childline if things are tough, and I am confident it will be very successful.”\\nMartin Roberts comments: “I have my own kids aged 10 and 13 so I understand the pressures that lockdown has put on young people.\\n“The Villes is a series of magical and whimsical books aimed at children aged 6 to 10. In Windyville it’s always windy, in Tiredsville everyone is always tired, in Latesville everyone is always late, in Sadsville everyone is always sad… and so on… and the reader has to work out why.\\n“The books in general encourage problem solving and fire the imagination in readers of all ages. Sadsville in particular encourages children to question their own emotions and ‘think outside the box’ as to why they may be struggling with unhappiness. It helps them find ways to feel happier and to reach out for support if they need it.”\\nBasil Brush says: “It was a booming pleasure to be part of Mr Martin’s wonderful book, to read his lovely story and help the NSPCC and their Childline service at the same time. The illustrations are perfect, but for some reason I felt peckish at the end – you’ll know why when you read it.

However, these industries have been in a steady decline. Hence the reason why it is reported that those living in coastal regions of the UK earn £1,600 less on average per year than those in inland communities.\\nDespite the doom and gloom around seafaring jobs in Hull, the local industry has managed to reinvent itself into an epicentre for engineering, manufacturing and healthcare. Smith & Nephew, Seven Seas and BP are all major employers in the area today – and they are continually looking for the best graduate talent.\\nWhere to Work in Hull after Graduation?\\nIf you have recently graduated from the University of Hull or are a returning graduate to the area, you may be wondering what opportunities you can find in Hull. These opportunities have grown recently with plenty of new graduate jobs up for grabs. You can find these directly on employer sites or by searching for jobs in Hull on JobRapido.\\nSome great examples of graduate employers in Hull include:\\n\\nThe University of Hull: You can take up further study to earn a doctorate, research fellowship, or start working in the teams behind the scenes at the university.\\nHull City Council: Work in the public sector on environmental programmes as well as housing or IT jobs.\\nBAE Systems: Get into a manufacturing, engineering or marketing graduate job here.\\nBP: Newly graduated engineers may be interested in working for BP and their exciting projects.\\nAssociated British Ports: Just because seafaring jobs have declined does not mean they are dead. The industry still needs fresh-faced grads to keep the industry afloat.\\n\\nMany of these companies have added automation to recruitment processes. So if you do apply, you are likely to find out if you have been successful quicker!\\nHull’s Growing Industries\\nHull has moved away from its maritime reputation, but just like any other location, it cannot cater to all graduates of different disciplines. Hull’s new-look job market is geared towards engineering and manufacturing, with some emphasis on healthcare and chemical engineering. These are complex and rewarding professions, meaning the pay for these jobs is usually lucrative.\\nAlong with these types of roles, Hull also has a place for those working in sales and marketing. After all, these manufacturing companies also need other departments to complete their processes and operations.

After her final rotation was cancelled due to the Coronavirus outbreak, Pavanjit’s portfolio will be signed off two months early, and she credited Sandwell College for giving her many of the skills that have helped her work through the challenging conditions.\\nPavanjit commented: “There has been a lot of uncertainty over the last couple of months, however I’ve found that being able to quickly adapt is crucial – particularly as new medicine is always changing. Looking back, my time at college definitely shaped my skills and lay the foundations for me to become a more resilient person, which has been hugely important when coping with the recent events.”\\nGraham Pennington, Principal\\xa0of Sandwell College, commented: “We’re extremely proud to see how our former students are contributing to the response against Coronavirus, and want to let them know how grateful we are for their services.\\n“Sandwell College is an active member within the local community, and we want our rainbow to build a sense of togetherness and hope for anyone who sees it over the coming weeks.

Ensuring that the school is capable of accommodating the new influx of pupils is paramount to ensuring a safe and comfortable training environment for all.\\nSchools that are looking to improve, extend or build new classrooms and educational facilities are turning, more and more, to modular construction; not just for temporary classroom use, whilst the facility is being built, but for the actual permanent building too.\\nModular buildings have recently hit the headlines as hospitals around the UK have utilised this method of off-site construction to quickly erect safe and secure centres for hospital staff to work in and test for Covid-19. The method of building inside a facility before erecting the building on-site cuts down on-site construction time considerably which is why the healthcare industry is actively looking at modular construction over its traditional brick-built counterpart.\\nFor a long time, modular buildings, also known as prefabricated buildings, have been mistaken for nothing more than a cabin or basic shell of a building. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Modular school buildings can be externally designed using thermowood cladding, triple-glazed glass and uPVC fascias whilst the buildings themselves can accommodate all the facilities your school may require, from laboratories to canteens and everything in-between, with plumbing, electrics and IT infrastructure installed.\\nCotaplan, one of the leading modular building companies in the UK, were the first to meet the strict, eco-friendly and environmentally efficient Passivhaus Passivclass standards in the UK with the construction of Smallwood Primary School in South West London. Their efforts have seen them construct other Passivhaus builds, such as the sensory education facilities at Linden Lodge in Wimbledon, as well as other standard, bespoke modular builds for nurseries and schools across the UK. With modular construction a fraction of the cost of traditional builds, and with a shorter time to completion date, it’s no wonder that the education sector is moving towards this more efficient method of construction.',\n"," 'Responding to last night’s statement from the Prime Minister, Dr Patrick Roach, General Secretary of the NASUWT – The Teachers’ Union, said:\\n“The Prime Minister’s statement that it would be “madness” to risk a second spike in transmission of the Coronavirus highlights the need for extreme caution. Regrettably, the Prime Minister’s announcement is likely to provoke confusion and does not address the genuine concerns that have been raised by teachers.\\n“The Prime Minister’s announcement lacks the clarity of statements issued by Ministers in Scotland and Wales who have reaffirmed the key ‘stay at home’ message. The Government’s announcement that schools in England might reopen to more children from 1 June risks thousands of schools rushing to make decisions about how best to safeguard the health and safety of children and staff in the absence of any clear national guidance.\\n“It is baffling that following the Government’s decision to close all schools on public health grounds that the Government now expects individual schools to work out for themselves whether or not it will be safe to reopen on 1 June and potentially put at risk the health of children, staff and the public. With no date yet set for when the Government’s guidance will be forthcoming, school leaders in England are being placed in an extremely difficult position of being asked to draw up plans affecting lives of children and their teachers.\\n“These announcements will do little to assuage teachers’ concerns about the premature reopening of schools. The Government must with the utmost urgency address teachers’ concerns or expect to lose the goodwill of the profession. Unless and until the Government can demonstrate that schools will be safe for staff and children, all schools should continue to limit their opening only to vulnerable children and to children of key workers.\\n“The NASUWT will continue to press the Government on the need for clear guidance and stringent and enforceable health and safety risk assessment measures to be in place in every school prior to relaxing the current restrictions. The UK Government’s message to be responsible and to ‘stay alert’ will ring hollow with teachers who are still being denied access to appropriate PPE and who have been given no clear guidance about how social distancing can be practiced in school settings.\\n“Notwithstanding the Government’s five tests, the bottom line is that no teacher or child should be expected to go into schools until it can be demonstrated that it is safe for them to do so.”',\n"," '– Supporting UK families to homeschool with confidence during COVID-19 –\\nIn response to the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, ClickView, the world’s leading producer of educational videos, is taking action.

Exercise isn’t just good for your physical fitness; it can also have an impact on your mental wellbeing, so it’s important to find alternative ways to stay active. There are lots of ways to create an active work environment that keeps you moving throughout the day. Here are some simple tips from AJ Products to help you to keep fit while working from home.\\n\\nGo for a walk or run.\\nMake the most of the fact that you are allowed to get outside for daily exercise and try to go out every day no matter your fitness levels. Fresh air and a change of scenery will be good for both your physical and mental health. Make sure you follow all government guidelines and stay a safe two metres away from anyone not in your household.\\nJoin in with a fitness video or online class\\nThere are lots of workout videos available for free online as well as live online classes. One of the biggest benefits to working from home is that you can grab a quick shower after your workout and, unless you’re not on a video call, no-one will know if you wear your gym clothes to work!\\n\\n\\nStand up to work\\nStanding at your desk is an easy and effective way to start moving more while you work. A sit-stand desk lets you sit for part of the day and then stand for part of it, making it easy for you to switch between the two. Being able to vary your position as you work can make a big difference to your overall wellbeing; standing has been shown to burn extra calories compared to sitting and helps break the dangerous cycle of too much sitting.\\n\\n\\nTry an active sitting chair\\nAn exercise ball chair is a great way to combine your work with a workout. It forces you to work your core muscles to keep yourself upright and counteract the natural movement of the ball. Improve your fitness further by doing simple Pilates chair exercises.\\n\\n\\nDo a mini workout\\nStaying active can be as simple as incorporating basic exercises into your daily routine, such as sitting down and standing up ten times in a row or doing jumping jacks a few times each morning and afternoon.\\n\\n\\nWalk and work\\nTake a walk around the house at regular intervals. For example, you could make it a rule to always walk around while taking phone calls.\\n\\n\\nRun up and down the stairs\\nIf you have stairs, run or walk up and down a few times a day. It’s an easy way to get extra steps in and get your heart rate up.\\nGet on your bike\\nIf you have an exercise bike at home, take a 10 minute break from your work a few times a day to get your heart rate up. Short bursts of high-intensity activity will get your blood pumping and burn body fat.\\n\\nTaking short breaks to get your body moving is not only good for your health, it can also help you focus better when you get back to work. Aerobic workouts can help improve memory, lower stress levels and give you more energy. Remember to look after your body in other ways too: eat healthily, stay hydrated and make sure you get enough sleep.\\n\\xa0\\nAJ Products is a supplier of workplace furniture and interior solutions that focuses on ways to solve the problem of a sedentary workday.

But what does automation mean for recruitment? From targeted ads, CV scanners, application trackers, and psychometric testing, there is a lot technology can do to make the hiring process less painful for both recruiters and applicants.\\nIt’s now estimated that 75% of recruiters surveyed now use some sort of recruitment software and 94% of them say it has improved their hiring process. Here’s just some of the ways that automation can benefit recruitment and make finding the perfect job a bit easier.\\nReducing Costs\\nWith costs estimated at 7k to 30k for making a hire, automation is being frequently used to save money. Technology is quicker, more accurate, and doesn’t take a break, so once it is programmed to do what is needed, it is much more efficient than people. This isn’t to say that the goal is to remove human recruiters because there will always be a need for person-to-person contact when hiring someone, especially when working within a team. However, automation makes recruiters’ lives a lot easier: they can work faster, have more data to work with, and can spend more time focusing on the right candidates instead of sorting through unsuitable CVs.\\nAutomation also cuts costs in ways that can have long-term effects, making it even more valuable to use in the first place. If the hiring process is quicker and the candidates are better suited, then job satisfaction for recruiters and their new hires will increase. This means that employee retention can become higher and creates a better culture within the company, as well as reducing the costs that come with high staff turnover.\\nSmarter, Faster \\n\\xa0One of the biggest benefits of automation in recruitment is the time saved. By getting technology to do the mundane and time-consuming tasks such as pre-screening, hiring staff can work through more candidates faster and without the information overload that is so common nowadays. While the internet means that job postings can be seen by thousands of people everyday, it also means that application numbers have sky-rocketed but in reality, only 2% of job applicants get interviews. By using automation to identify the best candidates, an enormous amount of time can be saved – both for employers and potential employees.\\nPre-screening software can also reach out to successful and unsuccessful candidates as soon as the decision has been made, building relationships quicker than with a manual process, which can lead to a more satisfying job search. It is also more effective at storing information, meaning that when strong candidates aren’t chosen this time, they can be easily reconsidered for another position when it comes along. This builds a connection with candidates and a better brand for the company, which in turn encourages passive applicants to become active and answer the job adverts put out.\\nBetter Reach\\nThere’s a lot of information out there, so job adverts can get easily lost in the traditional spaces, and with low unemployment rates there is a good chance that a great candidate for the position is only passively looking for another job. This means they’re not scrolling through job listings for hours, but they’re open to a new opportunity should it make itself available. Around 98% of recruiters use LinkedIn and other social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook are becoming the go-to places to find jobs. Since these sites collect a huge amount of data from their users, their targeted advertising algorithms are pretty accurate and can help put adverts where they are more effective.\\nThis is where programmatic job advertising comes in. All recruiters need to do is input their parameters and needs into the software, e.g. the budget for advertisements, number of applicants wanted, and what the target demographic is, then the computer does the hard work. Adverts pop up across the web, tracking down sites that may be niche, but the people that visit them may better match the demographic for those likely to be qualified for the job. This is like a web-wide targeted ad and companies have reported that using these softwares has reduced costs by 30-70% per qualified candidate.\\nEmbracing Automation\\nAutomation is changing every aspect of our lives, including the hiring process, so embracing technology and the benefits it can bring will help companies perform at their best in the modern age. Technology has made us more connected meaning that hiring has become more competitive for both candidates and employers. Companies like Picked \\xa0are using AI to improve the matching process. As AI software like Picked continues to improve, hiring can become faster, cheaper, more accurate, and even more human, removing the traditional grievances that job seeking brings. The more intuitive and efficient the recruitment process can be, the easier it is for both recruiters and candidates to show their strengths, so using automation can help everyone reach their full potential.',\n"," 'Nick Gibb, the schools minister, has today confirmed that pupils will receive A-level results on August 13th, and GCSE results on August 20th, going back on an earlier statement that the intention was for students to receive their grades “before the end of July”.\\nAs it now stands, the dates student will receive their grades are those which were in place before GCSEs and A-levels were cancelled for 2020.

Schools and colleges will be asked to provide both a centre grade in each subject for each student and a rank order of pupils within each grade. If pupils are not happy with the result predicted for them, they can of course sit the exam in the autumn or next summer. Therefore, the necessity for vigilant education still remains.\\nMyTutor – the UK’s leading online tutoring service – in a bid to support those working diligently on their studies at home, have launched a new, free Online School which is packed with help for GCSE students. The platform offers daily live group tutorials on key GCSE topics and new resources are added every day. Pre-recorded videos focussing on popular topics are also uploaded to MyTutor’s YouTube channel regularly, across a wide range of subjects, but are currently centred around the core subjects: Maths, the three Sciences and English.\\nNow more than ever it is essential to provide access to crucial resources for students looking to continue their education from home. While schools are shut and the COVID-19 pandemic continues, this platform will remain free to help students and support schools in their efforts to present the GCSE curriculums at home.\\nJames Grant\\xa0 – Co-founder of MyTutor – discusses the need for private firms such as MyTutor to help support the public sector during this time:\\n“Pupils working in isolation from home because of containment measures could face learning challenges at a critical period. Fortunately, online platforms can be accessed in a convenient and hygienic way across the UK. MyTutor are incredibly pleased to launch this new service for GCSE students, which we believe will be a vital resource for those looking to continue their studies from home.\\n“MyTutor has advocated the use of EdTech in the classroom for a long time, and now we have the chance to assist schools, teachers and pupils as they work from home. We want to ensure we support all children with their continued learning during this tricky time and so are delighted to be able to provide this valuable and easily-accessible platform for free.”',\n"," 'Ofqual has now set out details for schools, colleges, students, parents & carers on how GCSEs and A levels will be awarded following the cancellation of this year’s exams.\\nFor this summer’s awards, schools and colleges are being asked to provide centre assessment grades for their students. These should be fair, objective and carefully considered judgements of the grades schools and colleges believe their students would have been most likely to achieve if they had sat their exams, and should take into account the full range of available evidence.\\nSally Collier, Chief Regulator, Ofqual, said: “School or college based assessment already has an important role in many GCSEs, AS and A levels and in extraordinary circumstances such as these, schools and colleges are best placed to judge the likely performance of their students at the end of the course.\\n“We have worked closely with the teaching profession to ensure that what we are asking is both appropriate and manageable, so that everyone can have confidence in the approach. I would like to take this opportunity to thank teachers and school leaders for making this process work for students during these very challenging times.\\n“We have published a message to students to reassure them that we, and exam boards, will do everything we can to make sure that, as far as possible, grades are fair and that they are not disadvantaged in their progress to sixth form, college, university, apprenticeships, training or work because of these unprecedented conditions.”\\nExam boards will be contacting schools, colleges and other exam centres after Easter asking them to submit, by a deadline that will be no earlier than 29 May 2020, the following:\\n\\na centre assessment grade for every student in each of their subjects: that is, the grade they would be most likely to have achieved if they had sat their exams and completed any non-exam assessment. Judgements should balance different sources of evidence such as:\\n\\nclasswork\\nbookwork\\nany participation in performances in subjects such as music, drama or PE\\nany non-exam assessment – whether or not complete\\nthe results of any assignments or mock exams\\nprevious examination results – for example, for any re-sitting students or those with relevant AS qualifications\\nany other records of student performance over the course of study\\n\\n\\nthe rank order of students within each grade for each subject – for example, for all those students with a centre assessment grade of 5 in GCSE maths, a rank order where 1 is the most secure/highest attaining student, and so on. This information will be used in the statistical standardisation of centres’ judgements – allowing fine tuning of the standard applied across all schools and colleges\\na declaration from the Head of Centre making the submission\\n\\nTo make sure that grades are as fair as possible across schools and colleges, exam boards will put all centre assessment grades through a process of standardisation using a model being developed with Ofqual.\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcses-as-and-a-level-awarding-summer-2020',\n"," 'Disney Theatrical Productions is to offer free downloadable creative activities for educators and parents from their West End shows of The Lion King, Mary Poppins, Frozen and Aladdin.

One thing we do know is that schools will continue to educate our children and they will need the space in which to do so. Our bespoke design modular buildings provide inspiring additional spaces throughout education.\\nHowever, with most construction projects paused, there will be delays caused by problems in the supply chain, duty of care to construction workers, as well as operational issues in schools taking care of the children of key workers. The backlog created means that when we begin to return to normality the resurgence in demand placed on the construction industry will likely exceed its capacity.

The software has a market value of £600/year for a secondary school, and £350/year for a primary school, but it is being offered free of charge in a bid to transform the student safeguarding space moving forwards.\\nImpero Back:drop enables teachers and safeguarding staff to access a history for each student, including pastoral, child protection, behavioural concerns, or mental health needs, as well as first aid incidents, medical requirements and a log of medicine administration. The system highlights patterns and connects external agencies for a single comprehensive view that enables early interventions and can flag warning signs of serious concerns including suspected home abuse or suicide risk.\\nImpero has created options within the software to support reporting specifically related to the current outbreak of COVID-19. This update will allow schools to see at a glance whether a student has suspected symptoms, and to track the health of the student body as a whole.\\nJustin Reilly, former teacher and CEO of Impero says: “Across the country, more than half of schools are still using paper-based filing cabinet reporting systems. Having spent most of my career as a teacher or school advisor, I know how difficult and time-consuming these systems make it to access records, identify trends over time and intervene where necessary. For schools which rely on paper-based systems, in situations where they have to work remotely – as is now the case with COVID-19 – carrying out this activity becomes impossible. Safeguarding must not stop, just because of the pandemic.”\\n“Schools must be able to access records in cases where remote working is necessary”, continues Reilly. “The idea is to make the reporting of safeguarding concerns for schools across the UK as easy as possible. It’s not right that budget constraints mean some schools have inferior processes in place when it comes to student safeguarding. That is why we are launching this self-sign up system, completely free of charge for schools today, tomorrow and indefinitely.”\\nWhile schools remain closed the remote capabilities of the software will ensure that pupil records are kept up to date. Teachers carrying out safeguarding processes, such as home visits to children with child protection concerns can maintain reports in real-time so that no information gaps exist when schools return to normal.\\nImpero Back:drop is designed to be straightforward to use and quick to implement, so that schools can begin reporting almost immediately. The onboarding process is simple: schools create an account, and then import student and staff data using a CSV file. Depending on the amount of data being uploaded, most schools can be ready to go within half an hour.\\nThe software is managed using an intuitive web interface, and Impero is also making knowledge base articles available on their customer portal so that teachers and safeguarding teams can quickly get to grips with the software.\\nImpero Back:drop is available for free and schools can sign-up from today on the Impero website.',\n"," 'Laminate flooring is required for households as it offers a comforting surface without compromising the looks. It is an affordable and durable flooring option among homeowners. Laminate flooring is favorable as it offers the DIY application and under the feet, it is a luxury. There are various details of laminate flooring that many do not know. A few interesting facts about Laminate flooring are:\\nInstalled on any floor\\nA versatile choice is laminate flooring. It may be installed on any flooring top. This is the reason it is referred to as a floating floor. There is no need to remove the existing floor to install laminate flooring, while the main prerequisite is to have a flat and clean existing floor. Laminate has a resin coating that the external layer is tough, durable, and scratch-resistant.\\nDifferent from Parquet\\nPeople are confused between laminate flooring and parquet. They are different. Laminate is a result of fusing multiple synthetic layers using the lamination process. The fiberboard is of high-density but it replicates the wood floors look owing to a photographic layer. Meanwhile, Parquet is done by fixing real hardwood pieces together in a geometric pattern to offer a decorative effect.\\nEasy to remove or install\\nLaminate flooring is easy to install like LEGO assembling. There is an interlocking system that allows locking together easily during installation. There is no need for adhesives or nails for the flooring. Likewise, if you have plans to shift to a new house, then laminate flooring may be dismantled and it can be reinstalled in your new house.\\n\\nDoes not hold allergens or mold\\nA great option for asthma patients and allergy sufferers is the laminate flooring. The flooring on its surface does not hold any allergen or mold. There is no need for any adhesive to install laminate flooring, thereby the indoor air is formaldehyde-free.\\nThe top layer has an image printed\\nThe laminate flooring top layer looks like genuine hardwood, marble or stone flooring. This is a detailed photographic image layer printed using printing technology.\\xa0 Laminate flooring is cost-effective flooring that is also scratch-resistant featuring interesting qualities. A wonderful soft-feel is felt on installing laminate flooring.\\nLaminate flooring comes in planks and tanks. It appears in the printed image of high-quality that it reduces noise, costs of heating during winter, and stress on joints and bones. The stain- resistant nature ensures easy maintenance, but spills must be cleaned quickly. This is because laminate is not waterproof.',\n"," 'In light of the COVID-19 national emergency and the resulting fact that students are having to work from home, leading safeguarding provider One Team Logic is offering all schools free usage of its MyConcern software.\\nThe unprecedented school closures and social distancing measures in place across the UK, are leading to a significant number of concerns amongst educators about the welfare of pupils and students. Schools, which are a safe haven for many pupils, will now no longer be accessible to all. This will inevitably cause an increase in safeguarding risks that will still need to be managed; in most cases, managed remotely.\\nWhilst the most vulnerable children (such as those on Child Protection Plans and Looked After Children) will continue to attend school alongside the children of critical workers, there will be a significant number of children who will be at home and who remain at risk of serious harm as a result of abuse, neglect, anxiety, poverty and a whole host of other safeguarding and pastoral issues.\\nMartin Baker, co-founder and CEO of One Team Logic said, “With the safety and wellbeing of children and young adults at the heart of everything we do, we recognise the incredibly difficult situation that educators face in this uncertain time.\\n“We are therefore offering access to the MyConcern Safeguarding Software free of charge to all schools that currently don’t have an electronic record keeping system.\\xa0 We will offer this service free of charge until September 2020 by which time we hope that schools will have resumed ‘normal service’.”\\nMyConcern will ensure that all staff whether remote or onsite will be able to quickly and easily record safeguarding concerns, and Safeguarding Leads will receive an instant notification of all concerns recorded with full reporting functionality.\\nTo take advantage of this offer, please complete the online form with your details, email for details at c19@myconcern.co.uk, or call on 0330 6600 757.',\n"," 'The impact of Coronavirus is affecting people in many ways.

He would urge us to tackle the immediate challenges we face with the pandemic, but not to lose sight of the long-term goals. Prince Albert was a master of innovation and sought to promote it all his life, reminding us of the need to support and develop our young people and to nurture their curiosity. I am looking forward to seeing what young people today make of Albert’s story and the ways in which it will inspire them to create new inventions for 2020 and beyond.”\\nDr Hayaatun Sillem CBE, CEO of the Royal Academy of Engineering, says “Young people are natural engineers – creative, problem solving, adaptable. This is an amazing opportunity for them to think about how they might use engineering to help protect the planet and showcase their ideas, in the style of the famous Great Exhibition of 1851.

If so, you should consider continuing your medical education by becoming a nurse practitioner. Did you know that there are nearly 3 million registered nurses in the U.S, compared to only 1.1 million doctors? With the need for medical care growing at an alarming rate, an opportunity has arised for registered nurses; a chance to continue their education and become a nurse practitioner. In areas such as pediatrics, family medicine, and more, becoming a nurse practitioner is as attractive as it is accomplishable.\\nWhy the Need for Nurse Practitioners?\\nWith the end of the “Baby Boomers” looming, and young-new families growing, there is a need for reliable healthcare but at an affordable price. Nurse practitioners are able to perform a vast majority of procedures that doctors can, but at a lower cost to the patient. This high-level care, at a reasonable cost, is beneficial to those either without insurance or little to no medical benefits at all. A perfect example of the need for nurse practitioners in the medical field, is in adult-geratric medicine. Both the public and medical demand for nurse practitioners is hard to ignore. In fact, over the past few years, primary care and urgent care facilities have seen an increase in hiring nurse practitioners. The upsides to being a nurse practitioner are three fold: the public demand, the medical need, and the fiscal benefits.\\nThe Financial Gain \\nThe average salary for a nurse practitioner is $110,030, which is far greater than the average salary of a registered nurse being around $65,000 (for individual state averages click here). However, some might be worried about the cost involved in continuing their education against the job availability post-graduation. The good news is this, with schools like Regis College,\\xa0 becoming a nurse practitioner is more affordable than ever. By applying for your post-masters certificates at Regis, you will be well on your way to building your nursing career. \\xa0With there being an estimated\\xa0 job increase of nearly 30%, over the next 8 years, now is the perfect time to consider continuing your medical education and becoming a nurse practitioner. The financial gain of furthering your medical career is enticing; and being able to help others in the process makes becoming a nurse practitioner even more desirable.\\nIs this the Right Fit for Me?\\nBeing a registered nurse is rewarding, challenging, and admirable. Choosing to take care of the needs of others is what sets those in the medical field apart from the rest of the world. There will always be a demand for careers in the medical field, and there are many great jobs to choose from. However, before you decide on whether or not to become a nurse practitioner, it is important to remember the reason you are in the medical field to begin with; to help bring health back to your community. Are you ready to gain more responsibility and authority in your nursing career? Then becoming a nurse practitioner is your opportunity of a lifetime. Take the chance, grow your education, and help meet the demands of a growing medical field.',\n"," 'With the increasing sophistication of information technology, and financial pressures, it is vital for schools to have an IT partner they can trust.

Experts forecast high voter turnout in the 2020 election. This being the case, socially engaged voters would do well to learn about civics, in order to develop informed positions when taking part in the upcoming election.\\nCitizenship \\nThe US Constitution is meant to enforce the natural rights of all U.S. citizens, regardless of their race, religion, gender, or other characteristics. A first-year political science course would introduce students to these and other concepts. The essential values of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness were first codified into the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and the Bill of Rights expanded on these concepts.\\nAt the federal level, the United States is a Democratic Republic, where citizens elect representatives who make decisions for them. Every citizen is not only free to take part in elections, but it is also in his or her best interest to do so from an informed position. This may be especially true for immigrants who may have come from more authoritarian homelands.\\nCivics and civic education \\n‘Civics’ comes from the French word ‘civique’ which means ‘citizen.’ Essential components of a curriculum in civics include a number of best-practices, often referred to as the Six Proven Practices for Effective Civic Learning framework. These include:\\n\\nProvide instruction in government, history, law, and democracy\\nIncorporate discussion of current local, national, and international issues and events in the classroom, particularly those that young people view as important to their lives\\nDesign and implement programs that provide students with opportunities to apply what they learn through performing community service that is linked to the formal curriculum and classroom instruction.\\nOffer extracurricular activities that provide opportunities for young people to get involved in their schools or communities\\nEncourage student participation in school governance.\\nEncourage students’ participation in simulations of democratic processes and procedures.\\n\\nWhereas some people believe that values, social justice, and democracy are at their best when they are learned actively through experience, it’s commonly believed that schools must be able to encourage ethical behavior and personal responsibility consisting of the freedom of choice and action, and consequently bearing the results of one’s action. Civic education empowers citizens to be well-informed, active and conscious about their rights and duties. Often, the goal of such courses in civics is to empower students to feel responsible for shaping the world around them.\\nDemocracy\\nDemocracy is a political system that is based on participation in group decision-making. The United States is not actually a democracy at the federal level. In the case of the President, representatives are elected in every state, and the Electoral College determines the outcome, rather than the national popular vote. Civic education equips people with the knowledge to understand the basics of the electoral process. People learn how to protect and support this system of governance and its constant implementation.\\nCivic education is also used to teach people the most important aspects of the US Constitution. Such an education generally begins with the Bill of Rights but may extend into other areas of the Constitution. The Preamble establishes the purpose of the Constitution, with no force in law. Other sections of the Constitution go on to describe the three branches of government: the Legislative branch, the Judicial branch, and the Executive branch.\\nRights and duties of US citizens\\nAll citizens should be aware of their civil rights,so as not to be deprived of their freedom. Among these rights are free expression and a right to a prompt, fair trial by jury. Citizens may vote in elections for public officials, to apply for federal employment requiring U.S. citizenship, and to run for elected office.\\nAs well as rights, every citizen has his/her duties. They are commonly also referred to as responsibilities or obligations. Among the most crucial is a duty to support and defend the Constitution, to participate in the voting process, to stay informed of the issues affecting one’s community and to participate in it, and to respect the rights, beliefs, and opinions of others. Moreover, every citizen is obliged to obey federal, state, and local laws, which includes taxation, and serving on a jury when called upon.\\nThe Importance of an Education in Civics and Political Science\\nCivics knowledge is used to better every citizen’s life. It’s an essential component of political science, which is applicable to practice. Interest in Civics arises as an urge to keep the US a free and prosperous nation. In 2020, there will be a battle of ideas to determine the direction of the United States over the next four years. While politicians call every election “the most important election in history,” it may actually be true this time around.',\n"," 'Continuing its series of highly popular interactive LearnEd Roadshow training events for teachers, the Department for Education (DfE), Havering Education Services (HES), Corbets Tey school and BESA announce a national education technology conference focusing on SEND on Thursday 14 November 2019.\\nDesigned to deliver free access to peer-to-peer guidance and first-hand insights, LearnED SEND edition provides teachers, leadership teams and SENCOs with a platform to share best practice and advice on the best use of technology in the classroom.\\nStaff at Corbets Tey special school, will be providing real-life classroom demonstrations and sharing their experiences of working with other schools and suppliers to gather expertise and specialist approaches to using technology effectively, to support SEND students.

These academies are independent schools which receive their funding directly from the Government as opposed to their local council – this provides these academies with freedom and independence so that they can establish their own approach of providing education to pupils.\\nEncouraging Conversion to Academies\\nThe 2010 Academies Act in 2010 then gave all schools in England the freedom to choose to become an academy – now over 50% of pupils in the state-funded education system are taught in an academy or free school. So, why are so many schools now becoming academies and what are the benefits to both students and the schools?\\nFreedom to Innovate\\nThe main benefit is that the school is free to innovate. Although still inspected by Ofsted, an academy has the freedom to set its own rules and spend the funding how it wishes. This means that you often see academies using the latest and best technology, have alternative lengths of school days and term times and devising their own curriculum. Essentially, this hands the power back to the schools who know how to make the best decisions for pupils and their communities.\\nTypes of Academies\\nThere are two main types of academies and it is important to be aware of the difference. A sponsored academy, as the name suggests, will have sponsors who have control of the academy trust (academies run by individual charitable bodies) – these are usually schools which have under-performed and converted improve their performance. A converter academy, meanwhile, is a school which was successful and often had excellent Ofsted grades which has chosen to convert for increased autonomy (these were introduced in 2010 as part of the Academies Act).\\nConverting\\nThe opinion on academies is mixed with some stating that academies improve twice as fast as state schools while others claim that it is a way of privatising the school system. Again, results are mixed with some academies performing exceptionally well while others have struggled which is a symptom of providing so much freedom. It is certainly a complex area and one which should carefully be considered by any state school. It is a good idea to seek expert legal advice from somewhere like Browne Jacobson on relation to converting to an academy.\\nThere has been a push in recent times for schools to make the switch to academies and it is easy to see why as there can be many benefits. This provides great freedom and flexibility by giving the schools greater control, but this is also a complex area and one which divides opinion so it is an area that any school will need to carefully consider.',\n"," 'Kids have to reach certain milestones at a given age. You can find charts online that discuss what children can achieve in terms of language. It includes the number of words they can pronounce and the list of words they can understand. Not all kids achieve that milestone at the same time. Some of them are slightly behind, and it’s understandable. They might eventually get to where you want them to be. However, if your child is consistently behind, and the language problems are getting worse by the day, you have to do something about it.\\nSpend more time with your child\\nPerhaps, you’re too busy with work and household chores that you don’t realise your child is already experiencing language difficulties. The problem worsens when your child has no one to talk to. You’re not always around. Therefore, if possible, you have to spend more time talking to your child. You could play games, read books or fool around. The goal is that your child can hear you speak and practice the natural use of language.\\nCheck what your child watches online\\xa0\\nIf you’re one of those cool parents who are okay with letting your child watch videos on YouTube without checking them, your child could be in trouble. It’s easy to click on any video online, and your child might open inappropriate or unnecessary content. For instance, it’s possible for your child to encounter cartoon videos in a different language. It will confuse your child even more. Some videos also have characters who baby talk, and it doesn’t help improve language learning at all. Try to control the videos your child watches online to avoid confusion and promote learning.\\nConsult with a speech pathologist\\nIt might be time to get an expert opinion if you think that the remedies you tried aren’t working at all. Experts know how to keep your child up to speed. They will diagnose the problem and look for methods that might work for your child. It might be pricey, but worth the fees when you know it’s the only way for your child to learn better.\\nUse educational apps\\xa0\\nIt’s possible that your child loves to play with a smartphone or tablet and taking it away could cause tension. Instead of depriving your child of the chance to use the phone for fun, you can maximise available technology such as educational apps. With the aid of apps like Kidsmart, your child will learn and enjoy at the same time. Some apps focus only on language learning. They help improve pronunciation and grammar.\\xa0 Since your kid doesn’t feel like being in a traditional classroom setting, it won’t be difficult to encourage the use of this app.\\nDon’t freak out that your child doesn’t speak clearly or is yet to catch up with everyone else. It’s never too late. You can look for strategies to promote language learning.

In addition, teacher surveys consistently rank noisy classrooms and vocal fatigue high on their list of frustrations. TIP: A medium-density ceiling tile, strikes the right balance between both sound attenuation and sound absorption, blocking unwanted noise from outside while enhancing sound quality inside.\\nAny area in an education setting will have an optimum reverberation time (RT) requirement depending upon its use and size and whether the main activity is speech or music-based. Providing too much sound absorption, and hence having a very low RT, can be just as acoustically damaging and undesirable as having insufficient sound absorption when an excessively long reverberation time will result. An acoustic module available from some manufacturers enables a simple indicative calculation of reverberation time to be made. TIP: The installation of clouds and canopies in a reverberant space such as dining halls, lobbies and school halls, can significantly reduce the reverberation time and contribute to the reduction in background noise.\\nFire resistance in a suspended ceiling can only be achieved by a combined tile and grid system as there is no such thing as a fire resistant tile or a fire resistant grid. TIP: Depending upon national legislation, the type of structure to be protected and a manufacturer’s product offer, ceiling systems can provide at least 30 and more than 60 minutes’ protection against fire.\\nThe acoustic treatment of ceilings does not have to come at the expense of other educational “technologies” which are increasingly integrated as more IT and interactive systems are applied to help the teaching and learning of students in multiple ways. TIP: Ceiling systems can offer integrated solutions that incorporate all necessary ceiling fixtures as well as IT appliances, while also providing a seamless monolithic look.\\nPoor lighting and glare in the classroom can also cause eye strain and fatigue for both staff and students. TIP: A well-designed ceiling with high light reflectance improves the overall illumination and lighting uniformity of the room, directly affecting students’ working comfort and productivity. In addition, high light reflectance ceiling tiles can provide cost savings of up to 20%, equating to as much as an 11% reduction of the energy buildings use.\\n\\nFor more information on specifying education ceilings, visit our education page where you can also download the Armstrong Ceiling Solutions education brochure.',\n"," 'Today, more than\\xa077,800 International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Programme (MYP) students from around the world are receiving their eAssessment results from the May 2019 examination session.\\nThis represents\\xa0an\\xa08% increase compared with last year.\\xa0819 schools in\\xa098\\xa0countries participated,\\xa0and students received an average\\xa0score of\\xa036.54\\xa0points (of 56 possible maximum).\\nRegulated by Ofqual in the UK, the MYP eAssessment (on-screen assessments and ePortfolios) aims to challenge\\xa0students to think critically and independently while solving real-world problems using a broad range of knowledge. 75% of the assessment focusses on inquiry, communication and critical thinking skills, while the other 25% focuses on knowledge and understanding.\\xa0\\xa0MYP eAssessments utilise media-rich on-screen examinations that enable creative responses, or responses that require students to manipulate data and present new understandings using much more dynamic methods than on paper.\\nHaving only been introduced in 2016, the MYP eAssessment has received several accolades including; Best Use of Summative Assessment\\xa0at the\\xa0e-Assessment\\xa0Awards, Best Assessment Solution\\xa0award at the\\xa0ScooNews\\xa0Global Education Awards and is a finalist for this year’s PIEoneer Awards that are taking place in September.\\nPaula Wilcock, IB’s Chief Assessment Officer, said: “I want to wish all the students receiving their MYP results my warmest congratulations.

Traditionally your go to would be an elevator pitch, in theory short enough to pitch whilst travelling a few floors in a lift, but you can take it that step further by condensing down your business proposition and benefit to just one sentence. It’s easy to get caught up in the detail, especially if you are passionate about your business, however everyone won’t need or be interested in the finer details. Consider how you would explain your business to an eight or eighty year old and you won’t go far wrong.\\nLook for Experts\\nIt’s well documented from some of the world’s greatest business leaders who have credited part of their success comes from hiring people who can do what they can’t, and that is vital when building your network. Often businesses are looking to venture in new markets when growing. This is a natural step for a business to take but in order to achieve this you need local experts and skills. Whilst you can identify other market potential as a business – whether in Europe or further afield – you won’t have local knowledge. The small, and what may seem insignificant regional nuances can often put a halt to either setting up a base in the region or hiring the right team. This is a recipe for failure and your ventures to new markets will be short lived. Therefore it’s worth looking to build your network based on local experts who can help guide you in those early days to provide longevity as your business grows.\\nLook for Middle Ground\\nOnce you are building your network think about mutual exchange, and championing them where possible. Often a personal recommendation can go a long way, or perhaps an introductory meeting with a new contact. Considering what you have to offer as a business – whether that’s office co-share space or joint partnerships on projects – to support your network is a big factor. In a world where our online brand is as important, if not in some cases more important than our offline brand – social media and websites are key. Can you conduct a blog exchange with someone in your network that your target audience might find beneficial, or can you share upcoming events to your network which might help expand contacts for all parties involved? Overlooked for more pressing business actions, actually conducting regular social media activities will help nurture your network. In the modern day the age old skill of networking and partnerships certainly hasn’t died out.\\nWe now function in fully connected world – both online and offline. Whether building your local or global network is your focus, the power it holds can help you build a successful business, taking you to the next stage of your growth.',\n"," 'Primary school pupils are being given the chance to shape the services offered in schools in North Yorkshire and beyond.\\nIn the first event of its kind, up to 200 year 6 pupils took part in interactive workshops to give a valuable insight and help to develop a variety of services offered by the county council to schools from recruiting teachers, to making school meals more enticing to teaching maths.\\nThe Pupil Innovation Festival was held at Thirsk Racecourse by North Yorkshire Education Services (NYES), which is run by the county council.\\xa0 Pupils were given the chance to trial the use of artificial intelligence with technology partner Century Tech; give their views to Teesside University on the development of virtual reality games to support maths teaching; trial a ‘waste and wormeries’ lesson with Yorwaste, and work with Matt Leivers, Group Chef Manager with the Michelin-starred Star Inn restaurants, to develop new school meals.\\nEmma Grunwell, Head of Marketing and Innovation for NYES, said: “We decided to use a completely different approach to develop our services by focusing on the end user. The pupils had an energised, fun-filled day in the process. It’s been great to see such a positive attitude from the students and such great ideas.\\n“I’m especially keen to see more children making pianos from bananas and getting involved in sampling a meal created by a chef working for a group of restaurants with a Michelin star – not many pupils will get that on their menu every day!”\\nPupils also talked to staff about what they love about school and what they believe makes a great teacher to help the county council’s in-house teacher recruitment team.\\nThe festival focused on helping to raise attainment and awareness of pupil’s mental health.\\xa0 External experts Deputy Mitchell and Chimp Management provided techniques and new ways of working to help pupils to manage their emotions.\\nCounty Councillor Patrick Mulligan, North Yorkshire’s Executive Member for Education and Skills, said: “Our pupils had so much fun and were full of wonderful ideas so we are really looking forward to seeing some of these come to life over the next few months. We are hoping to continue to use this valuable pupil insight to develop a range of our services, including school catering, school improvement, energy and sustainability and teacher recruitment.”\\nChristina Alexander, a teacher at Alverton Community Primary School, Northallerton, said: “It’s been an education for the pupils in the widest sense, as education isn’t just about lessons – the pupils’ horizons have been broadened through this event, so it has been really valuable.”',\n"," 'Hematology is the branch of pathology or medicine that involves the study of the causes, treatments, prognosis, and prevention of blood-related conditions. Any disease that affects the blood and its components such as hemoglobin, blood proteins, platelets, blood cells, and bone marrow is classified in this category. The diseases can include leukemia, hemophilia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The physicians who specialize in the fields of hematology are called hematologists or hematopathologists. Since hematology is very broad, there is room for more specializing and get into more specific disciplines that include;\\n\\nHaemato-oncology\\n\\nHaemato-oncology discipline involves the study and treatment of blood cancers such as acute and chronic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma. These cancers occur because of cell overgrowth, so the physicians focus on how to control blood cells and other blood components from growing out of control. Hematology jobs are available for people who specialize in Haemato-oncology are plenty because blood-related cancers are on the rise.\\n\\nHemostasis/thrombosis\\n\\nAnother popular discipline in hematology is hemostasis and thrombosis because they are two sides of the same coin. Hemostasis is basically blood clotting, which is normal and prevents too much blood loss in case of an injury. Thrombosis, on the other hand, is the formation of clots inside the blood vessels, which is the main cause of heart attacks, stroke, and anginas. The physicians who specialize in this area, therefore, study and treat hemostasis and thrombosis disorders, whether congenital or acquired. They can include bleeding disorders like hemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\\n\\nBlood cell production disorders.\\n\\nBlood cell disorders occur when there is a problem with red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Red blood cells carry oxygen to different organs, while white blood cells carry nutrients and fight infections. Some of the conditions that come up as a result of blood cell abnormalities include various forms of anemia, thalassemia, hemophilia, Von Willebrand disease, primary thrombocythemia, and blood cancers.\\n\\nTransfusion medicine\\n\\nTransfusion is yet another. Many people think that any doctor is allowed to perform a blood transfusion. This is a vast discipline that involves using another person’s blood to treat a patient. Transfusion therapy is an area that requires a lot of knowledge on blood types, blood sources, donor selection, and blood collection. The physicians who are experts in transfusion usually run the blood bank in hospitals and blood donor centers across the world.\\n\\nPediatric Hematology\\n\\nChildren have unique medical needs that require specialized care. Pediatric hematology specifically looks at blood disorders in children from birth to teenage. After finishing medical school, the physician has to do pediatric residency and then study pediatric hematology for three additional years. This discipline is one of the most complicated areas; hence the many years of study and hands-on experience because children are very delicate. A pediatric doctor also needs to have a personality that sits well with kids and also have a special liking and understanding of children.\\nThe sky is the limit when it comes to hematology, and there are many fields one can specialize in. In the course of the training, the institutions will give you hands-on experience in your field of choice so you can find the relevant opportunities in your job search.',\n"," 'Hackney Learning Trust believes that every member staff in schools should have in place a comprehensive professional development pathway.

But what does that mean exactly? Education can come in many different forms, some formal and very high level and others not so much but learning is important for both our professional careers and also our personal well being. Here are a few of the different types of learning we can pursue and what are the advantages of each.\\nUndergraduate University Degree\\nAn undergraduate university degree is the standard type of degree people are talking about when they refer to a university degree. Study at this level tends to be in academic rather than practical or vocational subjects, meaning that it is more likely you will be learning theory, writing essays and conducting research projects or experiments in a science degree. Some types of degree are a precursor to further study to then obtain a professional qualification in areas such as law or medicine and other degrees actually qualify you for a certain job straight away such as nursing or teaching and others will give you a good degree that shows you are a dedicated individual that can achieve something.\\nPost-Graduate University Degree\\nIf you want to study further at university then a postgraduate degree is just that, one undertaken after graduating from an undergraduate course. These are generally divided into a one year Masters degree or a PhD doctorate, which is a research degree where you are adding a useful contribution to the academic world and will be able to use the title of Doctor on completion.\\nCollege\\nTraditionally college may have been thought of as a lesser form of learning than university but it’s really just study with a different aim and outcome. You are more often studying a vocational qualification, one that prepares you for an area of work, such as trades, IT skills and much more. You can do full degrees or one year HNC courses or two year HNDs right down to more entry level NVQs wand you might say, what does NVQ Stand for? It’s a National Vocational Qualification which can give you practical skill in a variety of useful work areas. Also if you are looking to progress in education you can go all the way from NVQ level through a university access course and could go all the way from having no qualifications right up to the highest level of academia.\\nOn The Job Training\\nLearning does not necessarily mean going to college or university there are plenty of examples of on the job training and learning in a variety of workplaces. Most employers will keep a record of training or professional development ranging from basic health and safety courses to learning new skills and management training schemes. You should also ask if any of your employers training schemes earn you a recognised qualification or certificate and, if so, get and keep a copy of that. You can also complete a more formal apprenticeship within many industries these days and this often involves a certain amount of time at college paid for by your employer.',\n"," 'An exciting new school project will encourage thousands of British students to realise their inner space expert and explore the Universe, thanks to teaching resources including 15,000 free books. To celebrate the UK’s involvement with one of the most globally-anticipated space missions, the James Webb Space Telescope, the Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC) today launch a new primary education programme, in partnership with the publisher\\xa0Curved House Kids.\\nThe Deep Space Diary programme introduces KS2/P5-7 students to astronomy, physics, engineering and space through the story of the James Webb Space Telescope. With the support of the STFC, 15,000 free books will be available to schools across the UK with priority given to those in disadvantaged areas or with high numbers of pupil premium.\\nThe Deep Space Diary is the third book in the series, with the previous two created with the UK Space Agency, author Lucy Hawking and inspired by European Space Agency (ESA) Astronaut Tim Peake’s 2015 Principia mission.\\nTim Peake says:\\xa0 “In 2015 we created the Principia Space Diary to empower younger students to learn about space and science while they followed my mission to the International Space Station. That book, and the subsequent Mars Diary sequel, were a huge success as they tackle a range of challenging subjects in a creative and hands-on way. I’m excited to see the ideas and innovations our young British space experts come up with as they complete this new Deep Space Diary and explore the biggest questions about our Universe.”\\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (or simply Webb), due to launch in 2021, is the largest space telescope ever built (the size of a tennis court when deployed) and is expected to reveal even more about the Universe than its predecessor, Hubble. Webb is a global project, led by NASA, with some of its key experts in Europe and the UK. The Deep Space Diary makes this incredible human achievement accessible for younger students by delivering complex ideas in creative, student-led ways. The diary was also developed with and features a diverse group of real engineers and astronomers who have worked on Webb or will use it to explore the Universe.\\nEuropean Principle Investigator for MIRI Professor Gillian Wright said: “Celebrating the involvement that the UK has in this revolutionary mission, whilst at the same time giving children an insight in to how exciting being involved in a space science mission can be makes this a very special project; after all they will be the scientists and engineers of the future.”\\nFrom today (Thursday 13th June) primary schools in the UK are invited to register at discoverydiaries.org for a chance to receive a free box of 30 Deep Space Diaries plus stickers and a Mission Log poster for their class. Books will be allocated to schools on a first come, first served basis with priority given to those in disadvantaged areas or with a higher percentage of free school meals. Other schools, home educating families and community groups can also register to access the free online programme, or purchase printed diaries via the online bookshop. Books will be delivered in September 2019, at the beginning of the new school year.\\nTeachers are fully supported with an online portal containing over 60 hours of classroom and home learning activities, differentiated teaching notes, curriculum guides (for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland), extension activities, multimedia resources and more. The programme also provides cross-curricular links, combining STEM learning with a breadth of other subjects to ensure that every child can find a way in to science and engineering. Publisher Kristen Harrison says: “Our goal with the Discovery Diaries is not necessarily to hot-house future STEM experts (though that’s a happy bi-product!) but to encourage every child, regardless of their skills, interests or circumstances, to imagine, create, question, research, visualise, analyse, problem solve and generally “think like a scientist”. These are skills that will help them throughout their lives and the James Webb Space Telescope is the perfect inspiration for all of that.”\\nThe Deep Space Diary has been developed by Curved House Kids with Dr Olivia Johnson at STFC’s UK Astronomy Technology Centre and Royal Observatory Edinburgh. A skilled team of practising primary teachers have co-written teaching materials and curriculum guides and Professor Peter McOwan at Queen Mary University of London has provided academic advice and feedback on activities.',\n"," 'Secondary school students from across Great Britain have been named regional and category winners in Shell’s national schools’ competition, The Bright Ideas Challenge.\\nEach school’s bright ideas have won them £1,500 to boost STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) learning.\\nBy 2070, it’s estimated there will be around 10 billion people on the planet, with demand for energy set to double.

The campaign is aimed at 10 to 12 year olds, parents and teachers and designed to help support the critical step of beginning secondary school. Packed with videos, interactive games, and tips and advice, Starting Secondary School will help children across the UK during their last term in primary school and through their critical first weeks at secondary school.\\nIn September 2019, 752,528 children will move up to secondary school across the UK. Moving from primary to secondary school is an exciting time for many young people, but it can also be a daunting prospect. Research shows that, for some young people, it can negatively affect their social, emotional and academic outcomes leading to less engagement, lower attainment, reduced confidence, increased anxiety, loneliness and behaviour issues.\\nHelen Foulkes, Senior Head of Content Production, BBC Education said “Beginning secondary school is a huge milestone for children and research repeatedly shows that if it goes badly there can be long term consequences. The BBC is working in partnership with YoungMinds to help support children directly, but also provide advice for parents and resources for teachers. We hope this will further support the schools and charities working hard to ease transition at such an important time in children’s lives.”\\nStarting Secondary School has lots of content hosted on the ever-popular BBC Bitesize including:\\n· Peer-to-peer advice from the stars of CBBC series Our School who have first-hand experience of making the move to secondary school\\n· Practical tips for parents on how to prepare their child for secondary school\\n· Bespoke classroom clips and resources for teachers on BBC Teach, to help start discussions around transition, produced in partnership with YoungMinds\\nMore content will be added each week at www.bbc.com/startingsecondaryschool\\nDeirdre Kehoe, Director of Training and Services, YoungMinds said “Starting secondary school can be a daunting and stressful experience for children, and, in some cases, it can coincide with the emergence of underlying mental health problems. That’s why we’re delighted to be working with BBC Education to make sure that children, parents and teachers are as well prepared as possible to cope with the change. We hope that as many teachers as possible will use our Find Your Feet lesson plans and resources, as a way of helping children to face their worries, talk about how they feel and gain the skills to manage these challenges.”\\nMr Burton, Headteacher, and star of Channel 4’s Educating Yorkshire is supporting Starting Secondary School and said: “Children’s biggest fears when they start school can range from losing contact with their old friends, to coping with the extra demands of daily homework, to getting lost in a much bigger building. Starting Secondary School addresses these issues, and others, in the rich variety of content that will appeal to young people. These are important and useful resources that will help students and teachers.”\\nDr Anna Colton, child and adolescent psychologist welcomed the new BBC campaign and said: “Primary school is nurturing, familiar and comfortable. Some children can’t wait to move to secondary, having outgrown it and others will feel scared and wish they could stay for longer. Whichever is the case, a successful transition will provide challenges to which they will rise and thus give a child new skills, confidence and resilience, teaching them that they can cope and survive.\\n“Addressing children’s worries throughout the process and giving them opportunities to experience and talk about the next steps will help prepare them for what lies ahead and how they might handle it. Poor transition can have a detrimental impact to children’s well being, mental health and attainment, so equipping children with the tools to cope with the unfamiliar and with challenges and changes should be welcomed and shared widely.

This is a fantastic achievement, which tells us that children want to cycle, scoot and walk to school.\\n“It also demonstrates there’s a growing public awareness of the effects of motor emissions and the role more walking and cycling can play in reducing them. But to make it easier for parents and pupils to continue travel by bike and foot, the roads outside schools need to feel safe. One of the best ways to do this is by making streets outside the school gates car free.\\n“That’s why we are calling on national governments to support local authorities to enforce School Streets and implement clean air legislation to tackle motorised traffic, including large-scale investment in walking and cycling.”\\nClaudine Richardson, Bike It Champion at St Richard Reynolds Catholic College said: “We decided to take part in the Big Pedal this year as a survey of our students revealed that air pollution and congestion outside the school gate was a big concern.\\n“During the competition we saw a huge surge in the number of pupils walking, scooting or cycling to school and this has continued even after the challenge.

The Literacy Intervention Toolkit (LIT) Programme from Hackney Learning Trust uses mindful and metacognitive teaching strategies to enable Year 7 pupils to become more autonomous and confident in all aspects of literacy. LIT uses evidence-based strategies focused on improving thinking, reading, writing and oral communication skills. It also incorporates effective feedback into each lesson so that pupil progress is maximized.\\nThe new proposed Ofsted framework shifts greater focus towards pupils’ qualitative experiences at school, such as their capacity for learning and how they feel about learning, while still looking closely at academic progress. \\xa0This proposed inspection framework further underlines the need for outstanding teachers to identify and correct understanding, so that on the spot feedback can be incisive and effective for facilitating pupil progress.\\nLIT tackles each of these areas by building ‘key learning checkpoints’ (KLCs) into each lesson plan and pupil resource that enable teachers and pupils to assess their use of a range of literacy strategies. Learning is externalised and dialogic, meaning that learning focuses and strategies are constantly reflected on and talked about. These KLCs are also designed to check the depth of understanding of a broad and meaningful curriculum. Creative and age-appropriate texts and topics are coupled with the KLCs with the aim of ensuring pupils are engaged and intrinsically motivated to learn. In this way, LIT builds pupils’ self-awareness and capacity for learning while simultaneously deepening their subject knowledge and understanding.\\nSam Henstock, LIT Programme coordinator at Ashfield School, one of the largest secondary schools in the country, reports that their LIT pupils make an average of 3 years of reading age progress in a single academic year.\\n“While the levels of attainment are excellent, I think other benefits are equally as important. Numbers aside, the visible improvements in students’ overall confidence and feelings towards reading are extremely rewarding, especially as such positivity continues into Year 8.”\\nBeyond academic progress, LIT equips pupils with thinking, reading, writing and communication strategies that can change their lives academically, socially and professionally. In this way, LIT aims to prepare pupils for the next stage of their lives and to have a lasting and meaningful impact.\\nTo find out more please email Joanna Murray\\xa0or call her on 020 8820 7607 or visit our web page.',\n"," 'Jade Sutton has ADHD and struggled at school between the ages of 9-13.

Every year, Belling will award two primary schools with up to £2,000 worth of cooking appliances, along with fun cooking accessories for the children to use.\\nThe competition is open to all primary schools, with pupils asked to produce a picture of their favourite nutritionally balanced meal, along with a description of why they like it so much and why it’s good for them. Pupils can work on the entry individually or as a class, and each school is asked to select a single entry to be sent to Belling alongside a brief explanation from a member of teaching staff about the school’s existing facilities and what winning the prize would enable them to do. Entries can be as fun and creative as the children like.\\nJane Rylands, Head of Marketing Communications at Belling, said: “We had a great response to Cookery Club last year and we loved looking at all the entries.\\n“We believe children get so much out of learning to cook – physically interacting with ingredients and producing their own food; learning new skills for later life and understanding what is good for them and why. We hope that Belling Cookery Club will give some schools a valuable resource and inspire their pupils to love cooking.”\\nBelling Cookery Club is now open (until Friday April\\xa0 5th)\\xa0 for entry via the Belling website on https://www.belling.co.uk/cookery-club/ where full details, along with Terms and Conditions are available.\\nDetails about last year’s winners can be found here\\xa0https://www.belling.co.uk/cookery-club-winners/',\n"," 'Students from schools across Cambridgeshire are gearing up to compete in the inaugural FIRST® Tech Challenge UK Championships, taking place in Peterborough on Wednesday 13th March.

While children’s sugar intakes have declined slightly in recent years, they are still consuming around eight extra sugar cubes each day , equivalent to around 2,800 excess sugar cubes per year.\\nFor the first time, PHE has developed dedicated English and Maths teaching resources for primary schools across England, to help pupils and their families understand how much sugar is in their food and drink. It will also teach them about making healthier swaps to reduce their sugar intake.\\nThis will complement the national campaign encouraging parents to “make a swap when you next shop”, to help families enjoy healthier versions of the foods and drinks they are currently consuming.\\nToo much sugar can cause preventable health problems. Over a third (34%) of children are leaving primary school overweight or obese, and severe obesity in ten to eleven year olds has now reached an all-time high. More young people than ever before are also developing Type 2 diabetes, and every ten minutes a child in England has a rotten tooth removed in hospital.\\nWhile parents are encouraged to make healthier choices for the whole family, schools can also play an important role in children’s health, as part of a broader wellbeing programme.\\nDeveloped with teachers, the new English lesson plans introduce pupils to the characters of ‘Sugar Smart World’ through fun, interactive PowerPoints, pupil-led activities, recipe ideas from around the world and a new video. Change4Life Maths lesson plans will reinforce healthier swaps, while including important problem solving skills using addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.\\nThrough the lesson activities, children will learn that the number of extra sugar cubes they are consuming is enough to wrap around the world more than three and a half times.\\nJon Moorhouse, Deputy Headteacher, St Saviour CE Primary School, Bolton said: “Change4Life helps children realise just how much sugar is in everyday foods and drinks. The new resources are high quality, adaptable and can be used in other areas of the curriculum like Personal, Social and Health Education, English, Maths and Science.\\n“Being more sugar smart empowers children to help themselves and their families make healthier choices. This could have a big impact on children’s health for the rest of their lives.”\\nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: “Children are consuming too much sugar and obesity is a very real threat to their health. Educating them on the importance of a healthy balanced diet in their early years can help them avoid serious illness in future.\\n“By making simple swaps each day, children can have healthier versions of everyday foods and drinks, while significantly reducing their sugar intake.”\\nThe resources are flexible to use and tailored for Reception, Key Stage 1 and upper and lower Key Stage 2 pupils. They complement recently launched dental lesson plans – the first Change4Life teaching resources to help pupils understand the effects of sugar consumption on teeth.\\nTo get involved with Change4Life, schools and teachers can:\\n• Look out for the Sugar Smart World take-home packs arriving in schools from mid-late January.\\n• Search ‘Change4Life/schools’ online or visit the School Zone to access the new resources for schools.\\n• Sign up to the School Zone to be the first to hear about new teaching resources launching later this year to help embed healthier habits in your school.\\nhttps://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/schools/topics/healthy-eating/overview',\n"," 'Millennium Point Charitable Trust has announced donations of more than £4.8 million to science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) projects across the West Midlands last year.\\nAll of the commercial activity that takes place in the 46,450 square metre landmark Millennium Point building feeds back into the charity, enabling it to donate and invest in STEM-related organisations, projects and initiatives.\\nThis has included a robotics lab and 3D printing facilities at Bishop Vesey Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield, allowing students from surrounding schools to gain experience, knowledge and skills in advanced technology; more than £281,000 to fund four projects by Birmingham Museums Trust including Year of the Engineer 2018 and a Science and Heritage Career Ladder Legacy; working with Birmingham City University’s Faculty of Computing, Engineering and The Built Environment to offer a free undergraduate STEM degree through the Millennium Point scholarship, now in its fifth year.

I am truly excited to be leading the organisation and ensuring that we are a transformative force within the education sector ensuring that tomorrow’s leaders are as diverse as they are driven.”\\nwww.villierspark.org.uk',\n"," 'A new campaign led by University of Sussex academics is urging teachers and pupils to be allowed to embrace uncertainty and explore new ways to engage with knowledge.\\nTRANSFORM-iN EDUCATION is designed to support teaching staff and pupils to have time and space within the day to break with convention which the campaign’s founders Dr Perpetua Kirby and Dr Rebecca Webb believe is necessary to ensure a creative and critical society where everyone is better able to respond to life situations where the answer is not always clear.\\nDr Kirby and Dr Webb are looking to work with schools and other educational institutions, to support them to look beyond conformity within the school day, which they define as only learning what others already know to pass exams. The academics believe that while it is important to value existing knowledge, it is also vital to explore different ways of thinking and doing things.\\nDr Webb, a Lecturer in Early Years and Primary Education at the University of Sussex, said: “In our current education system, children become successful by acquiring lots of curriculum knowledge and behaving in particular ways. Teachers, who, by implication, must never ‘not know’ and deviate from always explaining what things mean – this means constantly and continuously working ever harder to fill more efficiently and effectively the pupil with certain knowledge.\\n“We feel that this a really optimum time to launch this, it feels like there could be a positive reception for new thinking within the sector. Higher education encourages students to engage in transformative ‘disruptive thinking’, it’s certainly something we have put at the heart of what we do at the University of Sussex, and so it’s imperative that schools follow suit. ”\\nThe campaigners say they want to help influence a change of policy on a national level and broaden the current models of education they have observed during in-depth research in schools which they say assumes certainty about the knowledge presented to students with very little time or opportunity for uncertainty.\\nThey warn that there is currently too much emphasis on pupils conforming to the standards of good behaviour of prolonged sitting in silence and working hard to find the correct answer. Their research highlights that being good can camouflage an avoidance of effort for some pupils, including engaging in new and unexpected challenges where the answer is unclear.\\nDr Webb and Dr Kirby stress the importance of having higher expectations for pupils – that go beyond simply learning what is in the curriculum – to create new knowledge. This includes sharing opinions, questioning the ways things have always been done, pursuing new questions and experimenting with different approaches. Their studies identify that pupils are already working with uncertainty, but mostly alone without the support of a teacher.\\nUniversity of Sussex masters pupil, Mariyam Ahmed Toor, identifies the limits of current schooling for her generation. She said: “We don’t understand that it’s okay to feel uncertain and to not have answers all the time.\\xa0In fact, somewhere along the way, we were taught in schools that uncertainty is bad which is so ironic because life is anything but certain.\\xa0And so, instead of feeling liberated in our 20s, we feel overwhelmed and unsure because every move we make needs to be grounded in certainty.”\\nTRANSFORM-iN EDUCATION will bring together academic and non-academic stakeholders, especially teachers, parents, head teachers and students at schools and colleges, to promote more and better opportunities for different ways of experiencing knowledge in school. It’s founders hope to offer a forum to draw on the talents and expertise of teaching staff, who they say do not currently have the opportunities to step outside existing demands within schools.\\nThe campaign will organise and attend events for researchers and teaching professionals to explore the balance of conformity and transformation in schooling, including the tensions in pursuing both goals.\\nDr Kirby, an Associate in the School of Education and Social Work at the University of Sussex, said: “Our research has highlighted the need for the space to produce knowledge differently, what we call transformation. We need to listen to how teachers and students want to create spaces that are better suited to the rapidly changing context of the twenty-first century. This demands that we respond in ways not known or even imagined before, whilst not forgetting what we already know.”\\n www.transformineducation.org',\n"," 'Professor Alan Kwan, deputy head of school at Cardiff University, with scholars Lequesha Gonsalves and Robert White© 2018 Andrew Wiard\\nAlmost 400 UK teens have been honoured by one of the UK’s leading engineering programmes.\\nSome 393 students – including a record-equalling 113 girls – achieved a coveted Arkwright Engineering Scholarship award as part of a drive to inspire future leaders in engineering.\\nThe talented group, aged 16-17, were presented with their accolades at aerospace-themed ceremonies at the Institute of Engineering and Technology in London and the International Conference Centre in Edinburgh, supported by principal awards ceremony sponsors, the RAF.\\nThose honoured were handpicked from 1,600 hopefuls who applied for the scholarship in 2018 following a rigorous selection process, which assesses their academic, practical and leadership skills in engineering disciplines.\\nThe awards were presented by RAF Group Captain Tony Keeling, Air Marshal Julian Young and Air Vice Marshal Ross Paterson.\\nDr Kevin P Stenson, chief executive of the Smallpeice Trust, the UK’s leading national STEM education charity that runs the scholarships programme, said: “This year has seen an incredibly talented group of young people become scholars.

Nearly half of those (49%) cited workload as the primary reason for wanting to leave the profession, whilst 45% cited a lack of government funding allocated to SEND support.\\nAs such, almost all (95%) SENCOs surveyed believe they should have legally protected time to enable them to fulfil the demands of the role.\\nDr Helen Curran, Senior Lecturer in Education: SEN at Bath Spa University, said: “‘The National SENCO Workload Survey has demonstrated how, in 2018, SENCOs are managing this challenging, yet rewarding, role. However, the survey has also illustrated how a lack of time to execute the role is not only affecting SENCOs, both professionally and personally, but is also impacting on children with SEND. SENCOs are seeking ways in which they can meet the demands of the role, often at a personal cost. Yet, this does not present a sustainable option for SENCOs or children alike. That this why, through the National SENCO Workload Survey, we are seeking protected time for the SENCO role.”\\nDr Adam Boddison, Chief Executive at nasen added: “We were delighted to work on this joint project with Bath Spa University and NEU. The overwhelming response to the survey really demonstrates the dedication and commitment of SENCOs. It also highlights the critical importance of the role and why it matters to give them the capacity they need to perform the role effectively. This is an important step for SENCOs nationally,as we begin the discussion around the time SENCOs need to fulfil the demands of the role”.\\nNansi Ellis, Assistant General Secretary, National Education Union, said: “It is clear from the survey findings that SENCO workload is becoming unmanageable and pupils with SEND are suffering for it. 95% of SENCOs told us that they need adequate protected time to carry out their role which means the Government must fund schools properly so that heads can provide it. The report also highlights the important role of teaching and learning support staff in enabling inclusion in schools.\\n“Government funding cuts are having a devastating effect as schools face the difficult decision of whether to make savings through redundancies or provide appropriate support for children with SEND. It is a choice they should not have to be making. SENCOs in the survey said they hate not being able to offer all the support they believe students need because of time pressures and funding constraints. It’s time for the Government to listen to the SEND experts.”\\nThe National SENCO Workload Survey focused on how the SENCO role in schools was managed, specifically exploring the time and support SENCOs were able to access to enable them to effectively facilitate their role.More than 1,900 (1,903) SENCOs responded to the survey.\\nEighty-five per cent of respondents reported that they work in a state funded, mainstream school in England. There are currently 20,202 state-funded schools in England, which indicates the survey was undertaken by eight per cent of SENCOs in the UK who currently work in state funded, mainstream primary or secondary schools in England.\\nTo read the full report, please visit: www.bathspa.ac.uk/sencosurvey',\n"," 'A Midlands teacher is hoping to help transform maths teaching in the region thanks to a fact finding trip to China.\\nFaye Glendinning, Strategic Leader for Maths at Birmingham’s Cedars Academy, will spend two weeks in Shanghai as part of the nationwide Maths Hub exchange programme between England and China, representing the Midlands as part of the scheme.\\nOn her return to the UK, she will welcome counterparts from Shanghai to the Acocks Green based Cedars Academy, with more than 1,000 teachers from across the central region registering an interest to observe ‘showcase’ lessons taught by the Chinese teachers and ask questions about the teaching approach.\\nThe Shanghai approach to the teaching of maths is based around a ‘mastery’ approach, achieved by children developing a deep, secure and fluent understanding of mathematical concepts and the ability to apply their knowledge to a variety of problems.\\nThis whole-class approach ensures that no child is left behind. Misconceptions are addressed quickly and ‘slower graspers’ are supported with catch-up sessions to ensure everyone accesses the full curriculum at the same time.\\nThe first part of the two-way trip will see Faye sit in on maths lessons at some of Shanghai’s leading schools before taking on the challenge of teaching a class herself.\\nFaye said: “It is an incredibly exciting opportunity for me to be heading off to China, I will be able to learn a lot from observing their methods and practices in person.\\n“At Cedars Academy we are constantly evaluating our educational practices in order to get the best from our pupils and looking at effective and successful approaches globally can only help that.\\n“China is renowned as a world leader in mathematics, so to be given access to classes in this particular part of the world is a real privilege.\\n“I am feeling a mixture of excitement and nerves, particularly with having to overcome the language barrier and teach maths to a class of children who speak Mandarin primarily, but from what I have been told I can expect to meet some very supportive and talented teachers.”\\nThe exchange programme was initiated by the Department for Education in 2014 after a successful period for Shanghai students in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tables, where they regularly outperformed UK pupils.\\nCedars Academy has been working with the Central Maths Hub and the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) for a number of years to develop its approach to maths teaching and learning.\\nJoe Purnell, Head Teacher at Cedars Academy, believes Faye’s visit will be beneficial not just to their children, but to others across the region.\\nHe said: “For us it is a real privilege to be able to host the return visit, we are expecting that around 1,000 teachers will want to come and observe and ask questions at the ‘showcase’ lessons in January.\\n“I have visited China in the past and seen for myself their approach to education, it is a really eye opening and thought provoking experience.\\n“I’m sure Faye will pick up on some unique aspects of their teaching and learning culture and we can’t wait for her to share her thoughts on how we can use this trip to develop our approach to maths teaching further.”',\n"," 'Edge Hill University and Tate Liverpool are to deliver a ground-breaking educational programme that uses iconic artworks in new ways. From spring 2019 the institutions will begin their Schools in Residence programme. Hosted in Tate Liverpool’s art display Ideas Depot it invites children, staff, and students from City Region schools to use the gallery as a learning resource where they will spend a week in residence and their curriculum will be delivered using exhibited artwork as a way of teaching core subjects.\\nIdeas Depot features artists such as Salvador Dali, Mona Hatoum, Henri Matisse, and Chris Ofili. It is a colourful and inviting space showing iconic paintings, sculptures, and photographs from the Tate collection of modern and contemporary art. The display has been designed by architect Sam Jacob to resemble the ways artworks might be stored, usually behind the scenes.\\nIn anticipation of each residency – with one taking place per term – the pupils and their teacher will visit behind the scenes at Tate Liverpool’s to see and select the works they would like to have on display during their residency.\\nThe display has been developed in parallel with the initial phases of research Edge Hill University Faculty of Education is undertaking with Tate Liverpool and this innovative education and community project aims to inform gallery learning approaches. The project aims to explore new ways for schools to enhance and enrich teaching and learning, and for teachers, children and their families to enjoy and develop a sense of ‘ownership’ of museum and gallery spaces.\\nThe Schools in Residence programme is the product of many months of work and pilot projects. The first phase saw 150 eight to nine year-old-children participate in workshops with Tate Liverpool artist educator Harriett Hall, programme manager, Dr Deborah Riding and Edge Hill’s Dr Helen O’Keeffe, Nichola Grimshaw and Cait Talbot Landers. Phase two involved classes from LIPA Primary School take up residency in the gallery for two weeks, experiencing their planned curriculum as usual, but delivered using many different spaces as their classroom. Students and staff from Edge Hill, Tate Liverpool and the schools involved reflected on their experiences at the end of each day and the information gathered has helped develop the model for the future Schools in Residence Programme.\\nDr Helen O’Keeffe, Associate Dean of Edge Hill’s Faculty of Education, said: “Ideas Depot is an exciting and innovative display which it is hoped will support teachers, children and their families to connect with new and different artworks, seeing how they link to their own lives and school curriculum. The residencies are being developed as a response to the external funding pressures on arts subjects in the curriculum and this helps us to explore a sustainable model where arts learning is embedded into planning. We want teachers to feel confident in using the gallery independently and in creative ways in their teaching.”\\nDr Deborah Riding, Programme Manager, Children and Young People, Tate Liverpool added: “Ideas Depot is a very special display at Tate Liverpool that inspires primary aged children to make connections between artworks, their imaginations, and the curriculum. The display also demonstrates the power of collaboration and the exchange of ideas and knowledge.

In fact, the sooner you familiarise yourself with your options, the more relaxed you’ll feel about the whole process. And hopefully you’ll be better placed to make the right decisions about an important phase in your life.\\nIt is a complex issue, so to try to help avoid confusion, here we look at what you need to consider ensuring you’re not left short in retirement.\\nContracting out\\nUntil April 2016 the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS) and Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) automatically contracted members out of the Additional State Pension – allowing both employer and employee to pay lower national insurance contributions (NICs). The State Pension and Additional State Pension have now been replaced by the new flat rate State Pension.\\nOnly those with 35 years of qualifying NICs will be entitled to the full flat rate pension (currently £164.35 per week). You will need to make sure you know whether you qualify so that you can make accurate calculations about your retirement income. If you have been ‘contracted out’, this will also be taken into account when the rate is calculated.\\nSomeone who was contracted out will still have received qualifying years of NICs for each of the years they were earning. However, as they have paid a reduced rate of NICs, this will be taken into account when working out their new single tier pension starting amount.\\nThis is why there can be some confusion. It can look as if you are not receiving the ‘full’ state pension, but in practice the ‘missing’ amount is made up in the benefits from your contracted out pension. This is known as COPE (Contracted Out Pension Equivalent), and when added to your reduced starting amount of state pension, it is broadly equivalent to the full starting amount.\\nIt is important to ensure you have amassed enough qualifying years. If you are unsure, you can check your National Insurance record at www.gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record to see if there are any gaps. You may then be able to apply for credits to fill these gaps.\\nTopping up\\nIf it looks like you won’t have the required 35 qualifying years by the time you retire, don’t worry, there are still steps you can take.\\nDepending when the gap occurred it may be possible for you to make voluntary NI contributions to fill gaps in your National Insurance record. An additional year’s NI contribution can be bought for roughly £760, which could increase an annual pension income by more than £245 a year. Over the course of 20 years, this could be worth as much as £4,900.\\nBuying five year’s contributions for a little less than £4,000 could potentially benefit a retiree with an additional £24,500 of pension income over 20 years. However, additional contributions can’t be made if you have achieved 35 years’ service or if you are on track to reach this number of years.\\nWhile the initial cost may put some people off, in the long term it can help you achieve your retirement goal, and is still good value when compared to buying a private pension to help you close the gap.\\nPlanning ahead\\nOn average, teachers think they need an income of £25,056* a year to live comfortably, but government figures show the average income of all pensioners is only £15,964** a year. But addressing your pension shortfall early can help to close this gap.\\nAs we continue to live longer, it’s important that the money we have lasts us. Many people are now living for 30 years or more after retiring, therefore it’s vital that your money and assets can last as long as you do.\\nWhile monthly expenditures tend to decrease during retirement – mortgages are usually paid off and children have normally left home – it’s important to factor in that private care may be needed further down the line. As older generations live longer, many retired people are also finding they need to contribute towards the care costs of their parents.\\nIf you’re unsure, get advice\\nState pensions can be confusing, and any changes to the system only adds to their complexity.\\nTo make sure teachers are well informed about their retirement future, Wesleyan is holding seminars across the UK, where our Wesleyan Financial Services Consultants will be on hand to explain the changes, answer questions, and offer advice.\\nSpeaking to a Financial Consultant whose expertise lies within the teaching profession will ensure that you can make the right choices when it comes to retirement, maximising your assets and making sure that you can live comfortably.\\n* Research based on a survey of 101 teachers, by Censuswide on behalf of Wesleyan, January 2017.\\n** Figure from Department of Work & Pensions Pensioners’ Incomes Series, June 2016.\\nWesleyan Financial Services provides specialist financial advice to teachers, doctors, dentists and lawyers.\\nFor more information about financial advice, speak to a Financial Consultant go to www.wesleyan.co.uk or call 0800 092 1990.',\n"," 'Official statistics released yesterday (Monday 12 Nov) show that one in six young people between 10 and 15 years old reported being bullied.\\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT said: “The government’s cuts to school budgets are bad news for children who are being bullied.\\n“School staff are the first line of defence against bullying and they are the best way of making sure it doesn’t happen in the first place. But NAHT’s research into school budgets shows that more than a third of schools (37%) have had to reduce the number or hours of teaching staff.\\n“Teaching assistants and pastoral staff in schools also play a vital role in managing behaviour, but more than four fifths (86%) of school leaders have reduced the hours or numbers of support staff because of the cuts. Almost two thirds (65%) of the NAHT members who responded to our survey said that they strongly agreed these reductions have resulted in a negative impact on their school.\\n“Of particular concern to us is the fact that pupils with additional needs and from lower incomes are the once most likely to report that they are being bullied. But efforts to step in, so that every child has an equal chance to succeed, are being hampered by the cuts to budgets.\\n“Pupils thrive when they have a great environment to learn in. That environment is created by the skilled professionals employed by the school. Many of these professionals are having their hours cut because school budgets are at breaking point, and there’s no sign of any extra money coming from the Treasury, which is a disaster for young people who are feeling bullied at school.”',\n"," 'In 1918 Gresham’s headmaster George Howson announced that the newly built school Chapel would be furnished with a memorial to the students and staff who died fighting in WWI: a stained glass window designed by Reginald Otto Bell; and the names of the fallen carved and gilded into a six-panel memorial board. 100 years later, Gresham’s has raised £8,000 for a new memorial stone, which includes the names of 15 students and staff who were omitted from the original memorial.\\nSimon Kinder, Gresham’s Head of History who has been involved in the project, explains: “The names were omitted either as a result of having only been discovered more recently, thanks to further research, or as a result of the students and staff members having moved away to other schools and institutions and therefore being included on memorials elsewhere. Some of the missing names were initially discovered by our former Deputy Head, Sue Smart, who published a poignant book about the fallen – When Heroes Die – in 2001. The book, which was reprinted in 2014, gives our school a connection with our past that few other schools are likely to have, and for that we are incredibly grateful to Sue.\\n“Building on Sue’s findings, I undertook further research, comparing our original school registers with the CWGC database, newspaper archives and family history and military online resources,steered by our school archivist Liz Larby. Committed to the philosophy that archives need to be educationally relevant, Liz has supported every aspect of our wider centenary project since 2014, including leading a group of student researchers every Friday afternoon in the task of creating profiles of the fallen men, all of which can be found in the Roll of Honour section of our dedicated WWI Memorial Website.”\\nThe combination of staff and student efforts has resulted in the school discovering 15 names – the original memorial board depicted 99 students and one member of staff and the school now knows the names of 112 students and three members of staff – which will be included on the new memorial board. The largest donation towards the £8,000 needed for the new stone was given by the Gresham’s Foundation, with further support received from the Old Greshamiam Club and wider school community. A special effort was made by former Director of Music at Gresham’s, Angela Dugdale, for organising a WWI concert, 1914-1918 Never Such Innocence, Gresham’s at War in words and music. Proceeds from the concert, alongside £10 sales of a CD recorded in the school’s Fishmongers’ Recital Room by Robert FitzGerald, with tenor Christopher Barnes and pianoforte Philip Adam titled We do not forget, were donated to the memorial stone fund.\\nGresham’s Headmaster, Douglas Robb, said: “In a service held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Chapel, in 2016, we remembered that the building stands as a memorial to those from the school community whose lives began here but were tragically cut short by war. The Roll of Honour of the 115 fallen students and staff was read out and, for each name, a member of the school’s current Combined Cadet Force solemnly left the building. The empty seats portrayed a haunting image to those present. As part of our four year focus on the centenary, we have paused and remembered each one of our fallen, as close as we can to the centenary of their death, with specially commissioned paper lanterns lit as a symbol of Hope and Peace, and 115 stories told since the project began in 2014.\\n“The City of Peace stained glass window bears the inscription “They whom this window commemorates were numbered among those who, at the call of King and Country, left all that was dear to them, endured hardness, faced danger and finally passed out of the sight of men by the path of duty and sacrifice, giving up their lives that others may live in freedom. Let those who come after see to it that their names be not forgotten.” I am so thankful to our students, to Simon and Liz, to Sue, and everyone else who has supported this project. It gives all of us such a tangible way to mark the centenary of the end of the Great War, as well as a renewed determination to play our part in maintaining peace.”',\n"," 'Clare Dunne (Prince Hal) and Jade Anouka (Hotspur) in Henry IV – Photo by Helen Maybanks\\nDirected by Phyllida Lloyd, the ground-breaking trilogy which includes Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest is now available for secondary schools to watch across the UK via the free national service.

More than 45 CELTA centres hosted parties for their CELTA staff, alumni and current CELTA trainees.\\nEstablished in September 1988 by Cambridge Assessment English, CELTA is a qualification for teachers of English as a foreign language. Based on an intensive four-week course, or more extended part-time study, it combines theoretical study with assessed practical teaching experience. CELTA courses are available at over 300 approved centres in more than 70 countries.\\nBlandine Bastie, Country Head (UK and Ireland), Cambridge Assessment English, says: “Over the past 30 years CELTA has become very highly regarded across the globe, and this is thanks to our dedicated tutors who teach the qualification year after year, and the bright trainees who use their CELTA qualification to teach English as a foreign language all over the world. We wanted to take this opportunity to celebrate with our centres. From London to Dublin to Malta, the birthday parties truly represent the strong international reputation that CELTA upholds.”\\nDavid Riddell, a CELTA trainer at International House London, the renowned language school that played the leading role in the development of the qualification that became CELTA, said: “I have been teaching on CELTA courses for 30 years, and on every course I do it is inspiring to see our trainees develop their teaching skills as they progress through the course. Whether they use the qualification to seek work as an English language teacher in the UK, or go off to teach in other countries, it is always incredibly rewarding to see trainees go on to apply what they have learnt on their CELTA course to the benefit of English-language learners around the world. Through the 30th birthday party, Cambridge Assessment English has given us the opportunity to bring our community together and celebrate with current staff, trainees, students and alumni. We all look forward to the next 30 years of CELTA!”\\nCELTA is highly regarded internationally and, according to recent research which looked at requirements for English language teaching (ELT) jobs around the world, CELTA is the qualification most often requested by employers. The study revealed that CELTA is requested by 71.5 percent of ELT employers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, compared to just 23.6 percent asking for CELTA’s nearest equivalent the Trinity CertTESOL. The data from the study further revealed that, in the UK, 88 percent of jobs that require an ELT qualification specifically ask for a CELTA qualification.',\n"," 'A new Teacher Training Centre has been opened by Chris Heaton-Harris MP at Guilsborough Academy which aims to address the national shortage of teachers.\\nThe building, which is located at the front of Guilsborough Academy, was created by converting an old caretaker’s house on the premises.

It teaches you independence to do something that makes a difference.”\\nScholars attended a two-day gathering in Nottingham, bringing together future teachers from across the country to learn the crucial skills needed to become highly skilled quality teachers, such as how to make Mathematics more engaging, conflict resolution and how to manage behaviour in the classroom.\\nEmily Giubertoni from the Bishop Challoner Regional Training Centre in Birmingham, who also ran a popular behaviour management and conflict resolution session at the conference,said: “Future Teaching Scholars programme participants are particularly unique. Most of them start age 18 or 19 and so have real energy. It’s really inspirational to see the journey they go through – moving from shaking for five minutes when they start, right through to leading a Maths or Science class at the age of 20. The programme is amazingly rich for people who are teaching as well, they can share their expertise and their experience. At Bishop Challoner, we’ve used it as a tool for teachers to develop themselves and go beyond the classroom.”\\nMore on Future Teaching Scholars can be found here:\\nhttps://www.futureteachingscholars.com',\n"," 'The Creative Learning Guild,\\xa0a charity based in Yorkshire which supports the grassroots creative learning movement across the UK, has announced today that nominations are open for the new National Creative Learning Awards.\\nThe new national Creative Learning Awards will celebrate the inspirational innovators, educators and practitioners who live and breathe creative learning.

We know that 90% of teachers who got involved in 2017 said that children were more engaged in their learning and 72% said that they were better able to concentrate after learning outdoors. As mental health challenges rise and pressures on children and young people increase, it becomes more and more vital that we harness these easy-to-achieve benefits.\\n“Between our 2017 campaign and May 2018, one fifth of teachers in the UK and ROI told us they had increased time for outdoor play since taking part in the campaign, with two fifths increasing outdoor learning time.

We want to use this as an opportunity to connect children to the environment and encourage them to nurture the nature around them.”\\nAlthough some schools are on half term on 1 November, the campaign still invites them to register and simply go outdoors on a day that suits them.

These type of outdoor shelters typically are constructed of a roof system with supporting legs and in certain cases, either full length roll-down canvas panels or solid timber infill panels to afford that extra bit of protection from the weather. The shelters we offer at the Hideout House Company have a variety of roofs a school can choose from and these are namely high quality grade PU coated canvas, felt shingle tiles or cedar shingle tiles. These shelters are available in either octagonal, square or rectangular shape formats.\\nOutdoor Classroom\\nThese are defined as the popular and classic open-sided gazebo style outdoor classrooms which are used for either shade and shelter (as listed above) or more typically as a building to be used by a school class for outdoor learning. The most popular shape is octagonal as it is easier to teach from a position at the front but again they are also available in either square or rectangular formats. They can also be used as parent waiting shelters.\\nWith regards to sizes, a 5m octagonal classroom will be used to accommodate a class of 30 children whereas a smaller one at 4m will cater for 22 children. Building wise, you can then add in various options such as solid infill wall panels, toughened glass or polycarbonate windows, access ramp, opening and closing upper louvre panels, roll-down canvas panels and door, atrium roof to allow in lots of natural light from above, trellis panels, 50% anti-slip grip decking, built in bench storage units, inter post desks and seats and even totally enclose it with glass and French doors. We can even put in two tier amphitheatre-style seating.\\nThen we have various eco options such as a roof guttering and water butt system (for rainwater harvesting), living sedum roof, educational wind turbine, solar panel, energy monitoring board with two power sockets which the children can use to power up laptops, visualisers etc, electricity producing dynamo bikes which the children pedal to create power, planters and bird boxes\\xa0– see link below for further details on these.\\nhttp://www.hideouthouse.com/portfolio-item/interesting-optional-extras/\\nEnclosed Outdoor Classrooms\\nThese buildings are, as the name suggests, fully enclosed so that they can be used all year round and in all weathers. They are used in instances where a school wants 365 days usage and can also used as outdoor libraries, break-out nurture rooms for special one to one pupil tuition, community rooms or even as temporary classroom buildings.\\nA school has the option to fully insulate them and in the majority of cases, they fall under 30m2 as building regulation approval does not have to be sought for buildings of this size. The rectangular and square options can also feature bi-fold doors to the front elevation so that one side can be fully opened up to allow for a natural free-flow from outdoors to inside and vice versa.\\nAn interesting addition to this range is our outdoor classroom pod which is a pre-manufactured unit which comes delivered pre-assembled on the back of a low loader truck and is then either towed or craned into position. It has an attractive large circular Hobbit-style door and a round window on the back wall to add a bit of extra creative flair. A school has the option to have it fully insulated and with an electrics pack including lighting and heating.\\nFire Pit Shelters\\nThe forest school programme is becoming increasingly popular and one of the key skills children learn is lighting fires and outdoor cooking. And they also need to have some kind of shelter in the designated forest school area. We have therefore combined these two requirements into one product which is the fire pit shelter and fire pit/cooking cabin.\\nThe fire pit shelter has a special roof with a ventilation hole to let the fire smoke exhaust upwards and a special two tier roof cowl which stops the rain getting through.

The tour is accompanied by a learning programme which includes professional development for teachers led by the NT and Curious Incident movement directors Frantic Assembly, as well as curriculum-based resources and workshops.\\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time brings Mark Haddon’s best-selling novel to life on stage, adapted by two-time Olivier Award-winning playwright Simon Stephens and directed by Olivier and Tony Award®‑winning director Marianne Elliott. The novel has won more than 17 literary awards and is widely studied in schools. Simon Stephens’ adaptation is a set text for GCSE English Literature.\\nThe play tells the story of Christopher John Francis Boone, who is fifteen years old. He stands besides Mrs Shears’ dead dog, Wellington, who has been speared with a garden fork, it is seven minutes after midnight and Christopher is under suspicion. He records each fact in a book he is writing to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington. He has an extraordinary brain, and is exceptional at maths while ill-equipped to interpret everyday life. He has never ventured alone beyond the end of his road, he detests being touched and distrusts strangers. But his detective work, forbidden by his father, takes him on a frightening journey that upturns his world.\\nSpeaking about the schools tour Simon Stephens said: “It means the world to me that Curious Incident will be touring schools around the country. I worked as a schoolteacher teaching kids in Dagenham in Essex 20 years ago. I loved it. I still think of myself as a teacher. I have seen firsthand how inspiring drama is to young people in schools. I believe the arts to be fundamental to our society. We can’t afford to lose them from our education system. I am delighted that our play will play its part in introducing young people to the theatre. I always hoped that Curious Incident was a play that could be performed anywhere, by anyone. The play is designed to provoke and inspire imagination and interpretation in its staging and inspiration in its audience. The tour will, I hope, provide the same kind of imagination and inspiration throughout the country.”\\nAlice King-Farlow, Director of Learning at the National Theatre said, “At the National Theatre we believe that all young people should have the opportunity to experience and participate in drama no matter where they are in the UK. We’re delighted to be touring this award-winning play to schools, and via our Theatre Nation Partnerships, we hope that bringing Simon Stephen’s brilliant Curious Incident to young audiences across the country will help to spark imaginations and encourage participation in theatre”.',\n"," 'The V&A recently announced that over 60 objects will travel to five locations across England from September 2018 to support the teaching of art, design and technology in secondary schools, as part of its educational initiative DesignLab Nation.

If we care about social mobility, wellbeing and economic growth – and if we want our creative industries to continue to flourish – we urgently need to rebalance our education system so that the arts are valued just as much as other subjects.”\\nDirector of the V&A Tristram Hunt said: “As our creative economy grows, international competition accelerates, and the provision of creative subjects in schools is squeezed, art and design education is needed more than ever. By bringing together local industry, museums and schools, DesignLab Nation will ensure that the V&A works with communities across the country to educate and inspire the artists, innovators and designers of tomorrow.”\\nDesignLab Nation brings together secondary schools, local museums and locally based industry and designers to inspire and preserve the essential role of Art, Design and Technology education.

The children were then invited to handle some animal artefacts before enjoying the walking safari tour with two knowledgeable guides.\\nChristine Braithwaite, Area Manager for Beanstalk North West, said: “It has been a fantastic series of events so far and we are really lucky to be teaming up with the wonderful people at Knowsley Safari to offer such an exciting outdoor learning experience for the children. For many of the schools we work with, funded opportunities like these do not come up very often, so to be able to take the children on a learning experience beyond the limitations of the classroom is just fantastic. We are really grateful to Knowsley Safari for hosting the visits and also to Manchester Islamic Girls School who helped fund the trips, as did two private donors who covered the costs of the buses and the cost of an ice-cream for each of the children. Thanks to their generosity these children had such a special day and got so much out of the whole experience. We are really looking forward to more special projects as part of the partnership.”\\nKnowsley Safari’s Learning and Discovery Community Officer, Hayley Worsfold, says: “We always aim to develop new and exciting ways to connect people with the natural world. At Knowsley Safari, we pride ourselves on providing opportunities for members of the community most at need and our partnership with Beanstalk helps us to further achieve this.\\n“The children from all three of the schools we’ve worked with so far have worked so hard to develop their literacy skills and in recognition of this, were invited to enjoy the reading within the natural surroundings at Knowsley Safari.”\\nDebbie McConlough, Assistant Head Teacher at Hope Primary School, said: “The children and staff enjoyed themselves immensely and were so excited to tell everybody about it when they got back to school. They felt very special to have been picked and I think it gave them a real self-esteem boost.”\\nIf you would like to find out more about supporting the charity, having Beanstalk volunteers in your school, or becoming a trained reading helper yourself, please visit the Beanstalk website to find out all about how to get involved: www.beanstalkcharity.org.uk.',\n"," 'Shakespeare Schools Foundation (SSF) has been awarded the Grant for Young Artists in the 30th anniversary year of The Praemium Imperiale.\\nAwarded by the Imperial Family of Japan on behalf of the Japan Arts Association, the global arts prize includes five categories not covered by The Nobel Prize – painting, sculpture, architecture, music, theatre and film. The prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions to the development and promotion of the arts.\\nSSF uses the unique power of Shakespeare to transform lives. At its core is the world’s largest youth drama Festival. Every year, Shakespeare Schools Festival unites up to 30,000 young people from all backgrounds and abilities in a journey that increases confidence, resilience and teamwork, giving thousands of young people from across the UK the crucial skills they need to succeed in life. The six month process culminates in exhilarating performance nights from primary, secondary and special educational needs schools at up to 136 theatres nationwide, every autumn.\\nThis year marks SSF’s 18th birthday and the charity is celebrating working with 300,000 young people since it was established in 2000.\\nLast year, SSF reported that, as a result of taking part in the Festival: 99% of teachers agree that their students’ confidence increased, 90% of teachers said that their students were more enthusiastic about school and learning and 93% of students said that they enjoy working as a team more.\\nThe announcement of the award came on Wednesday 11 July in the Royal Academy’s new Benjamin West Theatre. Festival schools, St Marylebone School and Greenfields Primary School, performed vignettes from Hamlet and Julius Caesar to an audience including The Japanese Ambassador to the UK and Lord Patten of Barnes, the UK’s International Advisor to the award.\\nChief Executive Ruth Brock said: “On behalf of Shakespeare Schools Foundation I am deeply honoured to accept the Grant for Young Artists Award. Shakespeare is the birthright of every child. His extraordinary works with their universal themes and beautiful language can, with the right help, belong to everyone. With SSF, children make friends, do better in class and gain the skills they need for life. Further than that, art transcends borders, heals divisions, nurtures empathy and collaboration. And as the world’s greatest playwright, Shakespeare teaches us all more about what it means to be human.\\nIn our 18th birthday year, this is a wonderful recognition of SSF’s work so far. We are deeply grateful to the Japan Art Association and are strengthened in our determination to ensure we continue to use Shakespeare to transform children’s lives.”\\nCharity patron Jamila Gavin who attended the morning’s announcement said: “Whenever children come into contact with Shakespeare, beyond the textbook and into performance, it is a revelation for them. No longer is it some writer of the distant past placed on a pedestal by some elite, but a man whose ideas and perceptions are constantly relevant to everyone and anyone, at any age, from any background and any culture. This is why Shakespeare Schools Foundation is so valuable and so exciting – and nothing is more exciting than seeing young people bringing fresh interpretations to plays which, of all that has ever been written in the English language, demonstrates the universality of the human condition. I am proud to be a patron of a charity that is ensuring that the next generation, no matter their ability, can experience Shakespeare in such a real and relevant way.”\\nSSF has to raise £1 million each year to continue its work.

The school caters for students aged 11 – 19 years.\\nThe school has been working hard over recent years in collaboration with The Rotary Club of Stockport Lamplighter to ‘rewild’ an area of the school field to help the school become a Forest School.\\nForest School is an approach to teaching and learning that allows all students develop a wide range of skills and to improve their self-confidence and self-esteem through hands on experiences in natural environments with trees.\\nThe volunteers from the Buckingham Group, McGinley, Network Rail and East-Tec Electrical Services helped to take the project onto the next stage, by donating their time and materials.\\nThe volunteers enlarged the ‘firepit’ area in the grounds and created a path to improve access to the wild area and also installed new lighting to the garden area.\\nHeadteacher at the Heaton School, Jo Chambers-Shirley said: “For medical, physical and sometimes emotional reasons, many of our students miss out on accessing wilderness areas. To have an area on site accessible and available for our students to enjoy therefore greatly enriches their lives.\\n“Through Forest School activities I have seen many students, and particularly those with the most complex needs, blossom and their self-esteem and mental well being improve.

It forms part of DEFRA’s pledge to support schools to plant 1 million trees by 2020.\\nWorking with the Woodland Trust, who are leading on delivery targeted at some of the most deprived areas of the country, England’s Community Forests are working together to hit the target of helping primary schools plant 164,000 trees, and with another two years to run on the project, they are well on their way.\\nSince the project began around 11 000 children from 350 schools have planted 65 000 trees and a cost-benefit analysis has evaluated the social and environmental impacts of the financial and human resources invested by Trees for Learning at the end of its second year at a staggering £18.3m.\\nTeachers reported increased knowledge of the natural environment, increased levels of physical activity and improved behaviour of children. Eighty percent of schools specified a major impact on improving the children’s outdoor learning.\\nStaff from Community Forests all over the country help schools decide what to plant and where by providing expert design advice. They then help schools to run planting days with children to ensure that the right type of trees go in the right places, maximising the chance of them being part of the landscape for generations to come.\\nChildren all have the opportunity to plant a tree and watch them grow, and take part in activities to learn more about trees and woodlands, linked to the national curriculum. The planting days enable children living in urban areas to connect with nature in their local environment, learn about how trees link with other important issues like health and climate change, and create settings for outdoor learning and Forest Schools. Children plant a range of native broadleaves, fruit trees and conifers along with ‘useful trees’ such as willow and dogwood which can be used as art and craft resources. They learn the best way to plant, look after (and importantly for a generation we are often told spends less and less time outdoors), how to identify these trees when out and about.\\nMersey Forest’s Trees for Learning project officer Steph Hepworth said, “Planting trees has a special significance for children in schools as many of them will be around to see their tree growing as they move up through the school. This helps to give them a sense of belonging to their surroundings and fosters a desire to nurture their environment. When we plant with the Year 6 children some of them feel sad that they won’t be around to see their tree come to maturity, but take great comfort from the thought younger siblings or friends will take care of it.”\\nThe tree planting sessions give staff the opportunity to discuss biodiversity with the children: prompting them to consider what creatures will live in the hedgerows they’re now planting and how they could encourage more wildlife into their school environment. The work links to the national curriculum encouraging discussions about how trees and the environment are part of other important issues like health and climate change.\\nFeedback from the sessions has been extremely positive. One teacher reported, “I really noticed a change in one boy in particular who struggles with motor skills. He doesn’t enjoy activities such as PE and handwriting but was really enthusiastic about the tree planting. He chose to plant one of the bigger trees which meant digging a bigger hole and did not stop until he had achieved this.”\\nFollow up work is a crucial aspect of the project. When the team from the Mersey Forest revisited a school site to deliver the education follow-on sessions, they noticed that one area of woodland was being used by children during their lunchtime break and that some of the saplings were being inadvertently damaged.\\nDuring the education follow up session children expressed their concern about the trees and a desire to prevent further damage. After discussion with the children and staff, the team returned to the school and installed some stakes and mowed pathways to help to guide the children to take a fixed path through the area. Children also designed and made signs to educate their peers as to how to care for their woodlands via an assembly. The intention is to still allow the children to use the area but to ensure that the woodland has the chance to become established in the vital first years.\\nAnother element of the follow up work sees children using survey methods to monitor their woodland. The activities are closely linked to the national curriculum and include identifying tree type, (deciduous/evergreen), notes on tree health and numbers and an estimate of tree size. The children survey an area of their new woodland using marked out quadrats (25m²) and report back their findings, before suggesting ways to fix any problems and planning their future use of the area. Monitoring will be ongoing for 2 years following the scheme, with schools given the opportunity to plant further trees should they wish to.\\nThe next round of planting days with children will begin in the autumn and run into early spring 2019. If you know of a school who might like to be involved in the project contact your local community forest and ask to speak to Trees for Learning.\\n@TreesForLearning merseyforest.org.uk communityforest.org.uk',\n"," 'IDPE Awards Dinner 2018Hilton Metropole Birmingham11.06.18©Steve PopeFotowales\\nSchools’ development teams are transforming the lives of young people every day.

The Institute for Research in Schools (IRIS) partnered with researchers at the University of Oxford on a project to analyse tracks from the ATLAS detector at CERN. Students analysed images and created posters on their results. They were then invited to then present their work to academics at the University. They also had a tour of the Oxford Physics Department, sat in on lectures, gained advice on applying to university and they stayed in Merton College.\\nWithin the Higgs Hunters project students learned about research being conducted at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland\\nThrough the initial Zooniverse Higgs Hunters project, members of the public flagged over one million interesting locations in images of CERN collisions while hunting for so-called “Baby Higgs” bosons. These are exotic particles which some scientists believe may form when a Higgs particle decays. Groups of students working with IRIS then further analysed the images to ascertain the reliability of the public’s classifications and enhance the analysis by inspired use of new algorithms and data analysis techniques.\\nStudents who submitted impressive posters on their work were given the opportunity to present their research at the University of Oxford and to meet Professor Alan Barr and his team. The trip included a number of practical sessions and in depth discussions on the students work by academics who attended their poster presentation.\\nOf the trip, the students have said: “It gave me a chance to do proper physics and learn new skills. This has shown me the challenge and opportunities in research.”\\nProfessor Alan Barr, who helped initiate the Higgs Hunters project, remarked that: “My colleagues and I have been incredibly impressed with the research that the students presented. We could never have imagined when this project started that we would see such a rich range of scientifically interesting topics being explored!\\nThe director of IRIS, Professor Becky Parker, said: “IRIS aims to offer young people opportunities to contribute to cutting edge research. With Higgs Hunters the students came up with ideas and approaches which interested and delighted the academics showing how innovative young people can be and how well they respond to opportunities where they can flourish doing real science.”\\nFor more information on the Institute for Research in Schools (IRIS) and the Higgs Hunters project, please visit the IRIS website www.researchinschools.org/higgs_hunters/home.html',\n"," 'A new framework which aims to enhance scholarship in the college higher education sector has been launched today.\\nThe Scholarship Framework is the main output from the Scholarship Project, led by the Association of Colleges and funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England.

Having worked together throughout the year, those schools now benefiting from the Transition Support module are Avenue End Primary School and Sunnyside Primary School in Craigend, Caledonia Primary School in Ballieston, Sandaig Primary School and Royston Primary in the East End, Cranhill Primary, Wallacewell Primary in Robroyston, Carntyne Primary and Wellshot Primary in Tollcross.\\nThe Let’s Talk transition support offers a range of interventions to ensure that no youngster that is anxious about going to high school falls through the cracks. The programme, run by the social care charity, includes eight classroom lessons around mental health, with additional group work in school for children who have been identified as struggling with the change.\\nAlongside classes on transition support, a major part of the work carried out by Quarriers’ Let’s Talk Service is a weekly group which brings together children over the summer holidays to take part in group activities, allowing them to make new friends ahead of school starting and iron out any worries together.\\nAndrea McGowan, Quarriers Let’s Talk Project Worker said: “In our pilot year in 2016, we worked with three primary schools in the east end of Glasgow – Avenue End Primary School, Caledonia Primary School and Sandaig Primary School. Our days out in the summer holidays gave children the chance to meet up and make friends ensuring they would know a familiar face when school started in August.”\\nTwo boys who hadn’t been identified as being apprehensive about the move and appeared confident in school were also found to be struggling to get their heads around the transition.\\nAndrea said: “During the leavers’ ceremony both boys were upset and within an hour of school finishing for summer, both boys visited my office asking to speak to me. We organised that they attend the weekly summer activity group and they both seemed to get a lot out of it.\\n“After the summer, they started high school. One of the boys still visits us now and again for a chat. He talks about the friends he made at the group and his plans for a weekend away with them. His visits are much less frequent but he knows that if he needs support, he can pop into the office at any time.\\n“Mental health amongst youngsters has really come to the fore making Let’s Talk such an important initiative. What makes this job so rewarding is helping these youngsters to face their fears and show them what they are capable of. Being a guiding hand and a reassuring presence during a time of change is vital and can make a real difference.”\\nOne of the boys felt so empowered by the support he received he let Andrea know he wants to work for Quarriers in the future to give other children the same support.\\nWith its Let’s Talk Service, and the transition support in particular, Quarriers hopes that primary seven children will have the opportunity to explore their concerns about moving on and reach a point where they can feel excited about this next chapter.\\nTo find out more about Quarriers Let’s Talk Service and how pupils in your community can benefit from tailored mental health support during the 2018-2019 academic year, please email letstalk@quarriers.org.uk or visit https://quarriers.org.uk/how-we-help/children-families/lets-talk-about-mental-health/',\n"," 'Year 6 pupils from Tollesbury Primary School in Essex recently got hands-on experience of a career in engineering at a special event hosted by a local engineering company.\\nFamily-run Gibbons Engineering Group welcomed 23 children to its offices and workshops as part of its Year of Engineering 2018 partnership.\\nThe Year of Engineering scheme is a government-led initiative to encourage young people to consider a career in engineering, and Gibbons arranged a number of activities designed to give the children a taste of the variety and challenges offered by the industry.\\nAfter being shown round Gibbons’ workshops and seeing engineers building control panels and repairing electric motors, the children were divided into two groups for the four activities.\\nThe first activity saw the children identify places within the home where electric motors and pumps are used. Following this, the pupils built a motorised model car in small groups, which required them to follow instructions and work as a team.\\nThe children also got the opportunity to build their own electric motor with a battery, paper clips, magnets and copper wire. Finally, they created a simple water pump from a bottle, straw and a balloon – a task which was so popular that the school is planning to demonstrate it to its Early Years pupils.\\nOnce all activities had been completed, the children were presented with certificates and goody bags before returning to school.\\nTollesbury Primary School Class Teacher Amanda Tomkins said: “I was in awe of the activities… the children relished the opportunities to get hands on and creative.

It will test whether policies to improve air quality, such as London’s new Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), are associated with improved growth of children’s lungs and reduced chest symptoms. Researchers from the University of Bedfordshire and Queen Mary University of London are currently recruiting schools to take part.\\nChildren are especially vulnerable to traffic pollution, with evidence showing stunted growth of children’s lungs in polluted areas worldwide, leaving them at risk of lifelong breathing disorders and earlier death. Pollution also triggers asthma, asthma attacks and chest infections.\\nLead researcher Professor Chris Griffiths from Queen Mary University of London said: “Air pollution in UK towns and cities is a major health problem, and this study is the first in the world to test the impact of targeted pollution control measures on the long-term lung growth and health of children.\\n“Low emission zones are being promoted as the best way to tackle traffic pollution and are common across Europe. If ambitious enough they can improve air quality, but we don’t know whether they benefit health. This study will tell us whether this type of low emission zone improves children’s lung growth and development, and whether they should be implemented in towns and cities in the UK and globally.”\\nBavaani Nanthabalan, Headteacher at Netley Primary School in the London Borough of Camden which is taking part in the study, said: “Air pollution is a major worry for parents in London. We’re delighted to be helping to answer these important questions about children’s health and development.”\\nLondon has some of the worst air pollution in Europe and the upcoming ULEZ is the central component of the city’s air quality strategy. Starting in April 2019, the introduction of the zone provides a unique opportunity for researchers to test how effectively the policy reduces air pollution, improves lung growth and reduces the number of chest infections and asthma attacks. The researchers will also find out if improving air quality encourages children to spend more time exercising outdoors.\\nThe researchers will compare the health of two large groups of primary school children (aged 6–9 years). 1,500 children will come from central London primary schools where the ULEZ will be implemented, and 1,500 children from primary schools in Luton, a large town close to London with a broadly similar population and air quality.\\nThe children will have an annual health check for four years that includes measuring the size and function of their lungs by blowing into a machine called a spirometer. They can also wear an activity monitor. With the family’s permission, the team will also check children’s health records to find out how often they’ve had respiratory infections, visited a GP or A&E, or been admitted to hospital for chest problems.\\nThe team will monitor accurately the air pollution to which each child has been exposed over the four years, including exposures to a range of key pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulates such as PM2.5 and PM10.\\nProfessor Frank Kelly from King’s College London said: “London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone is a bold and world-leading initiative with the potential for big impacts on London’s air quality and the health of London’s children. It is important that it’s rigorously evaluated.”\\nProfessor Gurch Randhawa from the University of Bedfordshire said: “We urgently need to know whether our public health policies on air pollution are effective. This timely study enables us to measure accurately their impact on children’s health.”\\nProfessor Martin White, Director of the NIHR Public Health Research Programme said: “NIHR funds research to evaluate major policies that may have an impact on population health. The London Ultra Low Emissions Zone is just such a policy and this research should help inform future action to tackle poor air quality.”\\nThe CHILL collaboration brings together experts from six globally leading research centres – Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, MRC and Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma, NIHR Health Protection Unit in the Health Impact of Environmental Hazards, MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health, UKCRC Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), Cambridge, and The Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California.',\n"," 'A unique set of teaching materials, designed to weave education against single-use plastic into the national curriculum for 11-16 year olds, has been launched today, World Oceans Day, June 8th, by Plastic Oceans UK, in a bid to educate and empower children to become ambassadors for change.\\nPlastic Oceans UK is the team behind the ground-breaking film A Plastic Ocean, which first raised awareness of the terrible consequences single-use plastic was having on the environment when it was released in 2016. As part of the film’s legacy programme, one of the film researchers, Jessica Hickie, has spent the last two years developing the ‘Wave One’ lesson plans, with materials that can seamlessly fit into seven IGCSE syllabus subjects.\\nJessica says, “As a science teacher, I know delivering the national curriculum is very pressurised so there is little or no spare time to prepare materials to teach extra-curricular subjects, regardless of how important or passionate you are about them. For this teaching material to make an impact it was imperative that it could replace existing lessons by delivering the required outcomes stated in the national curriculum.\\n“Each lesson is differentiated to three different learning levels and contains the terminology for each target age group so there is no additional work required by the teachers. We have been successfully trialling the material in Brannel School, St Austell, and the response from both teachers and students has been overwhelmingly positive.”\\nThe new Teaching materials are geared towards Key Stages 3 and 4, and are available to download for free from June 8th at www.plasticoceans.uk.\\nThe packs are currently available in English and French, and can be used in Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Geography, Maths, English Language and Design Technology.

The boats themselves will then be recycled after the attempt has been made, showing the importance of reusing and recycling materials.\\nThe Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge is intended to demonstrate the impact that plastic bottle waste can have on the environment. Participating schools have access to a hub of resources for teachers to support learning centred around the issues of plastic pollution in the oceans, the environment, recycling and the circular economy and all educators are invited to contribute or use the resources available to support their school’s curriculum.\\nThe Guinness World Record attempt follows a similar attempt achieved, in the development of the project, by the pupils at St. James’ Church of England Academy in Bournemouth, with the support of the Queen Mary Sailing Club. 330 plastic bottle boats were successfully launched, officially setting a new world record, and recycled. What began in one school has now been taken up by over 60 schools, with more than 6,000 pupils and over 300 teachers involved. Organisers are anticipating many more to follow.\\nJeremy Payne, Principal of St. James’ Church of England Academy in Bournemouth, said:\\n“I’ve been thrilled by the huge response we’ve had to the Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge, with schools up and down the country asking to take part. Young people in school today will bear the brunt of the future environmental impact of waste plastic, so it’s essential that they learn to take responsibility for their own plastic use. We have seen first-hand how passionate the children become about this subject when they really see the consequences of our actions.”\\n“The Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge offers an exciting way to simultaneously unite schools in plastic education and also attempt to set a new Guinness World Record. We all have an important role to play in looking after the future of the planet, and the Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge teaches that every one of us must play our part in combatting this global issue.”\\nSpeaking about the challenge, Revered John Pares, Priest in Charge of St James and St Clements Churches in the Diocese of Winchester, and governor of St. James’ Church of England Academy, said:\\n“This project is a wonderful, inventive way of encouraging young people to take responsibility for their environment. I think we are all increasingly aware of the damage that plastic is doing to the oceans and our coastline, and it is vital that we take action now to preserve and defend all of God’s creation.\\n“Care for the environment is fundamental to Christian faith, as we seek to protect the gifts that God has given us and create more sustainable communities. The Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge, which began at St. James’ Church of England Academy, is now raising awareness and inspiring environmental responsibility in school children across the county.”\\nThe Guinness World Record Attempt is taking place on Wednesday 27th June, 2018 at 14:00 BST. Simultaneously, at multiple locations around the country, thousands of plastic bottle boats will be launched, retrieved and recycled.\\nThe idea for the challenge originated at Queen Mary Sailing Cub hoping to connect with local schools and has now been supported by the Heathrow Community Fund with an initial grant of £17,000 to enable the production of a website to scale the project nationally.\\nTony Bishop, Club Secretary at Queen Mary Sailing Club said:\\n“It’s overwhelming the amount of support we have received for the challenge, the response from schools and teachers has been fantastic. Sign up will remain open right up to the day of the attempt and there is a great team behind the challenge to support anyone wishing to get involved.”\\nSchools across the country are invited to visit the website at www.plasticbottleboatchallenge.com and sign some, or all, of their children up for the attempt on June 27th this year.',\n"," 'Forestry Commission Scotland’s (FCS) Forest Kindergarten training has received full SQA accreditation, meaning it could be rolled out to educational institutions across Scotland as early as August.\\nThe Forest Kindergarten programme was developed by FCS in 2009 and is designed to equip early years teachers with the knowledge, understanding and skills to support children in learning through play in local woodlands and green spaces.\\nThe course includes activities such as exploring for bugs, tracking animals, arts and crafts, den building, and learning about the dangers and risks to look out for in a woodland setting.\\nResearch has shown that play and learning in woodland and greenspaces leads to a range of benefits for children’s development, including better concentration, better communication skills, greater stamina, improved balance and coordination, increased confidence and appreciation of the outdoors.\\nSally York, education policy adviser at Forestry Commission Scotland, said: “FCS’s partnership with the SQA has been invaluable for accrediting the Forest Kindergarten course. With it becoming a nationally recognised qualification, this will add value to the course for early years practitioners. It will benefit them and the children they work with, in that the practitioner will have a more in depth understanding and appreciation of early years pedagogy and play outdoors.”\\nFCS is seeking colleges and educational institutions from around Scotland to deliver the newly accredited Forest Kindergarten course as part of their early years curriculum. The programme is currently being delivered by West College and has been completed by almost 200 students.\\nGeraldine Miller, curriculum quality leader childhood practice at West College, said: “We have been embedding the three-day Forest Kindergarten programme in our course delivery since 2014 and are very fortunate to have the support of FCS in its roll out for early years students. The Kindergarten programme thus far has engaged students and staff in practical hands-on learning, designed to equip them with the skills needed to make the most of the outdoor space available. This allows children the freedom to play, explore and learn without limits.\\n“With the Scottish Government 1140 hours expansion programme underway it is important for early years practitioners to embrace the possibilities within the boundaries of their settings. As a college we are delighted that SQA and FCS have this new National Work-based Award, which recognises the value of on and off site outdoor space as an integral part of the learning processes for pre-school children.”\\nColleges, educational institutions and early years practitioners interested in finding out more about the Forest Kindergarten programme, please contact Marian Cairns at marian.cairns@forestry.gsi.gov.uk',\n"," 'Children at a local primary academy have paid tribute to the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing by creating a memorial meadow garden and a mural depicting the history of Manchester.\\nLocated just a few miles from the site of the tragic attack, Old Trafford Community Academy’s 425 pupils were ‘deeply affected’ by the tragic attack which took place on 22nd May last year.\\nMarking the anniversary, the school also came together for a special assembly and to make bee friendship bracelets – the symbol for Manchester.\\nVice Principal, Andrew Marlow, said it was important for all of the pupils to mark the anniversary by remembering those who had lost their lives and to remind themselves of the importance of ‘standing together in solidarity’.\\nHe said: “We are situated very close to the arena, and the horrendous attack which took place last May affected us all very deeply. For a long time after, the community experienced a high police presence whilst investigations took place, which caused many children and parents to feel unsettled and on edge.\\n“We therefore felt it was important to mark the occasion and remember those who sadly lost their lives by doing something that brought us all together as one. Something that reminded us that we have each other and that we are stronger standing together in solidarity.\\n“The first anniversary of the attack will be an intensely emotional time for us all, but our memorial garden and our Manchester Wall, which will be created on the anniversary, will be a daily reminder to children and staff of those who died, those who lost loved ones, and those who were left physically or mentally injured.”\\nOld Trafford Community Academy is one of 15 primary academies that form Focus-Trust – a charitable multi-academy trust based in the North West of England.',\n"," 'Durham School pupils and children from Russia have been exploring each other’s cultures.\\nYoungsters from St Petersburg and Moscow spent a busy week in Durham with their counterparts from Bow School, which included a ‘Mini World Cup’ ahead of the real thing in Russia this summer.\\nDuring their stay the 25 Russian children (13 from Moscow and 12 from St Petersburg), aged between 8 and 11, took part in lessons and activities at Bow, Durham School.\\nThe visitors hosted assemblies with the help of pupils at the independent prep school and the cultural exchange finished with an outstanding performance of young Bow School dancers together with their new Russian friends.\\nMeanwhile the Russian teachers delivered a Russian Folk Workshop for the British pupils teaching Russian dance, songs and making ancient Russian children’s games.\\nSally Harrod, Headmistress of Bow, Durham School, explained: “The children had an amazing and enriching week.

The global challenge, which has been running since 2010, features teams from Universities, Engineering Institutions and the US and French Naval Academies, but Epsom College stands alone as the only school in the world to compete.\\nIn June, 10 sixth-form pupils will launch their carefully-crafted vessel ‘That’ll Do 2’ from the south coast of England, in the hope that it will complete the treacherous 4,000 mile transatlantic voyage to the east coast of Antigua.\\nLed by Jamie Styles, Epsom’s Head of Chemistry, and Chris Telfer, Head of Physics, The Microtransat Challenge has brought together students from the Mathematics, Geography, Science and Computing Departments, who have been working on the design of their boat since September 2016.\\nThe initiative is part of the school’s STEM offering, which allows students to explore aspects of science, technology, engineering and maths outside of the curriculum. The club’s aim is to allow students to gain teamwork and leadership skills while working collaboratively to solve problems big and small.\\nThe boat’s complex components include a USB datalogger which will be used by the team back in Epsom to track ‘That’ll Do 2’s’ voyage across the Atlantic. The device, which is self-designed and programmed, weighs just 100 grams and logs latitude, longitude, altitude and temperature data. The boat itself uses a GPS module to calculate its position and to determine a safe passage to the next waypoint. This information is stored in its memory, using software the students have written themselves.\\nThe boat also has the ability to transmit its location every hour, from anywhere in the world, directly to its own Twitter feed, via the Iridium satellite network.\\nTo date there have been 24 Microtransat attempts, but none has been successful. The best effort so far came from Offshore Sensing, whose 2m boat travelled 68 days before being picked up by a fishing boat. Epsom’s first attempt, in the summer of 2016, received support from the Royal Navy and reached a commendable 374 km in 4 days and 21 hours before being recovered ashore.\\nThis year’s team is well aware of the size of the task and their chances of success given that a number of better-funded and resourced universities have already tried and failed.\\nMr Styles said: “We have a monumental challenge ahead of us, but we are determined to produce a vessel that has the potential to reach the finish line. The biggest threats we face are from external factors which are largely out of our control; fishing nets, adverse weather and larger boats. \\xa0However, we aim to stay one step ahead with a carefully plotted route and a robust boat that is fit to face the elements.”\\nIf successful, ‘That’ll Do 2’ should arrive in Antigua approximately six months’ after launch.',\n"," 'We, at Adobe, are inspired by the educators we meet around the world who use technology to improve the way students learn and build creative problem-solving skills. Our\\xa0research\\xa0showed that this is important to nearly every educator and policymaker, because jobs which require creative problem-solving are less likely to be impacted by automation, and more likely to pay high salaries.\\nThe study also confirmed that many of the barriers to teaching these skills, seen in classrooms, are universal — some of the biggest of which are limited budgets, access to technology, and time to learn new apps. As teachers shift their classrooms to incorporate creative projects that build these skills, over at Adobe, we are also shifting our offerings to give them an affordable, easy, and quick way to succeed.\\nIn January, we announced we were providing access to\\xa0Spark for Education, a set of storytelling apps with premium features and additional capabilities for primary & secondary schools as well as higher education institutions,\\xa0free of charge.

But then a hush fell over the room, and one of them asked their teacher, “how will I finish my project if I can’t work on it during this class?”\\nTalking to the teacher more, Sharif learned that because access to Creative Cloud was limited to the computer lab, they had to dedicate most of their class time to students working on their project. They could not spend as much time as they wanted teaching students the principles of design and visual communication. With Creative Cloud for primary & secondary schools user licensing, students can continue working on projects at home, and on any device, simply by logging in and opening the apps they need.\\nThese licenses will be available to individual primary & secondary schools starting at £2,495 per year for 500 user licenses (£4.99 per license) to provide to students and teachers.

The news follows last year’s Trust expansion as Abbeyfields First School was welcomed as the first step in its aim to grow to around 15 schools in the next five years.\\nSimon Taylor, CEO of The Three Rivers Learning Trust, said: “We are delighted to welcome these three community schools to the Trust. All of them are important local institutions that strive to give every child the self-confidence to develop a lifelong love of learning they can use in whatever they choose to do in the future.\\n“Throughout the Trust, each individual is truly valued for their unique contributions, and as a larger Trust, we’ll have a greater expertise to share among each school, to help us deliver the inclusive and innovative educational services that parents and students alike seek out, together with a more effective transition between Key Stages that empowers all our children to thrive.”\\nThe move is already paying dividends as the Trust’s growth enables it to access capital funding of around £500K per annum that will help improve all of the school buildings it looks after. Liam Murtagh, Executive Head of Dr Thomlinson Middle School and Thropton First School, added: “We feel that this exciting development for both our schools will deliver significant benefits to the future learning and wellbeing of our children.”\\nThe Trust expansion has also led to a review and restructure of leadership roles, including the introduction of a CEO, and the appointments of new Headteachers at Chanty and Newminster Middle Schools, and at The King Edward VI School, all in Morpeth.\\nFollowing a robust recruitment process, Simon Taylor, who was previously Executive Headteacher across The King Edward VI School, and Chantry and Newminster Middle Schools, will now lead all seven establishments as CEO, while from September 2018, Clare Savage, previously Deputy Head at The King Edward VI School will take up the Headteacher position. Meanwhile, Liz Kinninment will become Headteacher at Newminster Middle School, having previously been Head of School, and Bryan Stewart will lead Chantry Middle School as Headteacher, moving from his previous position as Deputy Head of The King Edward VI School.\\nSimon Taylor said: “We are thrilled to confirm these appointments, which not only strengthen our leadership and governance, but also provide continuity across the Trust for the mutual benefit of staff, students and parents.”\\nAll seven of The Three Rivers Learning Trust’s schools are publicly funded, independent schools, working together as one cohesive unit in response to local educational needs. With greater autonomy and collaboration across an age range from three to 18, The Three Rivers, which was previously a Multi-Academy Trust made up of The King Edward VI School, along with Chantry and Newminster Middle Schools, is able to provide better links throughout the school experience to improve career opportunities for staff and students alike.\\nBut from September 2018, Chantry Middle School, which is popular and currently oversubscribed, is to take on an extra 30 pupils as part of an agreement with Northumberland County Council to ensure every pupil in Chantry’s catchment area is guaranteed a place at their local school. Simon continued:\\n“Morpeth is a growing community, with demand in particular on Chantry and Newminster Middle Schools growing alongside it. We’ve worked with the local authority to meet this growing demand, by expanding Year 5 at Chantry Middle School by 30 places from the beginning of the next academic year, and if demand remains high, Newminster will also take on an extra 30 pupils in Year 5 from September 2019.”\\nThis arrangement could continue year on year to support the increasing school age population as the Trust works to achieve greater efficiency and excellence across all its classrooms. Simon added:\\n“We are now working with Northumberland County Council to ensure The King Edward VI School has the necessary facilities to support the increased demand as these larger middle school year groups progress through their school careers.”\\nTo find out more about the Three Rivers Learning Trust and its schools, visit https://www.the3rivers.net/.',\n"," 'Ormiston Academies Trust, one of the leading education providers in the country, today announced that Amelia Walker will be its new National Director for Strategy and Quality Improvement.\\nAmelia joins the Trust from Ofsted, where she has been Deputy Director for Research and Evaluation since September 2016.

The eAssessment is a key stage in the IB journey to developing students who are independent and critical thinkers with the skills to create a better world”.\\nBeyond rote memorisation \\nThe MYP eAssessment, which is regulated by Ofqual in the UK, is for MYP Year 5 students and goes beyond rote memorisation—75% focuses on inquiry, communication and critical thinking skills.\\nWilkinson said: “Students are challenged to connect what they have learned with what they might learn next, collect data, analyse results and apply big ideas to solving real-world problems. As such, a single examination provides an effective assessment of the broad range of knowledge, skills and concepts needed to thrive and succeed in the 21st century”.\\nDifferent types of tasks are used within the on-screen examinations to test specific skills meaning that student’s achievement against all subject objectives is thoroughly tested. For example, a short essay assesses writing capabilities, creating an infographic to assess communication skills.\\nCommenting on the relevance of the eAssessment for MYP students, Angela Brassington, an MYP coordinator at Munich International School said: “Students prefer the on-screen examinations because this reflects how they learn on a daily basis. The on-screen examinations are media rich and dynamic, so questions can be designed that require much more creative responses or responses that require students to manipulate data and present new understandings, in a way that is not possible on paper”.',\n"," 'The UK’s brightest innovators from schools across the country competed in the final of PA Consulting Group’s sixth annual Raspberry Pi coding competition on Tuesday 17 April 2018.\\nPA’s annual competition aims to inspire the innovators of the future. This year, it challenges school children and college students to use the credit-card-sized, highly capable Raspberry Pi computer to produce innovations to help save the planet.\\nThe winners of the 2018 competition were as follows:\\nPrimary school: academic years 4 – 6\\xa0 Ysgol Deganwy, Conwy\\nThe winning entry in the primary school category was Ysgol Deganwy, who created ‘Recycle Michael’. This is an interactive rubbish bin that uses a barcode scanner to scan barcodes on waste packaging and then display useful information on a screen above the bin compartments. The bin is designed to enable users to identify which recycling compartment to put their waste into and also develop their understanding of the importance of recycling through interesting and educational facts displayed when a product is scanned.\\nWhy the team won: The clarity of the team’s idea impressed the judges. Recycling is a major issue and the team solved it in a really simple way. The judges can see the potential of the idea and could imagine Recycle Michael being scaled up to appear in offices and homes across the country.\\nFinalists: Croydon High School; St Mary’s Church of England Primary School\\nSecondary school: academic years 7 – 11\\xa0 Kenilworth School\\nThis team created a solution to energy waste; a system of infrared beams which work together to identify when no-one is nearby, and switch off the unnecessary streetlights in the area. Multiple infrared pointers and receivers can be controlled by a single Raspberry Pi, saving costs and energy consumption. An infrared mirror on the opposite side of the road to the transmitter is used to reflect the beam back to the receiver, and when the beam is broken, all the streetlights nearby are turned on.\\nWhy the team won: The team had a clear and inspirational goal and the judges loved the way they used different technology to solve their problem. The team also had an excellent mix of skills.\\nFinalists: Tanbridge House School, Usk Code Club\\nSecondary school/college: academic years 12 – 13\\xa0 The College of Richard Collyer \\nThe winning team created a simple, portable and lightweight charger that makes use of two renewable energies (wind and solar power) to charge four rechargeable AA batteries. It does this without harming the environment. The team created a small-scale model that has the potential to power much more than batteries if it was to be upscaled and produced industrially.\\nWhy the team won: The judges were impressed by the imagination of the team and how their innovation used mostly recycled materials. The team were also able to present the technical details of their idea to the judges with clarity.\\nFinalists: Felpham Community College, King Edward VI Grammar School\\nAnita Chandraker, who leads PA’s innovation services team, says: “The quality of ideas the teams have come up with for the 2018 Raspberry Pi challenge is astounding. The finalists have developed genuine innovations, some of which we think could be applied in the real world to help improve sustainability.\\n“As a firm, we are passionate about technology and our aim for the competition is to highlight the importance of technology and coding skills, and their role in supporting our future economy. It’s such an inspiring competition and we are delighted to see young children getting involved in coding with such passion and enthusiasm.”',\n"," 'The second of three purpose-built schools which will transform education for pupils with social, emotional and mental health needs opened this week in Leeds.\\nSpringwell Leeds South at Middleton will serve 100 youngsters aged 11-16.

Icebergs are produced in a natural process known as “calving”, and recently, some dramatic changes have been captured, which may suggest the environmental conditions within the region have changed. Collaborating with Dr Anna Hogg from the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) at the University of Leeds, students will be analysing satellite imaging and sharing findings with other scientists.\\nDr Hogg added: “There are really exciting opportunities for students to work with Earth Observation scientists on major changes at the poles. We used Sentinel-1 satellite data to watch a giant iceberg four times the size of London break free from Antarctica’s Larsen-C ice shelf in 2017, and now students can use the same data to measure if new icebergs calve off some of the fastest flowing glaciers in the world!”\\nMELT also challenges schools to calculate their carbon footprint by using the carbon calculator. As part of the project, students develop ideas for reducing their carbon output, which they will do by collaborating with other schools and groups across the UK and by sharing their data.\\nDarren Harman, STEM Learning Leader at Sir Robert Woodard Academy, commented: “MELT has presented a group of our Year 9 students at the Sir Robert Woodard Academy with an amazing opportunity to be part of novel science research, that will undoubtedly enrich their experience of learning science in a way that they wouldn’t otherwise have access to until university and beyond.\\n“Not only are they excited at what they might discover looking at data no other human has yet cast their eyes upon, but also the prospect of inspiring students at local primary schools to share in their experience of running live science research in schools.”\\nProfessor Becky Parker, director of IRIS said: ‘We’re really looking forward to seeing the results from the MELT project, it’s a great opportunity for schools to engage their students in work to impact the environment and use the latest satellite data.\\xa0 It’s fantastic to receive the backing from the UK Space Agency and our schools can’t wait to get started.’\\nFor more information on the Institute for Research in Schools (IRIS) and the MELT project, please visit the IRIS website, join in and get involved with MELT http://www.researchinschools.org/projects/melt.html',\n"," 'Adobe Spark empowers creativity and enhances digital literacy for teacher and students in classrooms and at home\\nAdobe announced today that Spark for Education with premium features and additional functionality is now available to primary, secondary, and higher education students free of charge. This follows an announcement during BETT 2018 and successful trials with primary and secondary institutes in various school districts across North America. Normally priced at £101.15 per year, Adobe Spark for Education is a fun and frictionless storytelling Creative Cloud application that runs in any web or mobile browser, enabling students to quickly and easily express themselves via graphics, web stories and video to complete their school assignments and showcase digital creativity.\\nAdobe’s research has shown that jobs of the future will demand both creativity and creative problem solving skills – two different capabilities that 97% of educators recognise as being essential for students to learn in school. However, the research also shows that the biggest barriers educators currently face to teach these skills are the lack of access to necessary tools and technologies and the time required to teach students how to use creative tools. Adobe Spark for Education was built to solve both of these issues. In addition to making the application free to schools, Adobe has also introduced named user licensing, enabling students to log into their account and work on creative projects from any location on any device, even from their homes. These licenses can be deployed by primary and secondary schools in a way that is consistent with data privacy laws including COPPA—the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.\\n“I have seen first-hand the importance of fun, easy-to-use creativity tools in the classroom, and believe that Adobe Spark will enhance how educators teach digital and creative-problem solving skills to open up a range of new possibilities for students who want to express themselves,” said Mala Sharma, VP and GM of Creative Cloud product marketing & engagement at Adobe. “Access to tools and resources is a key factor in education, and by providing Spark with premium features to K-12 (primary and secondary) schools and colleges for free and by offering single sign-on, Adobe is empowering educators to teach the critical skills their students need both in the classroom and when they enter the workforce.” \\nDetails on how educators can get Spark for Education with premium features for free for their school and universities, along with Spark training and professional development complete with a guide to using Spark in the classroom, can be found on the Spark for Education website. Additionally, Adobe offers a free platform, the Education Exchange, where educators can access free courses taught by their peers and share teaching materials and curriculum.\\nAbout Adobe\\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

Statistics released by UCAS, the admissions body, showed that there were 12,760 university applications from the UK’s richest postcode areas for the September 2018 intake, compared to a meagre 7,210 applications from students living in the poorest areas.\\nDespite this shocking disparity, one of London’s leading private tuition agencies (which can charge up to £200 per hour for tuition) has taken action to combat this imbalance in the education sector. Bright Young Things, whose clients include royalty, has partnered with The Access Project, a charity supporting bright young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to get to top universities. The aim of the partnership is to ‘provide quality education to all,’ said a spokesperson for the agency.\\nAccording to The Sutton Trust, 79% of privately educated children in London received private tuition in 2016. Despite the positives of children improving their confidence and attainment, this figure sadly demonstrates an increase in inequality: the 6.5% of children in the UK who are privately educated are also by far the most likely to be further supported by private education.\\nOnly 21% of the 93.5% of students in the UK not at private school receive tuition, and within these students are the staggeringly large 15% of secondary school pupils in the UK who are eligible for Free School Meals. Unfortunately, again according to The Sutton Trust’s research, these students only currently make up 2% of the intake at the UK’s most selective universities.\\nCharities such as The Access Project have been fighting to challenge these odds by working with motivated students from less privileged backgrounds over five years to offer them a stronger chance of meeting their potential. Bright Young Things has created a collaboration with them, in order to also reach out to these students: Booster Days. Booster Days are designed to bring Access Project students from around London together for a day’s close focus on one subject. The first session on April 6th focused on Chemistry, a subject that many students struggle with and for which there is a shortage of tutors. Led by Bright Young Things tutor James Weber and developed by Bright Young Things’ Carys Wright, the day focused on topics that were pre-selected by the students and approached in a range of ways.\\n‘The students were a joy to have in BYT headquarters, and the day was lots of fun,’ says Wright, before noting that 100% of students fed back that they’d like to attend another Booster Day. One student said, “My experience was great today. I learnt a lot and am more confident in Chemistry now!”\\n‘It is great that we have had such an overwhelmingly positive response to the Bright Young Things Booster Day,’ said Wright. ‘We see this a step in the right direction, towards providing quality education to all children, regardless of their socio-economic circumstances.’',\n"," 'Superheroes at Falcons Pre-Preparatory School for Boys have recently participated in a ‘funathalon’, raising over £3,000 for their charity of the year.\\nDetermined pupils at the Chiswick-based school dressed up as their favourite superhero and competed in an energetic assault course.

Most of the content is not work that is covered in the school curriculum, so students have to conduct extra reading and studying.\\nIona, who was one of three St Margaret’s pupils to take part in the Intermediate Olympiad last year – a precursor for younger students – has been invited to attend an awards ceremony at the Institution of Engineering and Technology in London in the summer.\\n“The questions were very challenging and so I was very surprised, and pleased, to do so well this year,” said Iona.\\n“It really helps to have a genuine interest in biology because you have to do quite a bit of additional studying for the test. All pupils who took part receive free membership to the Royal Society of Biology’s online student portal, which gives us access to current research and information, as well as the opportunity to get involved in other events.

And despite finding that teacher satisfaction levels are relatively high, it does acknowledge a retention crisis.\\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, commented:\\n“Anyone working in schools knows how rewarding it can be. Teachers are graduates, who have many career choices open to them – they go into teaching with passion, because they care and want to make a difference. But with teachers working the joint highest number of hours annually, with the joint lowest average hourly pay, there is a real danger of them burning out.\\n“This report shows that teachers are more likely to leave their profession than nurses or police officers – 12.3% per year, compared to 9.9% for nurses and 7.7% for police. While 78% of teachers say they are satisfied with their jobs, 47% said they were unhappy with their amount of leisure time.\\n“Workload is a huge issue for teachers. NFER state that teachers who leave appear to be motivated by reduced working hours and more opportunities for flexible working. And that, despite popular belief, the long hours that teachers work during term time substantially exceed the amount of extra holiday time they may receive. Unfortunately, many are finding the balance unworkable, and more and more great educators are simply tapping out.”\\nJames Bowen, director of NAHT Edge, said: “The DfE’s own data shows that almost 1 in 3 teachers leave within 5 years of qualifying, and EPI research shows that more than half (52%) of teachers have less than 10 years’ experience. These are people that the profession can ill-afford to lose. Not only is the profession becoming less experienced, we are losing excellent teachers who have the potential to become school leaders in the future.”\\nPaul Whiteman continued: “Teachers’ real average hourly pay has seen a substantial fall over the last decade – 15% compared to 4% and 11% for nurses and police officers. The case for more money for schools and a lift of the 1% pay cap is overwhelming – and urgent.\\n“Teachers, nurses and the police are all vitally important to this country, our children, and to the future.

Schools are absolutely pared back to the bone and now their only means to make savings is to cut back on staff costs. Pupils who require support will be hit hardest. To support these students, staff need regular updates to their training and we have evidence that this is also being cut.\\nMarijke Miles, acting head of Baycroft school, a special needs secondary in Hampshire, called the cuts “short-sighted”. She said: “All too often, the successes of my students happen despite the system, not because of it. And that can’t be right. The system is creaking because it is underfunded. This reduces students’ aspirations and it is very harmful for their wellbeing.”\\nPaul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said: “NAHT represents the vast majority of school leaders running special schools and alternative provision, and those settings are some of the best in the world. They deliver amazing results every day to enable children and young people to live up to their potential.

Spanning the entire period from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, the interactive timeline gives teachers a vivid visual representation of how Britain’s landscape and inhabitants changed in the 400,000 years from the Palaeolithic era to 43AD.\\nThe timeline features images of the kind of evidence that exists for Britain’s oldest inhabitants: footprints, bones and tools, as well as interactive maps showing important archaeological sites around the country. Through a series of visuals, the timeline illustrates the changing climate and geography of Britain – as it evolved from being a part of the same landmass as France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, to its eventual isolation as an island.\\nThe timeline works well alongside other Historic England online resources, for example the teaching notes, presentations and activities exploring life in  Bronze Age Britain through the exciting story of the recent excavation at Must Farm in Cambridgeshire; and a whole range of images for the period featuring archaeological sites around the country, tools and remains and modern reconstructions of homes and settlements.\\nCatherine McHarg, Archive Education Manager at Historic England said: “Our new interactive timeline is a really easy way into learning about prehistory – while still providing high quality, detailed and accurate information for teachers to work from. Teachers have told us that it can be a tricky topic, partly because many of them have not had the opportunity to learn much about the subject before they teach it. On top of that, they are sometimes battling preconceptions with children thinking that prehistory only means the dinosaurs! We hope by bringing all the information together into one place we can help put the period into context for teachers and their pupils – having a dynamic visual prompt of the chronology is a really effective way of doing that.”\\nThe tool is the latest addition to the popular library of free resources and teaching aids on HistoricEngland.org.uk/Education. The library includes  themed collections of images (including castles, cathedrals, children at work and crime and punishment), as well as  ready made presentations and worksheets linked to the curriculum.\\nAll Historic England’s education content has recently been updated and re-presented on its new website.\\nCatherine McHarg added: “We’re constantly updating what we offer to keep pace with changes in the curriculum and in response to what teachers tell us they need. We’re particularly focused on supporting teachers in working with local heritage, because apart from the difficulty some schools have in working out how to meet the curriculum requirements on this topic, we know that engaging children in the history they see around them every day is one of the best ways of exciting them about the subject. Local heritage projects are also a great way of galvanising children’s pride in their local area and helping them understand the broader span of history and where they fit.”\\nHistoric England has also curated around 10,000 archive and modern images specifically for teachers. The collection offers a comprehensive resource teachers can draw on to illustrate almost any topic or geographical region – the most popular images include a 1920s image of the Bryant and May match factory in London (birthplace of the first British trade union for women), a striking image of Victorian foundrymen in Maidenhead, and World War I Land Army girls at work in the fields of Devon.\\nSee the gallery of the most popular education images, and stills from the new prehistory timeline\\xa0here.',\n"," 'At Write Your Future we are developing academic research into the importance of handwriting, and creating resources to support teachers in the classroom.

Commissioned by BESA, the research was undertaken by the National Educational Research Panel (NERP) with 557 primary schools and 366 secondary schools.\\nPrimary schools are projected to expand spending on ICT during 2018/19. The increase is likely to equate to an average of £400 per primary school. The overall market impact is forecast to extend spending by around £7m.\\nFor secondary schools, the forecast for 2018/19 is also more positive, with spending expanding by £9m (+3.5%).\\nWhile this additional expenditure is welcome, it is much needed. BESA’s research found that only 33% of secondary schools and 60% of primary schools consider that they are sufficiently equipped with ICT infrastructure and devices. Primary schools are therefore planning to dedicate the additional spending to networking and peripherals items, in addition to allocating about a third of their budget to devices for pupils and teachers.\\nCaroline Wright, Director General of BESA, said: “Seeing schools ready to increase their spending on ICT in 2018/19 is an encouraging sign that schools are increasingly recognising the positive impact educational technology has, when applied well, on pupil performance.\\n“The Bett Show will likely reflect this change and I expect to see strong interest by teachers as they will witness the infinite potential of EdTech knowing that they now have some additional budget to bring this transformational technology into the classroom.”\\nOn the lack of ICT infrastructure in schools, Caroline Wright said: “Disappointingly two-thirds of secondary schools still say that they are not being sufficiently equipped with ICT infrastructure and devices. There is, therefore, more to do to provide pupils with access to the necessary resources, EdTech tools and skills to enable them to compete in a global skills market.\\n“These findings show that schools are making a step in the right direction, but it is the first step in the longer marathon of ensuring schools are well resourced in their curriculum and resources budget across the wider system.”\\nwww.besa.org.uk',\n"," 'Childline counselling sessions about mental health issues peaked at 101,454 last year, as stagnant funding from Government prompts call to action.\\nThe number of children seeking help from the NSPCC-run service specifically for mental and emotional health, self-harm or suicidal thoughts and feelings rose 12%.\\nThe NSPCC is calling on Government to increase the amount of funding it gives to Childline to help meet this rising demand, to support children 24 hours a day and to help them before they reach crisis point.\\nLast year Government proposed in its Green Paper the introduction of mental health support for children and young people in schools.\\nHowever, two thirds of Childline counselling sessions about mental health issues took place outside school hours (5pm-9am), demonstrating the additional need for out of hours support.\\nSome children told counsellors they are being directed to contact Childline after normal working hours by statutory services, such as child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) or local authority children’s services in England.\\nMore than 50,000 referrals to CAMHS were rejected last year with many cases not meeting the clinical threshold.\\nChildline plays an important role in helping children who are struggling with their mental health, but who do not meet the clinical threshold for access to CAMHS.\\nAt present Childline counsellors can only respond to 3 out of 4 children who need their help, as more and more children are using online counselling which requires more time and resources to answer.\\nThe charity is calling on Government to increase funding for the service so Childline can be there for every child who needs them whether that is during the day, night or at the weekend.\\nPeter Wanless, Chief Executive of the NSPCC said: “Increasing mental health support in schools will be an important step to ensure more children get the help they need.

The charity needs extra help from the Government to ensure the vital service is not vulnerable and can continue to be there for children whenever they need help and someone to talk to.\\nDame Esther Rantzen, Founder and President of Childline said: “More young people than ever before tell Childline they are overwhelmed by serious mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, and we are seeing this reflected in the amount of counselling sessions we are delivering. Our counsellors know we are literally saving lives, and it concerns us deeply that we cannot help every child who desperately needs to reach us.\\n“Childline is often the first place young people come to for help because they know they can talk to us in confidence when they have nowhere else to turn.

Active travel does not just begin and end at the school gates, it can be incorporated into lively classroom activities and assemblies. The theme of this year’s Big Pedal, ‘Around the world in 10 days’, links to key parts of the geography curriculum, such as being able to name the world’s continents and oceans. Endurance cyclist Mark Beaumont, who holds the Guinness World Record for cycling around the world in 78 days, is backing the Big Pedal 2018. After 18,000 miles on the road last summer, covering 240 miles a day and taking in 16 countries, Mark smashed the previous record by 44 days.\\nParticipating primary and secondary schools will receive a pack of teaching resources, including a map of the world for pupils to track their progress. Pupils will follow Mark’s route around the world, learning about the countries he passed through on his trip via a series of fact cards provided as part of the resources pack. Setting off from the UK, stops along the way include France, Germany, Latvia, China, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Canada and Spain.\\xa0 Each country’s card will include details such as the capital city and population size, as well as a piece of cycling or scooting related trivia.\\xa0 Children, parents and teachers will also be able to log, track and compare their journeys online using the Big Pedal website.\\nMark said: “I’m delighted to be supporting the Big Pedal 2018.\\xa0 It’s a great initiative for getting more young people on their bikes and scooters, building their confidence and independence in a fun and engaging way.\\n“Encouraging young people to cycle and scoot from an early age not only boosts physical and mental health, it also helps build good habits for independent and active travel into teenage and adult life.\\xa0I hope as many schools as possible will take part in this year’s ‘Around the World in 10 days’ Sustrans’ Big Pedal challenge.”\\nAccording to government guidelines, children and young people aged\\xa05 to 18 need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day. Walking, scooting or cycling to school is one way of boosting children’s activity levels and helping them maintain a healthy weight, while reducing congestion and air pollution around the school gates. Teachers find that pupils who walk and cycle arrive at school more relaxed, alert and ready to start the day than those who travel by car.\\nOrganised by walking and cycling charity Sustrans, and sponsored by Micro Scooters and Tonik, the Big Pedal is the largest competition of its kind in the UK. Last year nearly 1,700 schools registered to take part, with teachers, parents, siblings and pupils making more than a million journeys to school by bike or scooter. The Big Pedal 2018 is open to individual classes as well as whole schools, with hundreds of thousands of pupils expected to take part.\\nTo register visit www.bigpedal.org.uk',\n"," 'There is a wide range of evidence supporting the key benefits for young people of having an employer mentor, however, many industries and sectors remain heavily underrepresented in providing them.\\nLaunched on Monday 15th January, the next phase of The Careers & Enterprise Company’s #UnexpectedMentor campaign is targeting employees from these underrepresented industries. The campaign is calling on them to volunteer their time and share their experience and skills. The aim is to build a supportive and empathetic relationship to benefit a young person. Evidence shows that for mentoring to be most effective, role models need to be relatable to the young person they are supporting.\\nThe Careers & Enterprise Company initially launched its #UnexpectedMentor campaign in October 2017, to attract new mentors, representative of the whole population. The campaign sets out to change perceptions of who can be a mentor. But data from the first phase shows that many sectors and industries are still significantly underrepresented. Whilst there are exceptions, mentors currently come from relatively similar backgrounds and a limited variety of professions, such as the financial and service sectors.\\nIn contrast, very few mentors come from sectors such as manufacturing, retail and transportation – the three making up less than 10% of recent volunteers.\\nEmployer mentoring is increasingly seen as a valuable way of supporting young people, helping them stay engaged at school and making a successful transition into the world of work. The many positive outcomes associated with employer mentoring include improvements in behaviour, engagement and attainment.\\nClaudia Harris, Chief Executive of the Careers & Enterprise Company said:\\n“Many people assume that you need to work in an office and be in a senior role to become a mentor.\\xa0 But, in reality, people from all walks of life and with all types of experience have the potential to be a great mentor. The most effective mentors are relatable – people who may themselves have left education recently or have similar backgrounds or interests to the young person they’re mentoring.\\nBusinesses need to work with schools and colleges to genuinely achieve diversity in their workforces. There is a huge opportunity for a much more diverse set of mentors across England and we are calling on people to sign up now, to help our young people to prepare for brighter futures.”\\nTo become an Unexpected Mentor and share your skills and experience with a young person, visit careersandenterprise.co.uk/mentoring',\n"," 'The 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are fast approaching and will soon land in PyeongChang, South Korea, where a dynamic selection of British medal hopefuls will compete on the world stage.\\nGoverning body Snowsport England aims to capture the buzz created by the UK’s thrilling wintersports athlete performances and help introduce more teachers and pupils to skiing and snowboarding through the “PyeongChang to Piste’ campaign and National Schools Snowsports Week.\\nAs part of the campaign Snowsport England has released a dedicated school resources pack to boost engagement in snowsports.\\nThe cross-curricular resource pack is available for teachers keen to introduce young people to the exhilarating world of skiing and snowboarding, and engages those inspired by the approaching Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The initiative, which is linked to the computer science curriculum, uses computer games to increase interest and uptake of STEM subjects, build young people’s digital skills and provide an insight into what careers in the technology, creative digital and related industries might offer.\\nHosted annually by Cambridge Regional College, FXP Festival delivers an exciting hands-on game development experience, involving students with a wide range of abilities, from those experienced in coding, to individuals more interested in the creative concept and artistry of game design. By engaging local students with computer science, art and design, FXP Festival aims to both drive social mobility in the region and help close the technology skills gap.\\nOver the course of the Festival weekend (7 – 9 July 2018), teams of students, aged 13-19 (Year 8 – 13, and FE), are tasked with designing an original computer game concept, based on a surprise theme. FXP Festival is supported by major companies in the region’s technology and creative digital sectors, which provide expertise, mentoring and coaching to students and their teachers. 2017 supporters included: Amazon, Anglia Ruskin University, Jagex, Microsoft, ARM, Hacklab, Rizing Games, Cambridge Regional College. The Festival organisers have also created and sourced a range of teaching materials for schools to help them prepare for the weekend, available on the FXP website.\\nAlison Taylor, Co-founder of the Festival and Managing Director of Conscious Communications, comments: “FXP Festival aims to inspire young people to develop their digital and creative skills, and provides a fun, practical way for students to engage with STEM subjects. The tech industry is facing a huge skills crisis – recent research from CWjobs has revealed that 94% of tech employers believe there is an industry-wide skills shortage, with 60% of employers stating that coding will become a key requirement for entry-level tech positions. With the help of our supporters, FXP Festival is playing an important, grass-roots role in closing this gap.”\\nMark Ogilvie, Design Director at Jagex, has been fundamental to the Festival’s success since inception. He commented: “We love getting involved with FXP Festival, the event gives us a unique chance to interact, engage and inspire the next generation of digital talent, whilst teaching the students important skills. As a growing organisation, Jagex is always thinking about its recruitment pipeline, FXP is a fantastic opportunity to meet the young faces that will make up the future of our industry.”\\nAlison continued: “As well as improving their knowledge of the gaming industry and computer science, FXP Festival gives students and teachers the opportunity to develop valuable team-work, creative and communication skills. Our ambition to drive social mobility is a big factor in the organisation of FXP Festival – the government’s Social Mobility Index has identified Cambridge and East Cambridgeshire as social mobility ‘cold spots’, meaning we are within the worst performing 20% of authorities in the UK.

The question is how does this impact on their health, personal development and learning?\\nHealth is impacted negatively by not getting enough exercise, leading to increasing rates of obesity in children and adolescents. Children are not playing outside as much as they used to, limiting their exposure to sunlight and thus the generation of vitamin D which helps to fight infection and keeps skin healthy. Sunlight also helps to regulate the production of melatonin which regulates sleep. Electronic devices emit harmful blue light, which can cause headaches and eye strain. Blue light in the evenings can even limit the production of melatonin, which in turn can make going to sleep very difficult for some children.\\nSo what is the answer to this slippery slope that we find ourselves on… More time outside!\\nWith such a lot of time spent at school there is a real opportunity to take these important learnings and increase the options for children to learn and play in the outdoors. Ofsted are in agreement that more time outdoors is of benefit to pupils …\\n“When planned and implemented well, learning outside the classroom contributed significantly to raising standards and improving pupils’ personal, social and emotional development” \\nOfsted (2008) Learning outside the classroom. How far should you go?\\nDespite this, a survey has shown that although “97% of teachers believed that schools needed to use their outside spaces effectively to enhance their pupils’ development, 82% did not agree that their own school was making as much use as it can of this valuable resource”\\nLearning Through Landscapes (2010) Research showing the benefits of outdoor play\\nSo what can be done?\\nThere are a lot of organisations who promote outdoor activities, such as Learning Outside the Classroom, The Outward Bound Trust and The Woodland Trust. Many of these offer ideas for outdoor learning as well as courses for teachers and school resources to download.\\nIn the UK, the weather can often be a barrier to taking children outdoors for regular lessons and it may be that the addition of a school canopy or shade sail, may be just the thing to make sure that your school is not depending on the British weather to get the children in the fresh air.\\nImagine a school campus with a custom built outdoor sheltered learning space, which is ready to use every day of the year! What a fabulous way to make sure that your children make the most of the natural world and all the benefits this can bring.\\nThese can take the shape of Umbrella style shelters, Tepees, Shade Sails or steel and polycarbonate school canopies. For a larger sheltered area, a covered MUGA would provide space for all year-round sports and learning activities outdoors. Perhaps a bespoke school canopy would be something to consider, these can be designed specific to the school and made to measure. Whatever the requirement, there will be a school canopy solution to help bring the benefits of outdoor learning to as many children as possible.\\n“Outdoor learning can benefit pupils of all ages and be successful in a variety of settings… [it] enriches the curriculum and can improve educational attainment” \\nEducation and Skills Select Committee.\\nFor more information about A&S Landscape’s shade sails and other canopy solutions please click here.',\n"," 'Architecture Initiative’s new school in east London has opened its doors to over 700 primary school pupils.

The three-storey, glazed atrium creates a circulation core that separates the structure into two distinct volumes: one accommodates the teaching centre; the other contains the administrative and communal spaces, delivering the added benefit of opening the facility to the wider community outside of generic schooling hours.\\nIncreasing the capacity of the school three-fold creates extra places for pupils that are sorely needed in Tower Hamlets, where demand for places is expected to rise by as much as 38% by 2022. Replacing a single-storey 1982 structure, Architecture Initiative’s design safe-guards the quaint ‘village-feel’ by expanding vertically to avoid sprawling across the site plan and consequently affecting the landscape.\\nGreen space is incredibly important to Olga Primary School and the architect responds to this by incorporating a variety of terraced gardens and trees to create a rare ‘green oasis’ to inspire children within an exciting and unconventional environment. All year groups have immediate access to outside space – the ground floor to the gardens; the first floor to terraces; and the second floor to the roof – linking the pupils with the ecology of the surrounding area. The interior fit-out optimises a small palette of bright aquas and limes to complement the raw materiality of the pale concrete finishes and birch ply interior cladding – expressed in a contemporary, Scandinavian style. Large graphics ensure that the teals and greens of the site’s gardens are brought into the interior.\\nLee Mainwaring, Design Director at Architecture Initiative, said: ‘Our aim is to ensure that a new generation of schools inspires and nurtures learning.

Although many areas of schools, colleges and universities are investing in digital processes to help increase efficiencies, many finance teams are still relying on traditional paper methods. This approach is no longer time or cost effective and can lead to errors, slow processing times and the need for space to store documents.\\nWith the Government’s pledge to go paperless by 2020 there is still a lot of work to do. Recent research from AIIM shows that 42% of organisations still rely on paper for business functions and within that 34% report that their most important business content is referenced and filed as paper.\\nAs 2020 approaches, education managers will face pressure to focus on eliminating paper processes across all areas where it’s no longer required and to invest in automated and digital services. Kefron, the information and document management specialist, can bring multiple benefits to finance teams with its Automated Accounts Payable (AP) service.\\nKefron’s Automated AP solution is a cloud-based platform for the management of data and document processing and automated workflow that works alongside existing accounting software. With G-Cloud 9 status and ISO 27001 Information Security accreditation, Kefron’s cloud platform offers secure 24/7 processing and complete scalability.\\nThe service works through data capture and scanning, allowing the information to be uploaded automatically and eliminating the need for manual input, saving staff time which can be used on other tasks. As a result, the invoice processing times, paper or digital, are decreased leading to cost savings. The AIIM research found that almost a third of those using automated solutions cited increased productivity as the biggest benefit it brought to them.\\nThe automation process also improves accuracy as it decreases errors associated with human touch points. This streamlines the process and gives customer satisfaction and confidence that invoices are accurate.\\nThe application provides complete and instant visibility to anyone authorised to view the documents. Anyone with access can immediately view the invoices and approve payments, increasing visibility, accountability and providing greater control of the AP process. The cloud based service also allows users to access documents remotely across devices including smartphones, laptops or tablets, allowing invoices to be approved or processed even when team members aren’t in the office.\\nThe paperless system also saves on physical office space as there is no longer a need for paper invoices to be stored. The data capture and scanning system means that there are fewer duplicate invoices and fewer that are lost or misfiled.\\nKristina Russell, UK Sales Manager, Kefron said: “Many areas of businesses are starting to go digital, however some functions, such as accounts payable, have fallen behind and continue to use more traditional methods such as manual input and processing. As a result, invoices can have errors, get lost or misfiled. Kefron’s service eliminates all of this whilst saving the team’s time and costs.\\n“Busy finance teams can’t afford to ignore how automation can bring multiple benefits to their day to day working, especially as Government pressure will increase over the next two years. Whilst initially some team members may be apprehensive to go digital once they see how much easier it makes their tasks and wish they had used the service earlier!”.\\nTo find out more about how Kefron call help visit www.kefron.com',\n"," 'Delta Security helps Woodbridge High School achieve ‘lockdown’\\nDelta Security, the CCTV and access control specialist, has helped Essex-based Woodbridge High School to further enhance the safety of its pupils and staff, with the installation of new swing gates that automatically close and restrict access in the event of a lockdown situation.\\nLockdown, according to the National Counter Terror Security Office (NaCTSO), is a procedure designed to quickly restrict access and egress to a site or building (or part of) through physical measures in response to threat, either external or internal.\\nThe lockdown system is designed so that the gates, situated at the school’s entrance, integrate with the existing access control and fob system. This enables school staff and visitors to access the site, but can be overridden and shutdown by authorised school personnel if site lockdown is required. Lockdown is activated through a button situated in the school’s reception, at which point an alarm is also raised.\\nRedbridge council has asked that all schools in the area put lockdown systems in place, and Woodbridge High School is one of the first in the area to have mobilised its system.\\nThe gates are fitted with a CAME Stylo automation, which is ideal for pedestrian gates. It features a highly-robust 24V self-locking motor, that will stand up against intensive use.\\nFrank Gordon, School Business Manager At Woodbridge High School, says in today’s climate security in schools in paramount:\\n“No one enters the school without authorisation at the perimeter, and registration at reception. Each year we build further layers of security, and in today’s climate it is especially important to ensure our perimeter is as secure as possible,” he explains.\\nDelta Security has been working with Woodbridge High School for approximately ten years and so Frank approached the company to help mobilise a lockdown procedure:\\n“Delta Security is a supplier we know and trust to provide a first-class service,” he says. “Dave Mundy has extensive security knowledge and listens to our needs. He was therefore able to advise the best solution for us, and install within the school-holiday period to ensure minimal disruption. I would always recommend Delta Security to other schools.”\\nDave Mundy, Operations Director at Delta Security, says lockdown procedures are becoming increasingly prevalent in schools: “We have seen increased interest from central London schools, especially around transport hubs such as St Pancras and Liverpool Street for a while now, and more recently in schools further out from the City centre. It is an area that I am particularly interested in, and give talks to schools on options and best practice.”\\nWoodbridge High School is a co-educational 11-18 comprehensive school, with c.1,650 pupils and 170 staff. Its large site accommodates a total of seven buildings.',\n"," 'Learners studying in a real or virtual class are three-times more likely to gain CICM professional qualification than distance learners\\nShort-cuts in learning and development ultimately hold employees back, and there is no substitute for hard work and classroom interaction, according to the world’s largest professional body for the credit community.\\nNew research from the Chartered Institute of Credit Management (CICM) suggest that while distance learning has its place, face-to-face education, in a real or virtual classroom, delivers three-times better results.\\nDebbie Tuckwood, CICM Head of Education and Professional Development, is concerned that while some learners may be happy with distance learning, they miss out on the interaction with their peers and teacher: “People generally learn better from each other,” she explains.\\n“Discussion between learners contextualises concepts and deepens knowledge and understanding. Learners are more likely to become emotionally invested in their learning and the level and intensity of their learning soars.’\\nDebbie points to recent CICM examination results in support of her view: “Learners studying for example at college or through a virtual class are three times more likely to pass CICM qualifications than learners who have studied by distance learning. Also, they are more likely to gain a good pass and progress their studies to the stage where they enter an exam or assignment for assessment.”\\nDebbie is not surprised by the results: “CICM qualification programmes are demanding and so investment in high quality tuition delivers a large return in terms of skills growth, confidence and progression. This is very different to a quick e-learning module or recorded webinar which you might access to improve a particular skill or keep up-to-date with a new regulation.”\\nShe says that only a few, highly-motivated and self-sufficient learners seem to cope with long programmes of study by unsupported distance learning: “Companies persuaded to economise on qualification course fees should think about the return on investment,” she concludes.\\nNew CICM Level 3 and Level 5 Diploma programmes start in January.

Genesys is fully scalable to manage and control multiple sites from a single control room (or even a single workstation) across a country, or even across continents. It features the most advanced levels of encryption to ensure network security, and is accredited to the highest standards of government national infrastructure security.\\nSteve Smith, Managing Director of ISM, says that the extension of the Genesys range gives customers greater choice: “There have been a number of articles in the security press talking about PSIM companies starting to develop systems that go beyond the current solutions and moving to a federated architecture.\\n“With Genesys, however, we are already there. Genesys Enterprise resolves issues associated with the increasing geographical scope of clients, corporations, governments and institutions, while adhering to a multi-tiered hierarchy (or ‘federated’ system), where total control is centralised but allows individual sites to maintain local control.\\n“The new addition is ideally suited to those large organisations with multiple sites across multiple regions, who might also want to ‘flex’ to accommodate further sites and geographies as their needs evolve. As this comes from the Genesys stable, existing users only have to upgrade from their existing version to Enterprise without the expense of a complete technology refresh.”\\nCrucially, the new development allows the integration of multiple systems from multiple manufacturers – all from one holistic integrated security system. Every electronic security or fire safety device from CCTV and Intruder Alarms, to Electronic Locking and Public Address can be monitored and controlled from a single platform, regardless of who made them.\\nMost importantly, it includes the existing Migrating 3+ technology, a patented automatic failover technology that adds higher levels of automatic configurable redundancy and power. Control is effectively distributed across multiple workstations: “We take power to your PC and multiple it by the number of PCs on your network,” Steve continues.\\n“What this means is that if one PC fails, control is migrated to another PC seamlessly, with no interruption or downtime. Our system is therefore not restricted in its performance by the size or capability of a server, nor does it require the expense of moving to server farms or utilising clustering software.\\n“It means we deliver the most extreme redundancy characteristics for the threats you have thought of, and those that you haven’t!”\\n“The Enterprise development within the Existing Genesys is not a development waiting for a trial site, but rather has already been installed within a high-security Critical National Infrastructure project. It is tested and proven at the highest level under the most demanding conditions – and has been very successful.”\\nGenesys is a ‘true’ ISMS system built around intuitive software that combines a range of industry leading features and benefits including an enhanced graphical user experience, 3-D modeling and a comprehensive event management database. Events and alarms are presented to the operator clearly as and when they happen.\\n“Operators can be quickly trained to gain maximum advantage,” Steve continues. “The system also enables users to make better use of their staff and resources, since you don’t have to have all of your control rooms working 24-hours.”\\n“Genesys is a truly unique solution offering advanced system architecture, unparalleled ease of use for the operators and very low lifecycle costs.”\\nThe ISMS software operates as a standalone platform over LAN or WAN networks for remote and local sites with workstations that can be transferred to any operating security control room on the network. This offers the end user flexibility when closing down sites or buildings for off-peak or out of normal working hours, or in the unlikely event of any system failures.\\nhttp://www.ism-uk.com',\n"," 'The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) is calling on teachers and careers advisers to sign up for its first ever careers event for educators, being held at its HQ at 195 Piccadilly, London, on Thursday 9th November.\\nWith the creative industries worth over £84bn to the UK and growing at twice the rate of the rest of the economy (Dept for Digital, Culture, Media & Sports, gov.uk 201&), the event is designed to showcase the wide variety of opportunities available to young people in this thriving sector.\\nAt the free event teachers will be invited to join panel discussions, workshops and breakout sessions covering subjects as diverse as talent spotting, career pathways, skills shortages, regional employment hubs and the realities of self-employment.\\nBAFTA award winning industry professionals will give first hand insights into how young people can get their talent noticed, the skills required to forge a successful career and training opportunities.\\nTeachers will also have the chance to try out BATA’s new online Careers Quiz, http://guru.bafta.org/careers-quiz, at the event.\\n\\nThe personality-based quiz takes young people through real life scenarios and based on their responses, suggests careers within the creative industries that fit with their natural aptitudes.\\n\\xa0\\nEach role is supported with a wealth of information on skills needed, routes into the career, as well as films from individuals already working in those roles, making the film an ideal classroom resource or content for careers and options evenings.\\nTim Hunter, BAFTA’s Director of Learning and New Talent commented:\\xa0 “We know that it can be challenging for teachers and careers advisers to give sound, up-to-date advice on getting into these industries as they’re evolving so fast.\\xa0 New roles are emerging all the time and the routes into film, games and television can be less formal and structured than in other sectors.\\n“Through our new BAFTA Creative Careers Showcase and Careers Quiz we want to show educators and young people that if you find the right career fit, have the benefit of quality information and mentors, and know how to access training and networking opportunities, there’s a good chance of securing a job doing something you really love.”\\n\\xa0\\nBooking a ticket\\nTo register for a free ticket for BAFTA’s first Creative Careers Showcase Event on Thursday 9th November from 1pm – 5pm, teachers should send an email to events@bafta.org by Thursday 2nd November.',\n"," 'Delta Security, the CCTV and access control specialist, is helping to ensure the safety of pupils and employees at the recently opened Gesher School with the installation of a sophisticated Salto access control and ID pass system.\\nBased in North London, Gesher School is an independent primary school that caters for Jewish children with special educational needs. It is entirely charitably funded, and currently has ten children who receive specialist care from two teachers, five teaching assistants and four therapists.\\nThe Salto access control solution provides secure and convenient day-to-day access for authorised users, and enables school staff to print temporary ID passes for additional staff and visitors as required. The system’s easy-to-use software is capable of granting and restricting access to personnel according to their authorised area and duration of visit.\\nThe school shares its site with another local authority children’s programme so it is especially important that it is able to restrict access and have a reliable system to ensure it knows who is on site at any time. Reports detailing who has visited the school, and for how long, are available at the touch of a button.\\nGianna Colizza, Head Teacher of Gesher Primary School, says the installation went smoothly: “It was critical that the new system was in place in time for the school’s opening,” she says. “Delta Security was able to work around networking issues that arose from it being a new site, to ensure timely completion.\\n“The most important thing for us is to ensure we are doing everything we can to safeguard our children.

Of these, 86 per cent were concerned that children’s school readiness is worse than five years ago. The findings come from a new survey of school leaders published today by NAHT and the Family and Childcare Trust.\\nThe most common reasons highlighted by school leaders for children not being school ready were:\\n\\nFailure to identify and support additional needs early enough (67 per cent)\\nParents having less available resources / pressure on parents and family life (66 per cent)\\nReduction in local services to support families (63 per cent)\\nReduction in local health services to support families (57 per cent)\\n\\nAlmost a quarter said that more than half their intake was not ready for school.\\nAlmost 9 in 10 (88 per cent) said inadequate school funding was a barrier to improving school readiness.\\nSchool leaders highlighted particular concerns about communication skills and physical development. Speech, language and communication problems were the biggest issues with 97 per cent of respondents identifying these problems as a concern.\\nAs the Chancellor and his team at the Treasury are making decisions about this autumn’s budget, NAHT and the Family and Childcare Trust are calling on the Government to prioritise funding for support for families in the early years to help set children up to learn at school and beyond.\\nPaul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary said: “We want to see extra money for education, including early education before children start school, and renewed investment in critical services for families. Without proper investment, the youngest and most vulnerable in our society will be starting off behind, with uncertain chances of catching up.”\\nEllen Broomé, Chief Executive of the Family and Childcare Trust, said: “Four fifths of school leaders said that children who had no previous early education demonstrated the most challenging issues.\\xa0There is strong evidence that early education can help to boost children’s outcomes and narrows the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers – but only if it is high quality. The Government must make sure that every child can access high quality early education and that parents can get the right support to help them to give their children the best start in life.”\\nAnne Lyons, NAHT President, and head teacher at St. John Fisher Catholic Primary School said: “With this report we are hoping to highlight the impact that cuts to public services are having on families and children. The support that families of all kinds regard as essential are being cut back or have already disappeared. Cuts to school budgets mean that it’s also getting harder to address these issues once the children are in school.”\\nThe full report is available here.',\n"," 'Flashing, festive knits will be sweeping the nation once again this year as Save the Children’s annual fundraiser Christmas Jumper Day is taking place on Friday 15th December.

Only about 2-3% of UK children cycle to school compared to 49% of all Dutch primary school children.\\nPowered by national walking and cycling charity Sustrans and funded by the Bicycle Association on behalf of the cycle industry through its Bike Hub scheme, The Big Pedal has become the UK’s largest competition of its kind.\\nLast year more than 1,500 schools signed up to take part and teachers, parents, siblings and pupils made more than a million journeys (1,179,900) to school on their bikes and scooters.\\nIn total, participants travelled more than three million miles – the equivalent to more than 123 trips around the world – as well as saving two million car journeys and more than 847 tonnes of C02.\\nThe Big Pedal 2016 saved more than 2,500 gallons of fuel worth more than £12,000 and saw pupils, teachers and parents burn nearly 1.8million calories or a massive 7,000 donuts.\\nJoanna Rowsell Shand is supporting The Big Pedal for the second year running.\\nOne of the best British cyclists of her generation, Joanna has won five world titles across individual and team events and gold medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.\\nShe said: “Cycling is great for young people’s health, confidence and independence. The safer and more comfortable they feel on their bikes, the more they will enjoy cycling.\\n“The Big Pedal campaign is a fantastic way for kids to cycle together whilst learning about the rules of the road in a fun, engaging way. I hope this year as many schools as possible will take part in the UK’s largest school cycling and scooting event.”\\nBen Merry, Behaviour Change Coordinator for Education at Sustrans, said: “The average primary school journey is\\xa0just 1.6 miles – the perfect distance to walk or cycle.\\n“The Big Pedal is fun, inclusive and it helps schools to encourage whole families to lead more active lives, as well as reducing car traffic and pollution around the school gates.\\n“Although the competition runs for two weeks, it has a lasting effect on the way that the school community travel to school – last year 75% of schools that took part in the Big Pedal said pupils continued to cycle and scoot to school following the event.”\\nThe Big Pedal 2017 is open to individual classes as well as whole schools, with hundreds of thousands of pupils expected to take part.\\nAll schools will be entered into daily prize draws for rewards, including bike and BMX stunt shows and equipment if more than 15% of a school cycle or scoot on each day of the challenge.\\nFor schools unable to take part in the main challenge there is also a one-day version, which can include cycling and scooting activities in the school day as well as on the journey to school.\\nTo celebrate the finale of the challenge there is also the option to join Sustrans superhero fundraising day.\\nTo register for The Big Pedal 2017 visit www.bigpedal.org.uk',\n"," 'Oxford-based day and boarding school Rye St Antony is preparing for a creative start to the new year with a huge art project in collaboration with Christ Church Cathedral. Work is already well under way for the Year 5 pupils under the direction of the school’s Head of Art and Design, Jenny White.\\nFor the Week of Prayer for Unity (Wednesday 18 to Wednesday 25 January) and with the help and inspiration of the Oxford-based celebrated artist Nicholas Mynheer, young people from across the city have been invited to participate in an art project which depicts the need to care for creation. It is a way of acknowledging that much division and disunity in our world arises from consumption, greed and wastefulness in contemporary society.\\nA six-panel art installation (each panel measuring 2.2m x 1.2m) will explore the most basic of the earth’s resources featured in the creation story (light, water, land, air, shelter and sustainability) highlighting how human suffering can be alleviated and disunity between people and nations reconciled by addressing these most basic threats to our planet.\\nRye St Antony’s contribution to the installation will follow the theme of “shelter”. The creation will sit within the six-panel installation and will be displayed at Christ Church Cathedral from 18 to 25 January. The panels will provide a focal point for the Service of Unity on the evening of Sunday 22 January. Children from the groups who have shared in the creation of the panels will also share in the leadership of the service by taking readings and prayers.\\nCommenting on the school’s contribution to the project, Rye St Antony’s Head of Art and Design Jenny White said, \\u200e”Each of these panels will seek to draw connections between the story of creation in Genesis and the contemporary challenge to overcome hostility and division by caring for the planet. Here at Rye, we are delighted to be taking on the theme of shelter. The children’s idea to develop a background of harmonious colours was an inspirational starting point, and they also discussed shelter in the form of trees. As the pupils’ ideas progressed, the tallest member of the class laid down on the canvas and her classmates drew around her and her outstretched arms which formed the foundation of our painting.\\nThe other members of the class added their own arching arms and curved hands until it gradually turned into a tree shape, which became shelter for a pair of doves. The doves are in silhouette and the tree is energetic and vibrant. Our Year 5 pupils have thrown themselves into this project and we are absolutely thrilled to be involved. Through their involvement, the children have been thinking about conserving the natural habitat and sheltering the vulnerable, and have enjoyed the opportunity to reflect on their own experiences.”\\nSt Andrew’s Primary School in Headington, St Margaret’s Church Art Group and St Barnabus Primary School are among the other groups taking on a panel each. Each group was free to choose whatever style they wished to create their panel, but the same white cloth background was provided to each to allow for consistency in the final production. The aim is to capture the beauty and interconnection of life on earth and to imagine, in the face of so many threats to life, how we can cooperate with each other to nurture, restore and reconcile the world.\\nJenny White concluded, “Being asked to submit a group painting by Christ Church Cathedral is a wonderful opportunity, and we are delighted be involved in the Service of Unity on the evening of Sunday 22 January. We are also looking forward to finding somewhere big enough to display the painting at school when we get it back in February! The completed panels will be a culmination of lots of hard work by the six participating groups. The artwork expresses the pupils’ reflections, feelings and insights through shape, form and colour and it is a wonderful celebration of the children’s creativity and spirituality through the arts. I am sure that the size, colour and quality of the panels will transform the Cathedral and the overall effect will be striking.”\\nwww.ryestantony.co.uk',\n"," 'The Prospect union has written to education secretary Justine Greening requesting a meeting with Department for Education officials to discuss the government’s funding plans and strategy for school improvement.\\nIn the letter, national secretary Philippa Childs welcomes the government’s announcement of £50m a year for local authorities to continue to monitor and commission school improvement for low-performing maintained schools, and the new £140m strategic school improvement fund for academies and maintained schools.\\nChilds said: “Prospect is the largest union for school improvement professionals, so our members are keen for us to meet the DfE to flesh out more detail on its strategic proposals and how the new funding will be allocated.\\n“Members also want us to highlight the crucial role they play and encourage a discussion of key principles around mentoring and advising schools to produce successful outcomes for pupils across the whole ability range.”\\nShe pointed out that while many of Prospect’s members in school improvement are still employed by local authorities, others operate as private consultants or work for private companies that sell their services to schools.\\n“However, in all cases, their independence from the schools they support is important to ensure objectivity.”\\nWith the letter, Childs has enclosed Prospect’s standards for educational development and improvement professionals.

The study explores all educational choices by all students who took GCSEs in the summer of 2010 by linking three national databases for the first time.\\nBy taking into account factors such as where a child lives and their attainment at school, the research provides a unique analysis of how educational choices made at the age of 16 can have a deep impact on a child’s future career and earnings.\\nThe report finds that GCSE attainment and geographical access to post 16 courses explains some of the gap in choices made by children from different backgrounds. But it also uncovers significant differences between poorer children and wealthier children living in the same neighbourhood with the same GCSEs results.\\nOverall, the research finds that around a quarter of the progression gap – the different choices made by children after leaving school – is purely down to social background.\\nPrevious research has suggested that children from poorer backgrounds are less likely to have access to the knowledge and networks to help them make optimal education and career choices after leaving school.\\nIn its recent State of the Nation report, the Social Mobility Commission called for more careers advice in schools, and better destinations data to hold schools to account for the guidance they give young people.\\nThe report concluded that Britain has a deep social mobility problem which is getting worse for an entire generation of young people. It found that for every young person who gets into university from a treadmill or just managing family background, seven do not.\\nThis new research also reveals stark geographical inequalities in the choices of institutions available to young people. It finds that there are 20 areas of the country with little, or no, school sixth form provision within a commutable distance. In these areas, there are significantly lower percentages of pupils studying academic qualifications at 16, attending a top university or studying for a science or maths degree compared to similar areas.\\nIt also identifies the North East and the South West as having the fewest institutions for young people to choose from, which may be a significant factor in why post-16 and destinations outcomes are so poor in these regions. Whilst young people growing up on London have, on average, 12 post-16 institutions to choose from, those in the North East and the South West only have an average of seven colleges or sixth forms they could commute to.\\nOther key findings are:\\n\\nWhite British students are far less likely to go to university than ethnic minority students: Indian (72 per cent), Pakistani/Bangladeshi (57 per cent), Black (72 per cent) and White British (36 per cent). Participation differences between White British and other ethnic groups who live in the same neighbourhood and with the same GCSE attainment are even more pronounced.\\nWhite British students are more likely to drop out of post 16 education than ethnic minority students: Indian (3 per cent), Pakistani/Bangladeshi (8 per cent), Black (7 per cent) and White British (10 per cent)\\nFemale pupils are 8 per cent more likely to attend university than males (44 per cent versus 36 per cent). However, although female participation rates at top selective universities are slightly higher (10 per cent versus 9 per cent for boys), they are less likely to attend these universities than a boy from the same neighbourhood with the same GCSEs.\\n\\nAlan Milburn, Chair of the Social Mobility Commission, said: “When low income youngsters from the same area with the same school results are progressing less than their better-off classmates, that is not about lack of ability. It is about lack of opportunity. The progression gap has many causes but it suggests something is going badly wrong in our education system.\\n“The lack of proper careers advice in schools and the sheer complexity of the post-16 education and training system make it particularly difficult for lower income youngsters to translate their attainment at school into qualifications that are well rewarded in the labour market.\\n“That has significant consequences for social mobility and leads to many young people becoming trapped in low skilled, low paid jobs. Government and schools should be working to create more of a level playing field of opportunity for youngsters to progress.”\\nDr Rebecca Allen, Director of Education Datalab, said: “The age of 16 marks the first point in most individual’s educational lives where opportunities and choice can become markedly diverse.\\n“Our research reminds policy makers that they should pay attention both to geographical disparities in access to high quality post-16 provision and to understanding the reasons why students with identical opportunities make very different choices.”',\n"," 'Commenting on the announcement that the National Teaching Service will be scrapped, Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) says: “NAHT welcomed the pilot scheme when it was created. The idea of helping to get the right people into schools that need them the most was promising. I think we have learned now that we cannot rely on schemes that only transfer people from one part of the country to another. We must help local areas develop, support and retain their own staff.\\n“One reason the scheme has not delivered is that there are simply not enough teachers in the system. We have to get the basics right – proper starting pay and good working conditions.\\n“Yesterday’s annual report from Ofsted made this clear, and our own recruitment  survey released in November confirms that schools are struggling to recruit. This is felt by all types of schools across all regions.”\\nJames Bowen, director of middle leaders’ union NAHT Edge, says: “Whilst we are pleased that the government are finally taking steps to address the obvious problems with recruitment and retention, we need them to move beyond just tinkering at the edges with such schemes. Until they are prepared to address the real fundamental issues including teacher pay and workload these schemes are unlikely to have the desired impact.”',\n"," 'A major international survey of pupil achievement in mathematics and science shows that pupils aged 9 -10 in Northern Ireland continue to perform very well in maths.\\nThe National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) carried out the research for the Department of Education. Achievement in science was found to be not as high, but is still above the international average.\\nData from the 2015 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) reveal that only five of the 50 countries taking part in the mathematics assessments outperformed Northern Ireland.\\nEducation Minister Peter Weir said: “The report shows that primary schools here have maintained a strong performance in the subject as demonstrated in the previous TIMSS study in 2011.\\n“It also highlights that primary schools in Northern Ireland have highly qualified principals and teachers who are committed to continued professional development. The level of participation in professional development activities for mathematics was higher in Northern Ireland than that seen internationally.”\\nContinuing, the Minister said the findings reflect those of the Chief Inspector’s report (2014 -16) published on 16 November 2016 which found that in 89% of primary schools inspected, achievements and standards in mathematics and numeracy were good or better.\\nThe Minister said he was very encouraged by the findings of this study which show local children have a positive attitude towards educational achievement both at home and school.\\nHe said: “The vast majority of children have parents with a positive attitude towards mathematics and science.\\n“In addition, our principals and teachers were reported to have some of the highest levels of emphasis on academic success. A positive attitude towards learning is also fostered by our pupils with the majority reporting that they enjoy learning maths and science.”\\nMost children in Northern Ireland attend schools with an environment that is conducive to learning, according to the study. Schools which have few disciplinary problems are safe and orderly places of learning where pupils report relatively low levels of bullying. These positive aspects of the school learning environment have remained unchanged since the 2011 TIMSS study.\\nCarole Willis, Chief Executive of NFER, commented: “TIMSS provides a valuable way for nations to benchmark the performance of their education systems, and Northern Ireland has continued to perform well in this latest round.\\xa0 NFER has been involved in running TIMSS since it first began in 1995, and brings a unique combination of expertise in education systems and robust research.\\xa0 The insights we provide through TIMSS on students, their teachers and schools will help policymakers and schools in Northern Ireland to build on their strengths and address areas where its performance could be improved further.”\\nThe full national reports for TIMSS can be found at http://www.nfer.ac.uk/publications/TMSS01',\n"," 'The Into Film Awards are back for 2017 as Into Film sets out to find the best young filmmakers, reviewers, film clubs and teachers of the past twelve months – this year with the support of education partner NATE.\\nThis year’s Into Film Awards ceremony will once again take place at London’s ODEON Leicester Square on 14 March 2017.\\xa0 Designed to recognise, showcase and celebrate young people’s involvement in film and education, the star-studded, red-carpet event will bring together film industry professionals and young people to shine a spotlight on the filmmaking achievements of 5-19 year olds from across the UK, as well as recognising teachers’ use of film in the classroom, young film reviewers, and exceptional film clubs in primary and secondary schools.\\nThere are 16 awards to be won in 13 categories, including eight filmmaking sub-categories in live action, documentary and animation, alongside Reviews of the Year, Teacher of the Year and Film Clubs of the Year.\\xa0 A new guest category for 2017 in association with the UK Space Agency –  Into Film: Into Space & Home, invites young people to make short films inspired by Tim Peake’s space adventures and return to Earth.\\nSchools, organisations and individuals can enter and the deadline for applications is 31 January 2017.\\xa0 For information on how to enter, and to access filmmaking tips and resources, visit: http://www.intofilm.org/awards\\nSimon Pile, Into Film Teacher of the Year 2016 said:\\n“I’m thrilled to have won this award.

I remember my mum saying to me, when I’d been the victim of some bullying, ‘come home because you are always safe here’. Sadly that is no longer true.\\n“Kids spend less than twenty per cent of their childhood in school, so home is where they need most protection. We run evenings where we give advice to parents about how to do this, but often they’re not very well attended.\\n“So it’s frustrating when a parent of an eleven-year-old tells us they have no idea what social media their child is using, or who they’re interacting with in their bedroom on their smartphone. Schools and parents must work together. “\\nCarolyn Bunting, General Manager of Internet Matters, said: “Child safety online is one of the top concerns for parents, yet our research shows a third of parents admit they’ve never had a family discussion about cyberbullying.\\n“This is understandable.

The technology is often hidden, tucked away behind the scenes or on roof-tops. In fact, it is often at its best when it is invisible, just getting on with the job. But it is nonetheless essential.\\nMany of the manufacturing processes today require a refrigeration or cooling process; air conditioning and refrigeration systems also provide comfortable living and working environments. How would we cope without the domestic refrigerator; or air conditioning at work on a sweltering summer’s day?\\nDespite it being a huge and growing industry, we are currently facing a real skills shortage in refrigeration and air conditioning, which insiders predict will only get worse unless schools, government and businesses work harder to combat the issue with information, support and investment.

This can be quite challenging, but also very interesting and motivating for those people with the right mind and skill-set.”\\nIt’s a huge industry, the potential for which is simply not understood says project manager Mark Forsyth: “Students are not aware of the RAC career path opportunities at an early stage and many employers are reluctant to invest the time and effort in training. Apprenticeships should be part of a business growth strategy. We need more female RAC engineers too. “\\nDavid continues: “The area of connectivity and intelligent control is transforming the acr industry, and opening up a new chapter that has much more appeal to tech-savvy young people.

Providing support, training and foundational knowledge for young people in schools, colleges and universities is a key piece of the puzzle,” said Geoffrey Taylor, Head of Academic Programmes at SAS UK & Ireland.\\n“With the SAS Curriculum Pathways programme having achieved great success across the US, we are delighted to provide UK schools with the platform mapped to the English, Scottish and Welsh curriculums for all age groups. With official endorsement from educational bodies, English schools have the reassurance that SAS Curriculum Pathways is an excellent tool for its teachers and students alike.

Today’s announcement is the right decision and shows the Government has been listening to our concerns, which have been echoed by MPs, teachers and parents.\\n“Councils have been clear from the outset that the proposals within the Bill focussed too heavily on structures, when our shared ambition is on improving education for all children. In particular, both the forced academisation of schools in areas considered to be ‘unviable’, and the removal of the council role in school improvement, went against evidence that council-maintained schools perform more highly than academies and free schools in Ofsted inspections, and that conversion to academies did not in itself lead to better results.\\n“In our submission to the Treasury ahead of the Autumn Statement, we have called on the Government to take advantage of councils’ unique position in the community and give them a clear and strategic role in overseeing local schools systems, accompanied by appropriate resources, powers and flexibilities, so that they can support local school improvement and hold schools to account for education standards.\\n“We also urge government to reverse plans to cut £600 million from the Education Services Grant awarded to councils and academies next year.\\n“This funding is vital to help ensure that children are getting the education they deserve, from helping to provide speech therapy and physiotherapy, to carrying out DBS checks on staff and providing music services in schools. It also helps to plan for the new school places that are urgently needed, ensuring that every child has a place at a good school near their home.\\n“The LGA remains keen to work with the Department for Education to ensure that all partners are working together to deliver the excellent education that ensure every child gets the very best from their years at school.”',\n"," 'Public authorities like schools, galleries and leisure centres have to display a DEC. Did you know you can also use it as a powerful tool for improving energy efficiency?\\nFailure to show a valid DEC could result in a £1,500 penalty. Enquire now for a free and receive a free no obligation DEC checking service.\\n\\xa0\\nGetting efficiency right and effective\\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\\nBusiness visionary Peter Drucker said: “Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things,” and you achieve both with a Display Energy Certificate (DEC).\\nUnder European Directives 2002/91/EC and 2010/31/EU, you must display a DEC at any public building or one that’s frequently visited by the public in England and Wales, when it has a total useful floor area of 250m2 or more. By law, you must also have an advisory report.\\nIt’s advantageous having both. First, your local authority can charge a penalty of £500 for not displaying the DEC and £1,000 for failing to have a valid report. Second, if you take on board the report’s recommendations you can improve your building’s energy performance.\\n\\xa0\\nIt’s a must to show your ratings \\n_______________________________________________________________________\\nDisplay Energy Certificate regulations apply wherever your building is located in England and the UK. It could be a museum in London, a library in Manchester, universities and colleges in Birmingham, or a sports and social centre in Leeds.\\nAny building that’s frequently visited by the public must, under Environmental Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) legislation, of which DEC is part, show its energy performance.\\nThe DEC will display your operational ratings for the building from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). This is based on actual energy consumption over the last 12 months\\nWhere the building has a total useful floor area of more than 1,000m2, the DEC is valid for 12 months. The accompanying advisory report is valid for seven years. For buildings with a total useful floor area of between 250m2 and 1,000m2, the DEC and advisory report are valid for 10 years.\\n\\xa0\\nMore to DEC than meets the eye\\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\\nAs well as displaying your energy usage, the DEC requirements also help you keep tabs on your energy without superhuman effort.\\nYour DEC, and the advisory report that goes with it, has to be produced by an accredited energy assessor. There’s a whole team at Utilitywise, the UK’s largest energy consultancy, who can help you supercharge your savings.\\nThe report will recommend improvements to your building that are designed to drive up its energy efficiency, reduce your fuel bills, cut carbon emissions and improve the public’s perception of it.\\nSince non-domestic buildings are responsible for about 20 per cent of total UK CO2 emissions, according to leading authority on the built environment BRE, it’s good PR to be seen to be doing something to improve that statistic.\\n\\xa0\\nAny other questions?\\n\\xa0\\nChris Toole from Utilitywise said: “People often ask our energy assessors whether a DEC is required if you are a public authority and rent the building you own to a private company that’s not a public service.\\n“Our answer is no. It’s up to the occupier to provide a DEC and if they’re a private firm they don’t have to display one anyway.”\\nYou may also be wondering if you need an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). They’re similar to a DEC and all domestic and commercial buildings in the UK, bought or rented, must have one as part of the EPBD.\\nAn EPC is required to inform potential buyers or tenants about the energy efficient nature of your building and is valid for 10 years from date of issue. An EPC states an energy rating from A to G and is based on the performance potential of the building and its services. Before a DEC assessment can be carried out on a new build property, an EPC must be available for it.\\n\\xa0\\nYou can read more about DECs and how Utilitywise’s energy assessors can help here.',\n"," 'Crowdfunded Classrooms: Online educational crowd-funding campaigns show an incredible increase of over 200 percent since last year\\n  GoFundMe, the world’s largest social fundraising platform, today announced the ‘Go Fund My Education’ contest, the first ever GoFundMe contest to run in the UK.\\xa0 The contest will launch on 4 October 2016 and run through to 18 October 2016, giving participants the chance to win thousands of pounds toward their education-related cause.\\xa0\\nAlong with the launch of the contest, GoFundMe recently released statistics showing that students, teachers, and parents in the UK are increasingly turning to the site to raise money for education expenses, making it one of the fastest growing categories on the platform in the past year.\\nNew GoFundMe campaigns created for education-related causes in the UK have increased by 223 percent between 2015 and 2016 (YTD).

Once again, Deb is heavily involved in this day of advocacy, which promotes handwashing with soap as an easy, effective, and affordable way to prevent diseases and save lives.\\nFirst held in 2008, Global Handwashing Day is designed to support a global and local handwashing culture, shine a spotlight on the state of handwashing around the world, and raise awareness about the benefits of the practice. The day is endorsed by a wide array of governments, international institutions, civil society organisations, NGOs, private companies, and individuals.\\nThis year’s theme – ‘Make Handwashing a Habit!’ – highlights the importance of handwashing as a ritual behaviour. To be effective, hand hygiene needs to occur regularly at key times, such as after using the toilet or before contact with food.\\nDeb is encouraging primary schools in the UK to inspire their students to become ‘Hand Washing Champions’, with activities and lessons aimed at making the hand washing procedure at school fun, engaging, and memorable.\\nThroughout September, Deb there will be running a national ‘Hand Puppet Competition’. Students will be encouraged to design their own ‘Hand Washing Champions’ and enter their creations into a competition. The winning student design will be announced on October 31st and will receive a £100 book voucher. Furthermore the winning hand puppet design will be reproduced on a bespoke dispenser, which Deb will supply to the school free of charge across all their washrooms.\\nDeb is also encouraging schools to run a hand washing community day. On October 13th, Deb is organising a ‘Community Day’ with a local school – St. John’s Primary School in Belper, Derbyshire – where children can learn first-hand about the importance of hand hygiene from a Deb representative.\\n“Global Handwashing Day is a fantastic opportunity for people around the world to come together in celebration and support of better hand hygiene,” said Paul Jakeway, Marketing Director at Deb.\\n“We are thrilled to be working with schools in the UK, and support their efforts to make handwashing a daily routine for their students. Encouraging children from an early age and getting them into the habit of washing their hands as part of their school day will help ensure that this practise becomes part of their lifelong routine.”\\nEffective hand hygiene is universally recognised as the smartest means of infection control in educational environments. Yet, a survey by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine unearthed that only 63.8% of primary school pupils regularly washed their hands with soap at school, a figure which dropped to 39% for secondary school pupils.\\nLack of education about handwashing with soap could be contributing to the spread of diseases in schools. Inadequate hand washing could also impact absenteeism, with illness constituting almost 60% of all absences across schools in England. Annually, nearly 22 million school days are lost each year due to the common cold.\\nDeb is working towards catalysing habit formation and behaviour change in schools with a range of brightly coloured and attractive soap dispensers, which are designed to help engage children in the hand washing process. Dispensing systems are more hygienic, economical and environmentally-friendly than bar soap or bulk fill systems, and easy to operate for children.\\nIn addition to dispensers and a comprehensive range of skin care products, Deb also provides schools with a range of training and educational materials to ensure hand hygiene compliance is adhered to in educational institutions around the country.\\nTel: +44 (0) 1773 855100\\nwww.debgroup.com',\n"," 'If you’re a startup or a relatively small business, then it’s understandable if you don’t yet place a high value on the importance of branding for your future. But branding isn’t just a huge buzzword reserved only for the like of giant corporations. It is just as essential for SMEs.\\nNo matter what stage of growth your business is at, it’s important to perfect your branding from top to bottom, but knowing where to start can be tricky.\\nTo help you out Phil Foster, Managing Director of Love Energy Savings has shared his thoughts on why branding is important and some things to consider as you move forward.\\nWhat is branding?\\nIn a nutshell, branding is a business’ way of identifying who they are and what they do. It represents your values and the true core of who your business is.\\nHaving a strong brand also helps you to build a good reputation. Whether you are starting out and have no reputation at all, or are looking to improve the profile you already have, a successful brand can help. It’s all about building expectations about your services or products, which in turn can encourage your staff to exceed them as they are motivated to live up to the name you have nurtured.\\nWhy is small business branding important?\\nThe most successful companies keep branding at the very heart of everything they do. It is a way of defining your business’ identity; understanding exactly what your business is about, what it looks like, sounds like and how it appears to your customers. Not only will it keep your customers coming back for more, but it will also ensure that your employees feel more at home and loyal.\\nHere’s a few more reasons why branding is important for your small business…\\nRecognition – When you see some of the most famous logos in the world, you instantly know the name of the company, what they do, and what they stand for. Whilst you may not achieve that status straight away, by having a strong brand you will start to build a reputation that people will recognise you for.\\n\\nTrust – Speaking of reputation, appearing professional and consistent in your branding improves your credibility amongst customers.\\nBeing found – If you sell offline as well as online, having a well-established brand helps potential customers to find you wherever they may go.\\n\\nLogos are a good place to start. Your logo must represent you; tell people who you are, show the type of company you are, and communicate your values clearly all in one. It’s a tough balancing act to perfect, but it can be done.\\nHere are a few things to keep in mind…\\n\\nName and tagline – We may be stating the obvious, but make sure the name and slogan are clearly visible. That way your customers will remember your name and it becomes far easier for them to talk about you to other people.\\nWhat do you do? – Does your logo represent the services or products you provide? Your potential customers should be able to know they are in the right place at a single glance.\\nShow your personality – Maya Angelou once said “At the end of the day, people won’t remember what you said or did, they will remember how you made them feel.” How do you want your customers to feel when they see your logo? Home in on one particular emotion to avoid confusion, whether it’s fun, approachable or emphasising the fact that you’re experts in your field, otherwise you may be forgettable.\\n\\nFinding your brand’s voice\\nSome of the biggest and most well-known and liked brands out there all have one thing in common: they have a very distinct voice. For example, a luxury watch brand like Rolex is known for being classy and upmarket. Red Bull is daring, adrenaline-spiking and exciting. On the other hand, one brand who does social media particularly well, is Innocent; their Twitter is fun, cheeky and they write the way they speak.\\nA perfect branding isn’t something that you can achieve overnight, but it is something that you should put a great deal of thought into. While larger companies are, of course, able to spend more on their branding efforts, it doesn’t have to break the bank! Slapping your logo on everything you produce just won’t cut it anymore; your voice and message must be strong, consistent, and connect with your target customers. Nail this and you’ll have them coming back for more!\\nAbout the author: \\nPhil Foster is Managing Director of Love Energy Savings.

Through the eyes of children, parents and teachers, Mark Robinson explores the life-changing effect that learning to play music can have on children, demonstrating the principles behind his unique method of teaching.\\nAs a lifelong music teacher, both in schools and privately, Mark discovered first-hand how traditional methods of learning an instrument were failing many children. He recognised that music is better when taught in a way that builds the whole child and not just their musical ability, and through Learn to Play the Rocksteady Way reveals why.\\nMark founded Rocksteady Music School in 2007, guided by a combination of his own experience, philosophies on music education, and the feedback of thousands of children, parents, musicians and school teachers. Now delivering in-school music sessions to more than 4500 children each week, Rocksteady enables primary school pupils to experience the buzz of being in a band from the moment they pick up an instrument.\\nBy learning music as a group activity, children are given the opportunity to have fun, develop socially and learn to understand the importance of teamwork and collaboration.\\nMark comments: “I saw for myself that music as it’s traditionally taught – learning to read music, the need for children to own an instrument and the pressure of exams – wasn’t working for a lot of children. I spent years listening to what children were actually motivated by, which was playing their favourite songs, playing in a band and performing in concerts, and distilled these principles into a teaching method. \\n“Along the way, we’ve found that our way of doing things has a very positive effect on confidence, listening and teamwork skills. I wrote the book because whenever I spoke to parents, teachers or new members of staff they were fascinated and wanted to know more – the book put these ideas in one place and is available to anyone. Education needs to be relevant to the children, as straightforward as possible and be built around their motivations. That’s what we set out to do!”\\nLearn to Play the Rocksteady Way is aimed at parents, teachers and musicians who believe learning music should be fun!

Everything arrived on time which helped us to meet the tight deadline for the build. The client is very pleased with the finished laboratories.”\\nCeiling contractor, A.S. Crocker Plasterers recommended Knauf AMF for the project as Director Phil Wilson explains:\\n“We have worked with Knauf AMF products in the past and found them to be keenly priced, able to deliver on time and always fulfil the given criteria. I have no problem recommending Knauf AMF and their products.”\\nThe laboratories are large areas fitted with a number of hard materials, including glass and concrete, which can create poor acoustics. To counter this, Knauf AMF baffles were installed to provide the necessary sound absorption, helping reduce the level of reverberation and improving speech intelligibility. The baffles are a versatile solution for controlling sound. By varying the distance between the rows of baffles, or changing the size of the baffles, different acoustic performances can be achieved. Knauf AMF baffles are also ideal for enhancing acoustics in thermal mass areas or where frequent and unhindered access to services is required.\\nEach baffle consists of two sound absorbing panels sat back-to-back in a frame. The panels are durable and offer excellent fire resistance. The surface is smooth and has an elegant appearance.\\xa0 For design freedom, both the frame and the panel can be specified in a range of colours. Each baffle is suspended by discreet cable hangers which creates the impression of a weightless, elegant structure, enhancing the modern design of the laboratories.\\nThermatex Alpha Hygena suspended ceilings are installed above the baffles to provide additional Class A sound control. The smooth white surface gives these ceiling tiles an elegant appearance that fits aesthetically with the interior design of the laboratory. Hygena has an anti-microbial coating which can resist bacteria and fungi making it an ideal ceiling for hospitals, healthcare facilities, kitchens and laboratories.\\nKnauf AMF have years of expertise of working with projects that have complex specifications and tight deadlines.

The two-storey building will be delivered in less than six months from receipt of order to be open in time for the school’s first intake of sixth form students in September this year. Cranage of the refurbished modular structure is being timed for the school holidays to minimise any disruption to teaching.\\nThis is Foremans’ 11th school project with education construction consultants Surveyors to Education who are designers and contract administrators for the scheme.\\nThe building will feature large amounts of glazing for a high level of natural light, with brick cladding to complement neighbouring facilities, and areas of bright red rainscreen cladding to reflect the school’s colours.\\nCommenting on the project, Ben Elliott, Director of Corporate Services at Higham Lane School said, “There is a shortage of quality sixth form provision in our area and feedback from students has indicated a strong preference to stay on and study for A-levels at Higham Lane School.”\\n“The Foremans pre-owned approach offers us significant benefits – it is very cost effective and the building will look brand new once it is completed. It is giving us more certainty to have the new sixth form up and running by September because the majority of fitting out takes place off site. Knowing that Foremans is a member of the Portakabin Group gave us even greater peace of mind along with their excellent relationship with Surveyors to Education.”\\nMartin Hier, Director at Surveyors to Education said, “The school wants this to be a statement building which will also blend in well with existing facilities. It is designed to meet the specific requirements of sixth form learning, which includes teaching spaces to accommodate smaller groups.”\\n“We have a strong and long-standing relationship with the Foremans team and enjoy pushing the boundaries on each new education scheme we collaborate on. We take a standard building solution and enhance it to meet the school’s requirements – whether that is for aesthetics or as here, specific classroom sizes.”\\n“We would definitely recommend recycled modular buildings to other schools and colleges. The approach is very sustainable because we are re-using an existing building structure – which is still in perfect condition, and at the same time we can reduce lead times and carbon emissions. Foremans modular buildings are also really flexible so layouts can be reconfigured to meet changing local needs.”\\nThe Higham Lane sixth form centre will accommodate up to 300 16-19 year-old students and will have 17 seminar rooms, an art room, two science laboratories, and common room with café area.\\nForemans’ 10 previous projects with Surveyors to Education have included a two-storey school complex at Billingbrook School in Northampton and a single-storey community college building with five classrooms and an IT hub at Winstanley College in Wigan.\\nFor further information about refurbished Portakabin buildings, visit www.foremansbuildings.co.uk, email info@foremansbuildings.co.uk, or call 01964 544344.',\n"," 'Portakabin, the UK’s leading supplier of interim modular buildings, has successfully constructed and handed over a complete new 300-pupil interim primary school in Devon in less than four months. \\nWorking in partnership with architects and project managers, Atkins, Portakabin provided more than 1,200sqm of primary teaching accommodation for the relocation of Dartington Primary School. The scheme will be in use for the next two years and was configured as 13 school buildings and three toilet blocks with disabled access.\\nThe project was delivered on time in a challenging timescale despite exceptionally high levels of rainfall during the programme, and the green field site immediately adjacent to the original school was highly constrained which made the building installation phase more complex.\\nThe modular buildings have been configured to create a village feel and a welcoming environment for children with imaginative age and function-related play zones. Facilities include a kitchen fitted out with the school’s own equipment, a music room, library, pre-school nursery, 11 classrooms, and an administrative building for the staff room, head teacher’s office, general offices, sick bay, toilets and school reception.\\nJill Mahon, Head Teacher at Dartington Primary School, said, “We are very happy with the buildings. The classrooms respond to the needs of the children and promote the flow of learning. The teaching areas have been configured in clusters to provide learning that is appropriate for each key stage and so that children can interact and learn from and with each other.”\\n“The classrooms are light, airy and calming with a friendly, positive feel. Everything on the new site works really well for our school and our style of learning. Other teaching professionals who have visited have also been very impressed.”\\n“Externally the layout of the buildings has been carefully designed so our children can learn outside the classrooms as well as inside. The whole interim school was constructed very easily and the area will be turned back into a field when we move to our permanent school. Parents really are amazed by the quality of the facilities and cannot believe these are interim buildings.”\\nKevin Presland, Principal Architect and Project Manager at Atkins said, “Portakabin offered us the solution which would provide the least possible disruption to the school and I am pleased to report this has been successfully achieved and in a really ambitious timescale.”\\n“The buildings are flexible in their design and address the school’s specific requirements. We worked really well in partnership with the Portakabin team to find the optimum building solution and valued their fast and responsive approach to help us meet the urgent need for these facilities.”\\nThe buildings arrived on site around 80 per cent fitted out, with partitions, plumbing and electrics pre-installed to reduce lead times. All internal fitting out was carried out by Portakabin and included provision of magnetic white boards for visual learning displays, access ramps, entrance canopies, and security and data communications.\\nThe provision of high quality interim teaching accommodation allows schools and LEAs to react quickly to local needs and to provide alternative facilities for pupils when it is necessary for building projects to continue during term time.\\xa0 By providing classrooms of the very highest standards and with a design life of at least 60 years, buildings from Portakabin help to ensure that there is no compromise on the quality of the learning environment.\\nAs at Dartington Primary School, the facilities can be configured and fitted out to the exact requirements of each individual school – as learning clusters, standalone teaching blocks and generously-sized, light, modern classrooms. The buildings can be linked to existing facilities; the floor area can be increased or reduced in line with local demographic needs, and the accommodation can remain in use for as long as needed.\\nFor further information about interim education buildings for primary and secondary schools, visit www.portakabin.co.uk, email information@portakabin.co.uk or call 0845 401 0010.',\n"," 'Thousands of secondary aged pupils are expected to tune in to a virtual Shakespeare lesson next week when the BBC and the RSC join forces to deliver Shakespeare: Text Detectives – the first Live Lesson about Shakespeare for secondary school aged pupils.\\nIn the month that marks both Shakespeare’s birthday and the 400th anniversary of his death, the 45 minute Live Lesson will take place on Monday 25 April at 11am.

However, unless you are willing to travel the world in search of snowy runs throughout the year, your best bet to find the best ski conditions are to stick within the traditional ski season.\\nThe skiing season runs from December to April in most ski resorts, especially those throughout Europe. However, you can find good deals and snowy mountains as early as November and as late as May, before the lifts shut for the season, if you are willing to search high up in the mountains. This is usually only a good idea for more experienced skiers as the beginner runs are usually found lower down the mountain where the snow can be wet and slushy in these months, if there is any snow at all at that time.\\nThe ski season\\nThe skiing season truly start in December but even at this stage, not all low and even medium altitude ski resorts will be guaranteed to have snow.

We have a National Curriculum to ensure each student receives a particular level of education, by outlining structures within each subject on what children should be taught. In order to keep up with some of the best education systems from around the world, the National Curriculum changes every now and again to ensure future students receive the best possible education.\\nThere has been a new approach to the National Curriculum over recent years; it now sets out the core knowledge that pupils should learn, but doesn’t necessarily specify any approaches in how teachers should teach. This appears to have now been left up to the discretion of each school that follows the National Curriculum.\\nFor over 20 years, the National Curriculum has been revised and over the next couple of years there are a number of changes to be put in place, including some changes that have already happened.\\nSubject area: Geography\\nThere have been a number of differences in the way Geography is now to be approached in the National Curriculum. It was decided that there would be a renewed emphasis on both locational and place knowledge, as well as the human and physical processes. Alongside this, some technical procedures should be covered such as using grid references.\\nThere should also be a renewed commitment towards the concept of fieldwork and the use of maps, as well as written communication.\\nKey Stage 1 Geography\\nThe National Curriculum includes certain topics that should be included, but not necessarily how they should be taught. For example, the focus at key stage 1 should be developing knowledge about the world, the United Kingdom and their locality. Pupils at this stage should be taught certain facts such as the world’s seven continents and their locations, and naming and identifying the four countries and capital cities of the UK. Trips to London may include extra curricular education that can aid pupil’s understanding of the United Kingdom.\\nIn terms of human and physical geography, pupils should be able to identify seasonal weather patterns and identify hot and cold areas of the world. Pupils at key stage 1 should also be able to use world maps and globes to identify the UK and other countries or oceans studied at this stage.\\nKey Stage 2 Geography\\nAs they progress, pupils should be expected to extend their knowledge to include Europe, North and South America as well as significant human and physical features. Pupils should be able to identify the position of latitude, longitude, Equator and other large features of the world such as the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.\\nPupils at key stage 2 should now be taught more physical geography including the climate zones, biomes and features such as volcanoes and earthquakes. Trips to destinations such as Iceland could encourage further learning about some of the world’s physical geography.\\nThere is a huge emphasis on geographical skills at this stage; pupils should be able to use the eight points of a compass, four and six-figure grid references and keys on Ordnance Survey maps in order to build on their knowledge.\\nKey Stage 3 Geography\\nKnowledge at this stage should include Africa, Russia, Asia and the Middle East, with a focus on their environmental regions such as deserts as well as major cities. Visiting places such as Morocco is the perfect place for curious geographers, with the Sahara Desert on your doorstep.\\nPhysical geography should concentrate on geological timescales and plate tectonics and the change in climate over the years, from the Ice Age to the present day. There should also been some emphasis on how human activity relies on effective natural systems, and how human and physical processes interact to influence and change landscapes and environments.\\nPupils at key stage 3 should be able to collect and analyse geographical data, and build further on their knowledge of globes and maps.\\nOf course, one of the best ways to enrich the National Curriculum, especially with Geography, is to visit such major cities and key physical characteristics. Taking an educational trip to further pupils’ understanding of the world they live in would provide a unique experience to enhance their learning. Using a company that organises such trips, like Adaptable Travel, could provide a once in a lifetime opportunity for many students up and down the country.',\n"," 'Altro safety flooring and hygienic wall cladding are providing the highest standard of safety, hygiene and aesthetics for athletes at the University of Bath’s renowned £30 million Sports Training Village (STV).\\nThe STV is an indoor and outdoor facility that accommodates more than 50 sports and regularly hosts major international competitions, as well as being a world-class multi-sport training environment. There has been major investment in improving the facilities at the STV, including a £1.6m refit to the swimming pool, which included Altro WhiterockTM hygienic wall cladding in the changing area.\\nMore recently, Altro Whiterock was chosen again, alongside Altro AquariusTM safety flooring, for the refurbishment of the dry changing areas.\\nSTV Sports Facilities Manager, Ron Stewart, explains why Altro has been selected for these projects. “The University has been using Altro Whiterock for many years as standard in its shower areas, so we know that it’s a great product — superb quality, easy to clean and with a contemporary look.\\n“We didn’t hesitate in choosing Altro Whiterock for the swimming pool wet changing refurbishment. The existing walls were a very poor quality laminated product which looked pretty dreadful. The Altro Whiterock was a huge improvement, as we knew it would be, and has made all the difference in terms of creating a cleaner, more modern-looking space, quality and easy maintenance.”\\nAltro Whiterock White is the hygienic alternative to tiles that’s impact resistant, grout-free and easy to clean. Its smooth white surface and classical purity make it a timeless choice for any interior. Made from a high-quality, food-safe PVCu polymer, Altro Whiterock can handle temperatures up to 60°C. It meets all current European Union (EU) Directives on health and hygiene.\\nRon continues: “For the refurbishment of the dry changing area, Altro Whiterock was number one choice again, but we also needed to find a much better quality vinyl safety flooring, because what we had was terrible. It was costing us a fortune to patch up because it kept cracking, and the joints were failing. We wanted a serious upgrade in quality, a modern product that looked great, and something that would stand the test of time and be easy to clean.\\n“Our project manager gave us a range of samples to assess, but he very much recommended that Altro Aquarius was the right product for us, because of its safety properties for combined wet and dry areas, colour choices, and proven track record in similar environments.”\\nAltro Aquarius was developed to deliver optimum slip resistance in combined wet and dry areas, with shoes or bare feet — so it’s ideal for bathrooms and changing areas. Like all Altro safety flooring products, Altro Aquarius offers sustained slip resistance for the lifetime of the product, keeping your risk of a slip to just one in a million. The 2mm range features plain and tonal chip options, including an on-trend indigo shade to help achieve high contrast and design flexibility. It’s also easy to clean, with Altro Easyclean Maxis PUR technology.\\nThe Altro flooring and hygienic wall cladding was fitted by Quadrant Contract Flooring, who have use Altro products for more than 20 years. Quadrant Contracts Director Simon Allan, says: “In the past 10 years we have added Altro Whiterock to our portfolio, alongside Altro flooring, because we were getting so many enquiries that it made sense to offer both as part of our service.\\n“We specify Altro for the majority of our work because we believe it’s the best on the market. It’s British-made, so supply is always good, and the support we get from Altro is great.\\n“The installation of Altro flooring in the changing areas wasn’t without its challenges. The area was redesigned to be open plan, but the floor levels were not uniform, which meant we had to do a lot of work to ensure they were even. There were also some moisture issues, which required laying a dpm. Like all Altro products, Altro Aquarius is very easy to work with, and goes down well. We used AltroFix 19 Plus adhesive to lay the flooring.\\n“The Altro Whiterock fitting went well too,” adds Simon. “It was a two-phase operation, but it’s a quick product to put up, so despite a very tight time schedule we were able to finish on time — fitting 214m2 in one week using a two-part joint system.”\\nIkon Construction were the main contractor for the refurbishment at the STV. Operations Manager Mike Clements said: “We were very pleased with the quality of Quadrant’s installation of the Altro flooring and wall cladding. We work a great deal with Quadrant on a wide range of projects and they are always professional, co-operative and deliver a superb result.”\\nRon Stewart adds: “I am delighted with the Altro products used. The installation was handled well and was delivered to a very short working window.\\n“The Altro Whiterock looks great, we will continue to use it and recommend it wherever there is a need here. It’s so easy to clean as well, which is major bonus for our maintenance staff.\\n“The Altro Aquarius looks perfect, the colour is just right, it’s feels great underfoot and the feedback has been very positive about every aspect of it, including the cleaning regime. It is certainly proving to be exactly the right choice, and has helped transform our changing areas into something we are really proud of.”',\n"," 'On 17 November, Ogilvy & Mather Group UK’s Vice Chairman, Rory Sutherland, will kick off BIMA’s Digital Day at one of the participating schools in London with a 20-minute presentation to students.

This year we are urging teachers, pupils and school councils to once again consider participating in our very special anniversary fundraiser.\\n“Just by wearing jeans and making a donation, schools have already helped us to raise millions of pounds to provide vital care and support for children with genetic disorders. To mark our 20th anniversary, we’re asking pupils and teachers to go the extra mile and do something extraordinary in jeans to improve the lives and experience of children and families affected by genetic disorders.\\n“Throughout September we expect to see denim fever sweep across the country as high profile celebrities and schools get involved and show their support. We’re excited to announce a team of synchronised swimmers will be performing in jeans as well as a ballet house rehearsing Swan Lake in denim.”\\nDo something extraordinary in jeans by celebrating 20 years of Jeans for Genes Day.

Almost 100 metres of paper were used to make the boat – that’s the length of a football field.\\nThe Big Bang Fair invited Morwenna Wilson, a direct descendent of Isambard Kingdom Brunel who is herself an award-winning engineer, to captain the boat on its maiden voyage.\\nMorwenna works for Argent in London as a mechanical engineer, and is currently leading several major projects at London King’s Cross Railway Station.\\nMorwenna Wilson said: “Engineering runs in my family, and I really want to show young people that this career can open doors to amazing opportunities and adventures. From creating a huge origami boat, constructing a new skyscraper, or designing an aeroplane, so many things we travel on, live in or use in our everyday lives involve engineering.”\\nA team of engineers worked on the project, and due to its vast size had to make certain modifications to the traditional paper boat model. To ensure that the boat was stable enough that it didn’t capsize when someone stepped on it, a keel made of wood was added underneath the boat.\\nFor safety, a polystyrene block was also added into the supporting pyramid, and ridged paper in the base of the boat created a platform strong enough for someone to stand on.\\nThe team also used a specialist paper which is stronger and more water-resistant. This was necessary as it was in the water for much longer than a standard small-scale paper boat.\\nYear 10 pupil Daniella Jennings, 15, from Tottenham UTC, London said: “It was cool to see how they managed to make a huge version of the kind of paper boats you can make at home. I didn’t even realise that was something engineers could do!”\\nPaul Jackson, Chief Executive of EngineeringUK said: “The Big Bang UK Young Scientists & Engineers Fair is passionate about showing young people the exciting and rewarding opportunities there are for them in careers in the sciences and engineering.\\xa0 We hope that The Good Ship Big Bang will excite children to consider\\xa0new ways of thinking to develop solutions to the way we live our lives in the future.”\\nThe Big Bang UK Young Scientists & Engineers Fair takes place at NEC, Birmingham from 11-14 March 2015.\\xa0 To register or for more information visit www.thebigbangfair.co.uk.\\nFor a full step-by-step guide to creating your own small scale version of this origami paper boat, visit: www.thebigbangfair.co.uk/origamiboat',\n"," 'In the summer of 1940, during WWII, nearly two million children were evacuated from their homes as war broke out and British and German airplanes fought overhead in the Battle of Britain.

heritage.\\nScotland’s top young pipers and drummers are starting to gear up for the world’s largest schools pipe band competition – which this year comes with a twist.\\nThe Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships (SSPBC) features an innovative ‘Freestyle’ category which aims to show how traditional piping and drumming can be combined with other musical instruments to create a modern take on pipe music.\\nThe event will see the musicians – with some swapping their pipes for a piano, guitar or even bongo drums, midway – perform tunes under the theme ‘anything goes’, ranging from Scottish melodies, songs from musicals and hits from One Direction.\\nDavid Johnston, Chairman of the SSPBC committee, said the Freestyle competition is unique in the world.\\nHe said: “The Freestyle category is all about the traditional pipes and drums – but with a twist.\\n“It offers a chance for pipers and drummers to let loose from the rigid competition format to perform some more modern pieces in a relaxed atmosphere.\\n“We decided to introduce this category as a way of highlighting the versatility of the pipes and drums alongside other instruments which we think will encourage schools to get creative, as well as adding a quirky twist to the event.\\n“It means that schools can look to use their whole orchestras and young musicians to compete in a novel competition.\\n“This category is all about injecting some fun into the competition and showcasing the outstanding musical talent of our younger generation, regardless of what instrument they play.”\\nAlready seven schools have entered for the 10 slots available in the Freestyle category, who will face a judging panel consisting of some of Scotland’s most senior Pipe Majors, as well as Craig Munro from Scottish piping favourites The Red Hot Chilli Pipers.\\nElsewhere, entries are starting to flood in for the SSPBC which takes place on March 8 at Broughton High School and Fettes College in Edinburgh.\\nThe deadline for entries closes on 26 January and the SSPBC committee is keen to encourage more schools to sign up.\\nLast year, more than 600 students from nearly 100 schools competed in the event which aims to showcase the need for Scottish schools to offer pupils the opportunity to play Scotland’s famous national instrument.\\nDavid added: “We want to prove to schools, education authorities and parents, that learning Scotland’s most iconic musical instrument can not only teach our kids important skills but it can build self confidence and can instil a sense of pride in younger generations.\\n“Year on year the numbers for the competition keep growing and we have seen everything from juniors to seniors from a wide and diverse range of schools take part.\\n“It’s a real thrill to see the level of interest amongst younger generations rise around an instrument that plays such a significant part in Scotland’s musical heritage.”\\nFor more information or to sign-up to the competition, visit the SSPBC

it be incorporated simply and practically into teaching and learning?\\xa0 Educators across the UK can now expand their skills by taking part in an innovative and flexible new CPD programme from Into Film, an education charity supported by the BFI with Lottery Funding.\\xa0 The programme will provide a range of strategies to develop literacy, filmmaking and employability skills, and raise attainment in reading and writing using the engaging and thought-provoking medium of film.\\nDeveloped in collaboration with a range of partners including the BFI, the Bradford Media Literacy Project, NI Creative Learning Centres and a wide variety of subject associations and CPD practitioners, the programme consists of two key strands: Literacy CPD designed to improve literacy through the use of film as text, and Filmmaking CPD designed to enhance curricular learning through the use of filmmaking.\\xa0 Training is available free for groups of 15 participants or more, with sessions ranging in length from 30 minutes to a full day and tailored to meet the needs of individual schools.\\nInto Film’s Literacy CPD demonstrates the benefits of using film as text to develop learners’ critical thinking, analytical and contextualisaton skills – skills equally applicable to and transferable between film and literary texts.\\xa0\\xa0 Educators are introduced to the key concepts of colour, character, camera, story, setting and sound – the 3Cs and 3Ss – and how learners can use these to analyse and decode film and other texts.\\xa0 Activities – designed to suit different age-groups – \\xa0\\xa0include games and activities to develop identification and analysis of different camera shots, learning how to construct a story and use character analysis in scriptwriting, analysing use of sound, expressing thoughts and opinions on a piece of film and exploring mise-en-scene.\\nThe Filmmaking Programme emphasises film as a teaching tool to encourage deep and active learning across a range of subjects and facilitates young people taking control of their own learning processes. \\xa0\\xa0With a firm focus on filmmaking without specialist equipment, sessions range from Record and Playback, ShoeBox Set Design and Introduction to Animation, to 5,4,3,2,1 – a framework for simple filmmaking using tablets, flip cameras or smartphones.\\nTeachers already working with film have welcomed its positive impact.\\xa0 In a recent survey \\xa096% said their students were more engaged with the curriculum, 86% said their students were more imaginative and creative, 76% said their students had improved speaking and listening skills, 74% said their students had improved critical thinking and enquiry skills and 72% said their students had improved literacy skills.\\nAccording to Colm Hackett of\\xa0Hazelwood Integrated College, “Using film to teach improve literacy promotes a more democratic and inclusive method of teaching. We, as teachers, have to meet the challenge of engaging all children.

The Programme will provide a framework to improve literacy by working through five steps from diagnostic to leadership and skills assessment, and the approach will draw on community resources, families and students’ passions and interests.\\nThe National Literacy Trust has also been commissioned by Oxfordshire County Council to work with a cluster of secondary schools over two years, as the “Oxfordshire Gaining Momentum Campaign”. The Campaign seeks to address the county’s above average gap in attainment between disadvantaged and other pupils, with a focus on students in Years 7 and 8.\\nJonathan Douglas, Director of the National Literacy Trust says: “We are delighted to be launching our new school improvement programmes which will enable us to achieve our ambitious vision for secondary school improvement. Thanks to The JJ Charitable Trust and Oxfordshire County Council we will work with secondary schools to embed literacy as the driver for improving attainment at GCSE level.”\\nMark Woodruff, Executive of The JJ Charitable Trust says: “Literacy is one of The JJ Charitable Trust’s main concerns and for years we have worked with charities to prevent and overcome poor access to literacy that too often sees children and young people fall prey to low educational attainment, low employment chances and even homelessness and prison.\\n“We have turned to the National Literacy Trust for a creative new approach to young people’s inclusion in literacy that gives them a powerful place at the heart of their own education.

However, the research found that student age respondents worry they may not be equipped with the relevant skills to make the most of those opportunities.\\nAsked what digital means to them from a personal and professional perspective, 75% of 12-17 year olds believe that digital technologies will give them more job opportunities than they would otherwise have had. Half say digital will help them get their “dream job”, while 67% also recognise they will be competing for new roles, such as data scientists that are being created as a result of all organisations using digital to re-imagine how they operate their business.\\nAlthough this age group are digitally literate and socially connected, they fear that their education isn’t providing them with the right skills for these new roles. Two thirds (65%) feel that the current curriculum is not developing or enhancing their digital skills adequately.\\n“It’s good news that young people feel optimistic about the opportunities digital offers, but the fact that they don’t feel they are being fully equipped is worrying. After all, they are the next generation of our workforce and the future of British business is in their hands,” said Nick Millman, managing director, Accenture Digital. “We know that jobs will look different in the future as a result of digital, and yet it seems that even the positive changes already made in classrooms and the curriculum such as the introduction of coding, still may not be enough. We need to give young people the confidence to contribute to organisations that want to become fundamentally digital.”\\nDigital inspires\\nWhile there is more to be done in the classroom, it is clear that people of all ages in the UK believe digital drives opportunities in the workplace. Half of those people surveyed said that digital will enable them to be more productive (51%), creative (48%) and more flexible, with 54% saying work will be able to happen irrespective of location.\\nMillman explains: “At the heart of this report is a desire to give businesses visibility of what is really going on in the world around them. Too few have fully embraced and adopted digital and it is crucial that they mirror the passion and energy felt so strongly by their next-generation workforce. It is only by carving out a digital strategy relevant to young people to become digital on the inside, that organisations can ensure they continue to succeed and shape the future.”\\nUse Digital to reinvent the workforce\\nDigital will transform the lives of younger generations. Parents believe digital will give children more opportunities than they would otherwise have had (74%) and that jobs will be enhanced (78%), which could be driven by advances in cognitive computing. Over half (56%) of all respondents agree that humans should instruct machines to do as much as possible, leaving humans to do more of the interesting and innovative roles.\\n“In order to realise the full potential of a workforce, businesses need to augment manual tasks, as well as automate the less creative ones,” Millman concludes. “The fact is, digital technologies have the ability to transform both personal and professional worlds, allowing all of us more flexibility and choice in the way we work, but crucially also more options about the tasks we are asked to perform. Organisations need to get better at presenting themselves as digital enablers, reassuring potential employees that their lives will be enhanced because the business has implemented technology appropriately.”',\n"," 'Big Yellow Friday, the national awareness and fundraising day for Children’s Liver Disease Foundation (CLDF) has proved increasingly popular with schools over the past couple of years.

High Values will encourage UK pupils to understand the importance of these values and how they translate to everyday life.\\nPupils will be taught about RISE using four supporting films, featuring current and ex-servicemen and women. These films will be available online and on a DVD that teachers will receive as part of their free resource pack when they register.\\nBy the end of the programme, each pupil will make a pledge on the High Values website to demonstrate which value they will embrace and live by at home, at school and in their community.\\nThe programme is open to all pupils aged 7-12 across the UK, so if you know someone who you think would enjoy learning about these High Values, encourage them to speak to their teachers.\\nAll participating schools have the opportunity to request a visit from a current or ex-serving serviceman or woman, where available. They will be fully briefed before the decision to visit is agreed. The request must be submitted during the start and end dates of the programme which will be between September and December 2014.\\nThe programme will inspire over 170,000 pupils across UK schools and expose them to RAF and RAF Association branding and values. This will prompt a greater understanding in becoming advocates for fundraising and support in their communities in the future.\\nThe pupils will also be placed into a prize draw to win RAF Association merchandise or even an exciting RAF experience for their class.

Raising money for the Fairtrade Foundation will help farmers to earn a fair price for their work, as well as a little extra – the Fairtrade Premium – which is invested for instance in clean drinking water, healthcare and education for children in the community.\\nSchools have been a big part of the Fairtrade movement.

There is a slight dip at A*-A of 0.3 percentage points to 26.0 per cent and at A*-B of 0.5 percentage points to 52.4 per cent.\\nThese are the first set of results since A level and AS qualifications effectively became linear through the complete removal of the January series in England and its removal for AS in Wales and Northern Ireland (see point 5 in Notes to Editors). The changes could lead to variations within schools and colleges, depending on how they previously entered students for examinations. For example, if they traditionally used the January series for resits they may see greater volatility than schools who usually entered students in a linear fashion.\\nNottingham High School pupils and staff celebrate a great set of results for the school\\nStudents are increasingly choosing Facilitating Subjects, with entries rising in Biology, Chemistry and Physics by 2.0 per cent (combined); Mathematics 0.9 per cent; and Further Maths 1.5 per cent. English entries are down 4.6 per cent but greater decreases can be seen in non-Facilitating Subjects such as General Studies (down 24.3 per cent) and Political Studies (down 10.6 per cent).\\nAlthough French, German and Spanish all had fewer entries than last year (down 7.4, 0.1, and 0.6 per cent respectively), as a proportion of all UK entries there is stability. The proportion of candidates awarded A* in these modern foreign languages increased (0.1 percentage point in French, 0.7 percentage point in German; and 1 percentage point in Spanish).\\nResults for other Facilitating Subjects also remain relatively unchanged, with the majority increasing at A* but declining marginally at A*-A. For example, in Biology the percentage of awards receiving an A* increased 1.4 percentage points to 9.4 per cent, but at A*-A declined 0.8 percentage points to 27.5 per cent. There are several factors that could possibly be contributing to this pattern in results, such as teachers adopting new strategies in response to the removal of the January series; a slight shift towards Facilitating Subjects affecting outcomes at grade A; and as the A* continues to bed in it becomes more important for highly selective universities and as such provides a greater incentive for students.\\nAS\\nResults for AS qualifications remain stable with a 0.1 percentage point increase at A to 19.9 per cent and a 0.5 percentage point increase at A*-E to 88.8 per cent. The overall increases in AS entries may be due in part to there being no resit opportunity in January; however, the data does point to the EBacc, a GCSE performance measure introduced in 2010, having an impact on post 16 subject choices with increases in Geography, Spanish and History.\\nExtended Project\\nThe Extended Project continues to be popular with students and universities with a significant increase in entries of 9.4 per cent from 2013. This builds on a 6.4 per cent increase in that year.\\nCommenting on the results, Michael Turner, Director General of the Joint Council for QualificationsCIC said:\\n“Although the system has undergone change, this year’s national results are very stable. As ever, students and teachers across the country have worked hard to achieve them and should be congratulated for their efforts and the fruits of their labours.\\n“It is possible that due to the removal of the January series some schools and colleges may experience volatility in their results, depending on how they have adapted to the changes. But it is important to remember that standards have been maintained and, despite the changes, are comparable with previous years.\\n“The increase in the number of students taking Spanish and some other EBacc subjects at AS will be welcomed by many and it will be interesting to see if these rises follow through to next year’s A levels.”',\n"," 'Temperance charity BNTL produces teaching resources for Key Stages 1, 2 and 3 aimed at helping teachers to educate the children in their care about alcohol and drugs.\\nThe resources are neutral, relying on evidence and facts about the negative effects drugs have on the human body.\\nIn the past BNTL Freeway has distributed a copy of resources free-of-charge to every primary school in the country. “But, inevitably the resource becomes the property of one teacher, they move schools and the resource is lost,” says Peter Swales, chairman.

For them to hear and learn from people working in industry about the exciting and challenging experiences they’ve had on a practical level and about how important security is has made a huge difference. It really makes them think about how they can use the skills they’re developing at school in future careers. The practical experience of using the Raspberry Pi’s and practising with the programming has been really beneficial. We have a number of students who are very interested in applying for the competition and developing something of their own.”\\nTim Anderson, commercial director, Portcullis says: “There is a definite gap in the education sector with students missing the fundamentals of coding and programming. A lot of young people think they are good with computers but when it comes to understanding how computers work, we have a lot of passengers and not enough mechanics. Many kids lack the skills to do anything tangible with what they know\\n“The Portcullis team has a genuine passion for technology and the industry in which we operate, and we’re delighted to be able to use this opportunity to encourage secondary schools and students to explore the opportunities that programming can present in advance of the new computer science syllabus launching in September.”\\nParticipating schools will have until November 7 to finalise their entries, which will be judged at the end of the month at Portcullis’ Watford offices. First prize is a trip to Bletchley Park, while second and third prizes will be Raspberry Pi based.\\nWith only 10 spaces in the competition interested schools are encouraged to get in touch with Portcullis as soon as possible to secure their place.

At ARK Kings we are committed to providing the best possible musical education – music is a life skill that can open new doors and expand the horizons of our most talented young people”.\\nNathan Portlock is the specialist teacher appointed to lead on guitar skills. He said, “It’s great to be involved in such a ground-breaking initiative. I’ve worked in music education for over seven years and I’ve never come across a school programme like this. It’s exciting because it provides every pupil aged 11 to 13 with a place where they can learn to compose, collaborate, play and even record new original music. Too often musical interventions in learning are short term affairs that target a small number of pupils. This approach creates healthy competition across the entire year group – it is said that talent is universal but opportunity isn’t – not at ARK Kings!”\\nThe Band Musicianship Programme has been so successful that it will continue next year and incorporate the new Year 7 intake so that it spans Years 7-9.

Training begins in October and allows students to ‘earn whilst they learn’ and train for a well paid and exciting career on superyachts, which typically sell for over £100million.\\nThese Yachting Cadetships for 18-25-year-olds are generously part funded by two of the leading UK maritime charities, which makes them accessible to everyone and an immediately viable option for those considering vocational training over the more traditional study or career paths.\\nSix of the bursaries are available via Trinity House and amount to £17,880 of assistance/funding (£3,000 is towards the Foundation Degree in Year 2 and the rest for the first phase of training at UKSA’s Isle of Wight campus). But hurry as you’ve only got until mid July to apply for these six!\\nAlternatively, another six are available from Seafarers UK, at £10,500 for the 5-month phase one training (£2,000 of which is from the Milo Hanlon* Bursary). You have until mid September to apply and be selected and priority will be given to those who display a clear welfare need and/or have a proven family connection to the maritime industry.\\nUKSA Cadetship Manager, Emma Baggett, explains: “With expensive tuition fees and graduate unemployment rates, vocational training has definitely become the new university – and ours is particularly in demand because of these bursaries on offer.\\xa0 Our yachting cadets can easily graduate debt-free because of what they earn during what amounts to some two years of paid work placements, plus food and accommodation is included in the cost of training. Once onboard a vessel almost all of the student’s living costs are covered by the yacht too.\\n“With the help of Trinity House and Seafarers UK, aspiring young captains can now take the first step into this unique career path, because the work placement phases – entry level professional deckhands can typically earn €2000 a month tax free (not including tips) working in locations across Europe and the Caribbean – are a proven means of funding the rest of the cadetship\\n“We currently have some150 cadets at various stages of their training working in the industry and it’s our global relationships with crew agents and captains themselves that make the cadetship so successful. This support, which carries on throughout their careers, is unique to UKSA.\\n“The FdSc Foundation Degree was recently granted full-time status and can now be applied for through UCAS, plus successful 2014 cadets will be able to drawn down on student loans to assist them further – as well as taking advantage of all the other associated benefits that full-time students enjoy. Consequently, it’s become an internationally recognised qualification that will not only shape and reinforce a young crew’s career path, but also offer a transferable qualification for later life.”\\nApplicants should have obtained at least 120 UCAS points (or the equivalent in work experience) and have high grade passes in GCSE Maths and English. You must be seeking a genuine alternative to university and also demonstrate a keen desire for a long term career in the superyacht industry – and whilst previous water sports and/or yachting experience is highly desirable, it is not essential.\\nFor further cadetship bursary details contact UKSA’s career advisors on 01983 203038, or email careers@uksa.org. For those not accepted onto their chosen bursary, there is the option of a Career Development Loan worth up to £10,000 – and the rest contributed by the student.\\nOther routes via a career development loan include the 23-week Professional Yachtmaster Ocean course (£14,995), which is basically the first two phases of the cadetship. This is increasingly proving popular with the older generation too, who have a spare six months through redundancy, early retirement or a lifelong desire to try something different, but can quickly recoup the costs via a profession that offers very well paid starter salaries.\\nUKSA’s six-week Crew Training for 18-25s is the most simple and cost effective way of gaining employment as a deckhand or crew on yachts of all sizes, including superyachts. It costs just £3,995 (you would spend the same on a basic plumbing course, stuck at home, in your local college) but once employed students can typically earn enough money in a year to fund the cadetship.\\nIf you want to skipper your own yacht, work with charter and flotilla companies, carry out short haul deliveries, or teach yachting, then Professional Yachtmaster Offshore opens doors to the whole industry. This 13-week intensive course costs £7,250, is world renowned, and also attracts 25-30 year old manager types, looking for a career change, but entry at the appropriate level. As an example, those working on decent sized charter boats can generally live on tips alone and double a circa £30,000 per annum salary that could remain untouched in the bank.\\nFor those more suited to working below deck, or attracted to glitz and glamour, UKSA’s Superyacht Interior Foundation course (just three weeks long and only £2,600) is a whistle stop tour of working in the uber rich and cool superyacht industry. It will equip you with all the hospitality and personal skills needed to excel in the playground of the seriously wealthy, together with the essential safety training required for work on board.\\n*Set up in honour of former Seafarers UK cadet Michael ‘Milo’ Hanlon who tragically died aged 22 whilst pursuing his superyacht dream in the South of France. It’s an interest-free loan and recipients simply agree a realistic and achievable repayment schedule, so the bursary continues to be available.',\n"," 'The Association of Educational Psychologists (AEP) has warned that the lack of a sufficient supply of educational psychologists in schools settings will be detrimental to special educational needs (SEN) proposals currently being outlined, despite welcoming the Government’s acknowledgement of the essential role that educational psychologists play in the lives of children and young people with SEN.\\nIn response to the publication of the SEN Code of Practice for parliamentary approval by the Department for Education, the AEP has stressed that an uncertain funding future for the initial training of the educational psychology workforce and the ever increasing demand for educational psychologists’ posts will mean that there will be an insufficient number of educational psychologists supporting local authorities and schools in future, which could put the wellbeing of vulnerable children and young people across the country at risk.

For the launch the Macular Society has partnered with VivoMiles.com, a schools’ reward platform with 1.4 million users and a proven track record in bringing campaigns like this to millions of students. A questionnaire on attitudes to smoking will be included in the campaign which at least 20,000 children are expected to complete.\\nConsultant ophthalmologist, Phillip Moradi, from Moorfields Eye Hospital in London conducted the survey and will analyse the new data.\\nHe said: “We need to have better information on which health messages will work with children. At the moment 600 children in the UK start smoking every day. That represents a devastating effect on the health of these young people later in their lives. It may seem logical to concentrate health messages on the life-threatening consequences of smoking but it may be that raising awareness of the risk of blindness would be more effective.”\\nThe Society is criticising the slow progress in implementing an EU directive to put sight loss warnings on cigarette packets which was first agreed in 2012 and says current smoking advice often ignores the link with blindness.\\nTony Rucinski , Chief Executive of the Macular Society, said: “We are failing children if we don’t tell them about the full dangers of smoking. Smokers are up to four times more likely to develop macular degeneration than people who have never smoked. Smokers with certain genetic characteristics are 20 times more likely to get it. The fact is that macular degeneration is the biggest cause of sight loss in the UK. 200 people a day start to lose their sight because of it. Children are, rightly, concerned about the prospect of living with sight loss but adults seem to overlook this when planning anti-smoking campaigns. Anti-smoking messages must highlight the risk to sight.\\n“We recognise that teachers play a vital role in presenting effective health messages to children. I hope the exciting teaching resources combined with the videos we have created will help to inspire people within the education sector to get involved with the campaign.”\\nThe resource packs offer activities, tools and inspiration for educators to teach young children about the dangers of smoking and the increased risk of blindness in later life including:\\n\\nA Fact-Sheet about macular degeneration, its symptoms, causes and a series of interesting facts and figures to start conversations about what causes blindness.\\nKS3 suggested lesson ideas in the areas of Art and Design, Science and Personal Social and Health Education (PSHE) as follows:\\n\\nArt: exercises to help children understand and empathise with people affected by the condition\\xa0 by visualising the impact central sight loss would have in the way they interact with their everyday environment \\nScience: Ideas and information on how to incorporate macular degeneration into science lessons and the study of the eye.\\nPSHE: A lesson plan to explore the link between smoking and blindness and the emotional and social implications sight loss can have for people \\xa0\\n\\n\\nFilm making competition tools – a guide on how the Is it real? film competition can be incorporated into lessons. In this competition children are encouraged to develop a 16 second film inspired by a series of quotesabout how people with thecondition see the world.\\nMake your own simulation specs – a maker’s pack for children to create their own simulation specs and truly understand how it feels to have macular degeneration.\\nStop smoking hints and tips – information and facts to help children, friends or a family member to stop smoking.\\n\\nThe campaign was devised in collaboration with Commonland, the design research specialist and was the result of workshops to explore children’s understanding of macular degeneration.\\nGeorge Lee, founder of Commonland, said: “Young people don’t like being told what to do and traditional health warnings rarely work. During our research we realised most young children do not know about the link between smoking and blindness. Working closely with Macular Society we wanted to engage young people in the experience of macular degeneration by sparking their curiosity and empathy for people with the condition in a format they would feel compelled to share with others.”',\n"," 'KS3 music teachers across the capital will be taking part in the first cohort of The UK Association for Music Education (Music Mark)’s new CPD programme later today (13th June).\\nPeer-to-Peer offers teachers the chance to learn how to improve their teaching from an expert panel of colleagues who’ve demonstrated excellence in their schools.\\nMusic Mark’s Teaching & Learning Coordinator James Devaney said: “Teachers will get to chance to talk to other music teachers and together, improve and empower their departments.”\\nFunded by the Mayor of London and the Department of Education, the free programme also\\xa0 includes mentoring, twilight networking sessions and access to an online network to share ideas and receive additional support.\\nMusic Mark’s General Manager Jem Shuttleworth said: “We’re very excited about Peer-to-Peer; it will offer an opportunity to connect practitioners across London to share their excellent practice and expertise.”\\nThe second cohort of Peer-to-Peer begins on 26th September.\\xa0 Registration closes on 12th September so further details can be found at:\\xa0  www.musicmark.org.uk/training-events/peer-to-peer-programme-2014-2015',\n"," 'Over 100,000 children from over 600 schools across the UK took to the streets\\xa0yesterday as part of the Giant Walking Bus, an initiative coordinated by Brake, the road safety charity, and webuyanycar.com. The event aimed to give children a voice, calling on drivers and government to make their streets safer for walking and cycling, to enable them to live healthy, active lifestyles.\\nIn a survey by Brake and webuyanycar.com of almost 5,000 children taking part in the event, they expressed their wish to get out and about more on foot and bike, and for safer streets to allow them to do so. The survey found:\\n·\\xa0Three quarters (76%) of students would like to walk and cycle more, to get to school, go to the park, or to see friends.\\n·\\xa0More than half (56%) worry they might be run over by traffic when walking or cycling on roads.\\n·\\xa0Four in five (81%) think drivers should go slower around their school or home.\\nWith childhood obesity on the rise – three in 10 (28%) children in England aged two to 15 are overweight or obese -it is more critical than ever that children can live more active lifestyles. One of the simplest ways to achieve this is to build active travel into their everyday routine – and as Brake and webuyanycar.com’s survey shows, the kids themselves want to walk and reclaim the streets.\\nHowever, with 33 children killed and 1,836 seriously injured while walking or cycling in Great Britain in 2012 alone (latest figures) many parents are understandably fearful to let their children travel to school, the park or friends’ houses this way. Almost half (44%) of primary school children are now driven to school impacting on children’s health and contributing to congestion and traffic danger.\\nBrake is calling on drivers and government to take action to make streets safer for kids and help them enjoy a healthy, active, happy childhood, by backing Brake’s GO 20 campaign. For drivers, this means slowing down to 20mph or less wherever there may be people on foot or bike, and always keeping a look out for vulnerable road users. For government, this means implementing widespread 20mph speed limits in towns, cities and villages – one of the most effective measures identified by the World Health Organisation to reduce pedestrian casualties\\nJulie Townsend, deputy chief executive, Brake, said: “The thousands of kids out on the streets yesterday should send a clear message to everyone: kids want to be able to get out and walk and cycle, and by not making our streets safe, we are denying them the fun, active childhoods they deserve. This has serious implications for their long-term health and wellbeing, the burden on our NHS, the environment, and our society as a whole. If we are going to create an environment fit for our children we need to put them – not motor vehicles – first. We are appealing to drivers to slow down to 20mph or less around homes, schools and shops, to local authorities to continue rolling out 20mph limits, and to national government to make 20mph the national urban default. We need to make sure our kids and people of all ages – not just the lucky few – can walk and cycle without being endangered.”\\nRichard Evans, campaign spokesperson for road safety at webuyanycar.com said: “Children want to be active and it’s our responsibility as road users to ensure they feel safe. Being able to cycle or walk to and from school should be a childhood right, not a luxury. We want yesterday’s event to work as a wakeup call to drivers – children want their roads to be safe and it’s our privilege, at webuyanycar,com, to help the voices of over 100,000 children be heard.”',\n"," 'Apps for Good has today announced the finalists in the national Apps for Good Awards 2014, designed to inspire students and discover the country’s leading young digital entrepreneurs. The Awards will be held on 23 June 2014 at the Barbican, London.\\nThe national Apps for Good Awards celebrate the next generation of problem solvers and digital creators: students who have created an app that tackles an everyday problem or issue they are passionate about.

Through this we are empowering young people to make the most of the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. We would like to wish all of the shortlisted teams good luck for the Awards!”\\nThe winning app teams will be selected at the Apps for Good Awards event, taking place from 6-8.30pm on 23 June 2014 at the Barbican, London.',\n"," '‘The war to end all wars’ is the subject of a new free project being launched this week by creative curriculum writers, Cornerstones Education. Fallen Fields has been designed to help school children study World War One in its centenary year.\\nPrimary schools across the country – whether they already work with Cornerstones or not – are being offered the free teaching and learning resource via the educational supplier’s website.\\nTeachers will be able to use the project to help children learn about the causes and effects of the conflict sparked by Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s assassination on June 28th 1914.\\nCornerstones curriculum director Melanie Moore said: “The First World War was called the ‘war to end all wars’ and its massive historical significance is being commemorated all over this country this year in its 100th anniversary. Children will be seeing a great deal about it on television and in their communities.\\n“We want to help schools plan and prepare learning experiences which will enable pupils to investigate every aspect of the First World War in a sensitive and thoughtful way.”\\nThe limited-edition project aimed at ten and eleven-year olds (Upper Key Stage 2) will help teachers plan a wide range of cross-curricular learning opportunities.\\nFallen Fields includes facts and figures about the First World War, as well as many suggestions for activities such as trips to war memorials and museums, online research to find old newsreel footage and photographs and interviews with family members to ask if they have stories passed down about the 1914-1918 conflict.\\nIt encourages pupils to work together to create timelines, maps and newspaper articles; to plant poppies and to study war poems, paintings and songs. The project even provides a step-by-step guide to help the children organise their own Remembrance Day commemoration event.\\nMelanie said: “It is important younger generations develop knowledge and understanding of this hugely significant and complex period in our history and we are offering this dedicated project free to all schools to help them get the most out of this learning experience.”\\nThe Fallen Fields project follows the creative learning format of all Cornerstones imaginative learning projects which means it is designed to help children think for themselves; encouraging them to engage, develop, innovate and express themselves, while at the same time meeting all learning requirements of the new National Curriculum 2014.\\nThe free sample project also includes access to ready-made learning resources prepared by Cornerstones such as presentations, song lyrics and maps as well as images, poems and website links.\\nFallen Fields is also suitable for Year 7 pupils at secondary school.\\nTo download Fallen Fields, visit:  http://www.cornerstoneseducation.co.uk/Free-resources.aspx.

Over £170,000 was raised in total in aid of Beanstalk, an exceptional children’s literacy charity. The event was sponsored by wealth management firm Vestra Wealth LLP, without whose personal support the event could not have taken place.\\nSpeakers included\\xa0HRH Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands, UNESCO’s Special Envoy on Literacy for Development, Boris Johnson, Mayor of London and the charity’s ambassador and author Paul Connolly.\\nBeanstalk is also extremely fortunate to have as their patron, The Duchess of Cornwall. As a mother and grandmother, she is extremely familiar with the energy and expertise that Beanstalk generates to help tackle illiteracy in the classroom.\\nThe ball, a first for the charity, aims to continue raising money for its work in supporting children who struggle to read. Last year Beanstalk’s worked with 7,350 children across England in over 1,100 schools through the help of over 2,300 reading helpers. The charity aims to help 18,000 children struggling with their reading by 2018 and urgently needs more volunteers.\\nFollowing a champagne reception, guests enjoyed a delicious dinner with a whirlwind of magical entertainment, under the aegis of Toby Young, founder of the West London Free School and Master of Ceremonies. As ever, Lord Archer was a superb auctioneer and spun his own magic to elicit some fantastic bids!\\nSue Porto, Beanstalk’s CEO, said: “It was fabulous to witness the fantastic generosity and spirit on the night. Funds raised will help to drive the charity forward so that we can reach out to more children, to ensure that no child grows up without the skills they need to read, grow and succeed.”\\nDavid Scott, founding and senior partner of Vestra Wealth, said: “We are proud supporters of Beanstalk, having started a four-year commitment as their corporate partner in 2011. We decided to sponsor tonight’s function to ensure that all the money raised could go directly to Beanstalk. We hope that you will join us in supporting a very worthwhile charity that will change many lives and give young people a foundation to build on.”\\nGuest of honour HRH Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands called upon Mayor Boris Johnson to team up “on a European bicycle tour” with Beanstalk and herself as the founder of the Reading and Writing Foundation to expand the success of the ‘Get London Reading’\\xa0 campaign across\\xa0other European countries.\\nShe said: “Time has come for such a campaign since it is a shocking fact that even today one out of every five Europeans – both adults and young people – does not have the literacy skills to participate fully in society. Only joint commitment across society, ages and political timetables can create the literate environment and the quality of learning we need to ensure people are happy, healthy and employable.”\\nBoris Johnson responded very positively to the invitation of the Princess, embracing her wish to raise awareness on literacy. Boris shared a personal anecdote of being left behind in the reading stakes when, at the age of six, he was told that his younger sister Rachel was a better reader. With typical insouciance, Boris blamed the reading material (Peter and Jane) and revealed it was ‘The Cat in the Hat’\\xa0that inspired his love of reading.\\nThe Mayor also said: “I want every child in London to leave school with the ability to read and although the situation is improving, still 1 in 5 children finish school without the basic literacy skills necessary to set them up for life. Through my education programme we are working to raise attainment levels further and charities like Beanstalk have a vital role to play.”\\n“I am delighted to see how much money has been raised by Beanstalk’s recent charity ball, which will help hundreds more children, and I hope supporters continue to dig deep to ensure the continuation of this excellent work.”\\nIn an emotional concluding speech, Paul Connolly, who suffered abuse in an East London children’s home and who only learnt to read at the age of 25, urged guests to support Beanstalk in their efforts to give children the opportunities that his peers tragically missed out on.\\nwww.beanstalkcharity.org.uk',\n"," 'Online vocabulary learning application, Vocab Express, has been announced as a partner, alongside Speak to the Future and Oxford University Press for the Language Show Live’s Strictly 1000 Words competition.

we support them is solid mr hildrey added i am delighted with the appraisal received and it reaffirmed our own evidence that the school is outstanding particularly in the most complex area of positive

child they work with although birth to matter build on previous nonstatutory guidance for the eyfs it ha updated all the material to reflect research evidence and meet the need of practitioner today it outline the foundation of good practice and offer information and guidance for practitioner to consider how the principle of the eyfs can be brought to life in their setting new section on play characteristic of effective learning and selfregulation are designed to help practitioner to reflect on and develop their own pedagogy the guidance includes detailed example of trajectory of development and learning in all the prime and specific area say nancy stewart project lead the need for this information to support child development knowledge came through very clearly in our consultation but she caution that a new mindset is needed across the sector to move away from a checklist approach that take practitioner away from being with child if setting have been using previous

school a safe reopening during the ongoing pandemic can only be achieved with a robust riskreduction strategy that cover all transmission route since one of the primary way that covid is spread is through the air by aerosol airborne liquid particle that may carry infection keeping these particle out of the nearby air by regularly introducing clean and fresh air into communal space ventilating is vital for preventing the spread of disease so how do you ventilate space effectively and how do you know if ventilation practice are even working the uk government scientific advisory group for emergency sage along with the chartered institute of building service engineer cibse uk and the federation of european heating ventilation and air conditioning association rehva europe have issued guideline on how to improve ventilation in room their advice includes opening window ensuring regular break for occupant and increasing mechanical ventilation all three report also highlight co monitoring a a key tool for any effective ventilation strategy both to help improve ventilation and to help ass it efficacy why is co monitoring important feeling that a room ha become stuffy or feeling drowsy after hour sat in a meeting room are sensation that are familiar to manyand theyre caused by a buildup of co just like co aerosol carrying infectious disease that are exhaled by occupant will linger in the air without sufficient ventilation the longer that a room is occupied the greater the volume of infectious aerosol that will build up and the greater the risk of infection it is possible to evaluate the level of ventilation available in a room just by assessing how occupant are feeling for example if a person perceives that a room feel stuffy they may proceed to open a window to increase air flow rate however this method is ultimately reliant on guesswork and occupant may not be able to detect simply by feeling alone when extra ventilation is needed until it is too late monitoring co level eliminates guesswork from ventilation assessment and enables a systematic approach to increasing ventilation by accurately measuring the volume of co in the air co monitor provide hard evidence of when extra ventilation is needed which might be a long time before occupant feel that the room could do with some fresh air the report from sage identifies that co monitoring is particularly important in workplace and school where it is most likely to be an effective indicator of ventilation rate in space that are used for extended duration by group office and classroom co measurement reflect the air quality with a greater accuracy and give a good indication of ventilation condition by contrast co monitoring is not a effective at indicating ventilation rate in large volume or low occupancy space where airflow and dispersion of occupant may vary in these area however sage still recommends aiming to keep co level low below ppm a a good rule of thumb how to improve ventilation with co monitoring after establishing what ventilation is available in a room co monitor should be used for two purpose to alert when extra ventilation is needed to evaluate the efficacy of ventilation co monitor should be placed on an inside wall with sensor facing away from window or grille so that the reading are a accurate to the inside condition a possible it is also recommended that they are placed in visible position c off of the ground so that responsible person can easily act upon their alert alarm show when extra ventilation is needed alarm on co monitor can alert occupant of the immediate need to increase ventilation in a room by signalling that the co concentration ha exceeded acceptable level a a visual indicator co alarm also help to boost awareness of the importance of ventilation the cibse report suggests that involving school pupil in responding to co alert can help to increase ventilation efficacy by improving awareness the report suggest that alarm should be set to alert when the co concentration measure at or above ppm if or when an alarm is triggered action should be taken to immediately increase air flow into the occupied space opening high window is an effective strategy especially in colder month a it will sufficiently increase ventilation rate while not significantly lowering room temperature or causing a draught for school with mechanical ventilation system the report recommended maximising fresh air flow at all time take informed action with longterm recorded data with data logger co level can be recorded over time so that data can be viewed and analysed and further action taken based on this evidence data from co monitoring should be used to ass whether ventilation measure are taking effect timestamped data from one room might show that instance of increasing natural ventilationfor example by opening window or doorsis effective at lowering co level for a different room with different dimension and different available ventilation route analysis of data may reveal that there is a need to implement more significant measure to fully protect the health of occupant room which are shown to regularly record above ppm should be identified and prioritised for improvement to ventilation a further advantage of monitoring with a co data logger is that longterm recorded data can provide evidence of the need for significant or structural change to be made helping to support funding application the tinytag co data logger robust easytouse and quick to deploy the tinytag co data logger is a simple and effective solution for indoor air quality monitoring using a selfcalibrating nondispersive infrared sensor ndir the data logger accurately measure and record carbon dioxide concentration with outstanding longterm stability the tge model measure from to ppm and is ideal for measuring indoor air quality in busy classroom or office a model measuring up to ppm is also available for more specialised application the data logger ha an led on it front which will flash red when an alarm ha been triggered enabling responsive action to high co level the data logger can be wallmounted or placed on surface to continuously monitor co concentration wherever is required compact and lightweight the logger can be situated anywhere where there is a main supply and can easily be transferred between different location for versatile monitoring throughout a building data is offloaded and viewed in userfriendly tinytag explorer software where it can then be exported to thirdparty programme in a variety of popular file format xml csv txt for further analysis and presentation gemini data logger also offer a certificated calibration service that is traceable to national standard co data logger can be calibrated prior to shipment or returned to gemini at any time for calibration while low level of co are a good indication of effective ventilation they are not confirmation of low aerosol transmission by themselves other transmission factor including occupant density occupant duration and the type of activity being performed in a room should also be taken into account when assessing transmission rate a good covid risk management strategy should also comprise mitigation effort for other transmission route for example maskwearing social distancing and reducing occupancy

it challenge but one thing we wanted to focus on from the start wa staff satisfaction to help ensure we were an employer of choice one thing we learnt early on wa that the academy vision mission and aim were key in joining the school together so we ensured these were not just on poster and in marketing but spoken about in performance management covered at key event such a our annual staff conference and included in our strategic plan going from just per cent of staff agreeing or strongly agreeing that they understand the academy strategy in to almost per cent at the end of is an

the fact we have managed to improve these result further is testament to the joinedup approach we promote job satisfaction ha also improved and a key thing that ha been a driving force behind this is how we have improved the working environment at each school thanks to how we have handled our finance since becoming an academy we have invested hugely in technology with laptop now being replaced every three year the installation of promethean whiteboards in every classroom and each school receiving new led lighting all made possible by making saving through rationalising the supplier base and bringing service such a catering and it inhouse a key part of setting up the academy wa gaining the trust of our staff and it clear from our result that we have made huge progress particularly in the last two year when we have seen some dramatic increase in employee satisfaction this improved mindset within our staff mean we are able to deliver a better provision for our child providing them with better life chance which is what we strive for patrick added our next step will be improving communication with employee across all level even further by implementing a new staff intranet site a well

accident if that device is connected and synced to onedrive a part of the school office account a ransomware file can be automatically uploaded to onedrive and encrypt school file and data held in the microsoft cloud ive also seen example where sharepoint exchange and other data source have been hit and if network drive are mapped to document library in office using the open with explorer feature the ransomware can also scan for and infect file on connected drive despite these example many organisation still labour under the misapprehension that they dont need to worry because the data hosted in their office cloud is protected by microsoft in our own survey nearly of respondent said they believed that microsoft provides everything they need to protect their office environment yes microsoft doe have some limited feature to restore deleted file but surely it doesnt need to be said that recovering deleted file from the recycle bin in onedrive isnt a recommended backup strategy neither is email archiving which doesnt allow you to restore a complete mailbox and all of it content to a single point in time it may be buried in the term and condition but even microsoft recommends that

lower achievement in both reading and math a a likely result of missed learning in addition there is a large and concerning attainment gap between disadvantaged pupil and nondisadvantaged pupil this study is one of the first to provide robust insight into the extent of learning loss that might have occurred a a result of partial school closure it is based on data collected by the national foundation for educational research nfer from assessment in reading and math taken in november by more than year year old pupil in representative primary school these were compared with test taken by year pupil in autumn also from a representative sample of school overall performance in both reading and mathematics in autumn wa found to be significantly lower compared to the cohort with pupil on average making two month le progress in both subject area compared to the standardisation sample worryingly the study find that a very large number of pupil were unable to engage effectively with the test the study also find a large and concerning gap between the attainment of disadvantaged pupil and nondisadvantaged pupil for both reading and math this gap is estimated to be the equivalent of seven month learning while both calculation indicate a large gap the result expressed in term of month of learning should be interpreted with caution the nfer assessment data did not compare the performance of disadvantaged pupil with all other pupil a a result it is not known if the gap ha grown compared to these interim finding are part of an ongoing eeffunded study further analysis will be

compelling evidence of what we have feared since school were closed to most pupil in the first national lockdown that there will be a large negative impact on learning with disadvantaged pupil suffering the most despite the inspiring and tireless work of school across the country this will only be compounded by the current partial school closure it is vital therefore that we draw on the

ultimately economic prosperity through increase in uk workforce productivity government can seize this opportunity iop recommends by building a worldclass system of subjectspecific cpd to ensure that all teacher are able to improve their subject knowledge throughout their career such a system would provide all student in all school with access to highquality subject teaching this would increase the number of welleducated student and consequentially increase overall uk economic productivity the iop say it would also reduce the current disparity of academic performance between uk region

mathematics score wa not significantly above year girl score the report also highlighted significant gender difference in attitude towards math and science in both year group and subject boy were significantly more confident and liked learning more than girl boy also valued both subject more in year which wa the only year group asked about how much they valued the subject significantly more girl than boy were not confident andor did not like mathematics and science for example looking at year pupil confidence in mathematics significantly more boy said they were very confident compared to girl compared to coauthor dr tina isaac ucl institute of education added the timss data enables u to draw comparison between the attitude of boy and girl in each subject in their respective year group and to compare england gender difference with those of other country despite social concern about the difference between boy and girl performance the result show that theyve performed largely at the

to use them there wa a similar caveat for tutoring the programme we reviewed had an impact on learning and achievement but successful intervention tended to be structured and designed around specific need and involved regular session lasting a term or longer the review made five key recommendation develop practitioner understanding of how child learn mathematics dedicate time for child to learn mathematics and integrate mathematics throughout the day use manipulatives and representation to develop understanding ensure that teaching build on what child already know use high quality targeted support to help all child learn mathematics other teaching aid highlighted in the review included computerassisted instruction and explicit teaching researcher found a large body of evidence demonstrating that intervention delivered through apps or computerassisted instruction or where guidance from teacher is high can have a positive effect on childrens attainment in mathematics however

the working paper is published today by the nuffield foundation who also funded the report it analysed data from the teaching and learning international study talis and included survey answer from teacher in five predominantly englishspeaking education system from england australia albertacanada new zealand and the united state the study highlight that teacher across england work some of the longest hour in europe and recent research by the ucl institute of education found that a quarter of teacher work more than hour a week lead author professor john jerrim ucl institute of education said our study show that is it not just a case of saying extra hour lead to extra stress among teacher but what they are doing in those hour we found that for every extra hour teacher spend on marking and planning there is a significant association with decline in wellbeing at work this is most likely because these are often task done at the evening weekend and during school holiday we also found that other aspect of the job such a extra time spent teaching or working with colleague and undertaking professional development appear to have little direct effect upon the quality of working life the study also found the relationship between teacher working hour and their wellbeing may not be linear for example if teacher worked hour a week adding an extra hour or two may not lead to serious consequence however for those working hour a week an additional hour or two of work could be the straw that break the camel back explained professor jerrim additionally the paper also highlighted the inequality in hour worked and level of wellbeing experienced by fulltime teacher the finding suggested that fulltime primary teacher in england who work hour per week could increase this to or even hour with little effect upon their workload stress and wellbeing at the same time a reduction of five or ten hour amongst those teacher who currently work or more hour per week might potentially lead to an appreciable increase in this group quality of life coauthor dr sam sims ucl institute of education added our finding have important implication for education policy there are two clear area where reducing teacher workload would help reduce stress lesson preparation and marking with respect to the former perhaps the easiest thing that policymakers can do is dramatically reduce examination curriculum and inspection reform all of which create new work for teacher who are forced to change lesson material and teaching style a a result j jerrim s sims teacher workload and wellbeing new

session teacher will receive training to teach medieval african kingdom and explore a wide range of topic area for all key stage of student the online session will be a collaborative space where teacher from across the uk can exchange idea and resource for teaching african history in secondary school and sixth form the session are designed to broaden the parameter of the curriculum and student sense of british history reexamining prevailing assumption about national identity and belonging a principal goal will be to widen the scope of black history that student are exposed to traditionally british school have only taught african history through the perspective of european colonisation the issue with such a narrow segment implies that africa wa ahistorical prior to european discovery propagating a false perception that no noteworthy event discovery or civilisation occurred there the african study centre hope to challenge this narrative of africa by exploring it history that predates colonialism and explore how african civilisation recorded and told their own history the idea of opening an african study centre at the college wa conceived by carina ancell and alan

volunteer in the international brigade during the spanish civil war carina ancell history lecturer and honour programme manager at newham sixth form college said a far a we are aware there are not currently any school or college in london offering a comprehensive super curricular african study programme a such this is a real opportunity to develop expertise amongst the capital teaching community whilst developing student interest in and appreciation of african history prior to choosing gcse option the national curriculum dictate that in key stage pupil should be taught a syllabus

migration reported a desire for additional training on teaching about migration and on teaching about empire the new african study centre at newvic will provide a muchneeded infrastructure of support so that more teacher are given the tool they need to tackle these subject according to carina ancell all teacher regardless of cultural background must be encouraged to engage with this important section of history we believe that it is really important that teacher who may not have a background or specialism in african history feel confident and supported in delivering material on this topic the hope is that the african study centre will broaden the history taught in school and change perception and public knowledge of what the history of the british people actually is alan kunna history

mate what can the cat do to help your child do better at school will the presence of a rabbit floppy ear make your youngest become a better listener all question youve probably never asked yourself or anyone else but the truth is having pet in the home can teach your child some valuable and positive life lesson which they can carry forward into adulthood here a glimpse into the wisdom your faithful pet could be passing on to the kid a sense of responsibility you understand the burden of responsibility that come with owning a pet for example the major financial responsibility that come with purchasing and maintaining a healthy animal and the rigour of it exercise routine feeding time and so on and so forth that financial responsibility stretch over the animal lifetime so make sure you check your finance before going ahead and adding a new member to your family while your child might not get absolutely all of the background stuff that go on with keeping a pet they can gauge the sense of responsibility required to look after a loved one you can help them learn by giving them ageappropriate task such a getting little one to look for when the dog water bowl is empty or letting older child to help with the feeding process learning compassion and enhancing communication most household pet are highly emotionally intelligent animal dog in particular display their heart on their sleeve best and daytoday interaction with animal can help teach your kid the basic of compassion and communication understanding when a pet is happy or sad excited or angry in distress or want something this is all based on learning your pet behaviour and action just like you the kid will get to understand this better a time go on understanding the limit of communication in play and learning to work around it to develop a better relationship reducing stress and behavioural issue study have shown that child of family with pet generally have better health are more active and struggle le with behavioural and learning issue not to mention are generally le moody too this however is likely down to better socioeconomic circumstance rather than the animal themselves but the use of animal a therapy pet suggest there is a stress reduction and therefore behavioural improvement attached directly to owning a pet encouraging a healthy lifestyle owning a pet is fun but it also pretty tiring at point so why not let the kid take over with the exercise element from time to time whether thats them accompanying you out walking the dog on a day or running around with the cat in the living room owning a pet that need to stay active encourages your kid to do the same when people come to get a pet the psychological benefit one would provide for their child probably isnt the top reason for getting one there is however a lot of evidence to say that owning a pet can help your child develop some fundamental life skill which is an added bonus to have a cute cuddle companion

educational visit closing their venue and losing whole team of staff and volunteer with no overnight visit since march and for the foreseeable future the provider of residential learning experience

bring some normality back to student life and build confidence in undertaking educational visit further a field such activity are essential for young people in term of broadening their horizon and to help accelerate their learning we also need insurance company to cover educational visit for covidrelated cancellation without this teacher arent able to plan ahead which is further affecting the

especially when working within a team however automation make recruiter life a lot easier they can work faster have more data to work with and can spend more time focusing on the right candidate instead of sorting through unsuitable cv automation also cut cost in way that can have longterm effect making it even more valuable to use in the first place if the hiring process is quicker and the candidate are better suited then job satisfaction for recruiter and their new hire will increase this mean that employee retention can become higher and creates a better culture within the company a

be seen by thousand of people everyday it also mean that application number have skyrocketed but in reality only of job applicant get interview by using automation to identify the best candidate an enormous amount of time can be saved both for employer and potential employee prescreening software can also reach out to successful and unsuccessful candidate a soon a the decision ha been made building relationship quicker than with a manual process which can lead to a more satisfying job search it is also more effective at storing information meaning that when strong candidate arent chosen this time they can be easily reconsidered for another position when it come along this build a connection with candidate and a better brand for the company which in turn encourages passive applicant to become active and answer the job advert put out better reach there a lot of information out there so job advert can get easily lost in the traditional space and with low unemployment rate there is a good chance that a great candidate for the position is only passively looking for another job this mean theyre not scrolling through job listing for hour but theyre open to a new opportunity should it make itself available around of recruiter use linkedin and other social networking site like twitter and facebook are becoming the goto place to find job since these site collect a huge amount of data from their user their targeted advertising algorithm are pretty accurate and can help put advert where they are more effective this is where programmatic job advertising come in all recruiter need to do is input their parameter and need into the software the budget for advertisement number of applicant wanted and what the target demographic is then the computer doe the hard work advert pop up across the web tracking down site that may be niche but the people that visit them may better match the demographic for those likely to be qualified for the job this is like a webwide targeted ad and company have reported that using these software ha reduced cost by per qualified candidate embracing automation automation is changing every aspect of our life including the hiring process so embracing technology and the benefit it can bring will help company perform at their best in the modern age technology ha made u more connected meaning that hiring ha become more competitive for both candidate and employer company like picked are using ai to improve the matching process a ai software like picked continues to improve hiring can become faster cheaper more accurate and even more

get a business idea off the ground but actually networking and partnership is a valuable tool for your business throughout it growth not just at the start of the journey building a business based on a network can be a solid business strategy to take and here how you can do it too look close first we have heard about the rule of six degree of separation where everyone in the world is somehow connected via six contact well this is even smaller in business it surprising who you can find mutual connection with on networking platform such a linkedin or even closer to home with family and friend everyone know somebody and that somebody may be the key to unlock the next stage of your business journey you could meet anyone from a potential investor a valuable freelancer to the latest member of a sale team however on the flipside of being only a few introduction away this mean that you need to be ready to share your pitch at any moment traditionally your go to would be an elevator pitch in theory short enough to pitch whilst travelling a few floor in a lift but you can take it that step further by condensing down your business proposition and benefit to just one sentence it easy to get caught up in the detail especially if you are passionate about your business however everyone wont need or be interested in the finer detail consider how you would explain your business to an eight or eighty year old and you wont go far wrong look for expert it well documented from some of the world greatest business leader who have credited part of their success come from hiring people who can do what they cant and that is vital when building your network often business are looking to venture in new market when growing this is a natural step for a business to take but in order to achieve this you need local expert and skill whilst you can identify other market potential a a business whether in europe or further afield you wont have local knowledge the small and what may seem insignificant regional nuance can often put a halt to either setting up a base in the region or hiring the right team this is a recipe for failure and your venture to new market will be short lived therefore it worth looking to build your network based on local expert who can help guide you in those early day to provide longevity a your business grows look for middle ground once you are building your network think about mutual exchange and championing them where possible often a personal recommendation can go a long way or perhaps an introductory meeting with a new contact considering what you have to offer a a business whether thats office coshare space or joint partnership on project to support your network is a big factor in a world where our online brand is a important if not in some case more important than our offline brand social medium and website are key can you conduct a blog exchange with someone in your network that your target audience might find beneficial or can you share upcoming event to your network which might help expand contact for all party involved overlooked for more pressing business action actually conducting regular social medium activity will

actually qualify you for a certain job straight away such a nursing or teaching and others will give you a good degree that show you are a dedicated individual that can achieve something postgraduate university degree if you want to study further at university then a postgraduate degree is just that one undertaken after graduating from an undergraduate course these are generally divided into a one year master degree or a phd doctorate which is a research degree where you are adding a useful contribution to the academic world and will be able to use the title of doctor on completion college traditionally college may have been thought of a a lesser form of learning than university but it really just study with a different aim and outcome you are more often studying a vocational

'a new campaign led by university of sussex academic is urging teacher and pupil to be allowed to embrace uncertainty and explore new way to engage with knowledge transformin education is designed to support teaching staff and pupil to have time and space within the day to break with convention which the campaign founder dr perpetua kirby and dr rebecca webb believe is necessary to ensure a creative and critical society where everyone is better able to respond to life situation where the answer is not always clear dr kirby and dr webb are looking to work with school and other educational institution to support them to look beyond conformity within the school day which they define a only learning what others already know to pas exam the academic believe that while it is important to value existing knowledge it is also vital to explore different way of thinking and doing thing dr webb a lecturer in early year and primary education at the university of sussex said in our current education system child become successful by acquiring lot of curriculum knowledge and behaving in particular way teacher who by implication must never not know and deviate from always explaining what thing mean this mean constantly and continuously working ever harder to fill more efficiently and effectively the pupil with certain knowledge we feel that this a really optimum time to launch this it feel like there could be a positive reception for new thinking within the sector higher education encourages student to engage in transformative disruptive thinking it certainly something we have put at the heart of what we do at the university of sussex and so it imperative that school follow suit the campaigner say they want to help influence a change of policy on a national level and broaden the current model of education they have observed during indepth research in school which they say assumes certainty about the knowledge presented to student with very little time or opportunity for uncertainty they warn that there is currently too much emphasis on pupil conforming to the standard of good behaviour of prolonged sitting in silence and working hard to find the correct answer their research highlight that being good can camouflage an avoidance of effort for some pupil including engaging in new and unexpected challenge where the answer is unclear dr webb and dr kirby stress the importance of having higher expectation for pupil that go beyond simply learning what is in the curriculum to create new knowledge this includes sharing opinion questioning the way thing have always been done pursuing new question and experimenting with different approach their study identify that pupil are already working with uncertainty but mostly alone without the support of a teacher university of sussex master pupil mariyam ahmed toor identifies the limit of current schooling for her generation she said we dont understand that it okay to feel uncertain and to not have answer all the time in fact somewhere along the way we were taught in school that uncertainty is bad which is so ironic because life is anything but certain and so instead of feeling liberated in our s we feel overwhelmed and unsure because every move we make need to be grounded in certainty transformin education will bring together academic and nonacademic stakeholder especially teacher parent head teacher and student at school and college to promote more and better opportunity for different way of experiencing knowledge in school it founder hope to offer a forum to draw on the talent and expertise of teaching staff who they say do not currently have the opportunity to step outside existing demand within school the campaign will organise and attend event for researcher and teaching professional to explore the balance of conformity and transformation in schooling including the tension in pursuing both goal dr kirby an associate in the school of education and social work at the university of sussex said our research ha highlighted the need for the space to produce knowledge differently what we call transformation we need to listen to how teacher and student want to create space that are better suited to the rapidly changing context of the twentyfirst century this demand that we respond in way not known or even imagined before whilst not forgetting what we already know',\n","

uncovered a progression gap between choice made by child on free school meal and their more affluent peer which can not be explained by their result at school or where they live it found that just per cent of child eligible for free school meal attend higher education compared to per cent of child from more privileged background poorer child are also twice a likely to drop out of education at and are more than half a le likely to study alevels that could get them into a top university the research carried out for the commission by education datalab investigates the post choice of child by social and geographical background gender and ethnicity the study explores all educational choice by all student who took gcse in the summer of by linking three national database for the first time by taking into account factor such a where a child life and their attainment at school the research provides a unique analysis of how educational choice made at the age of can have a deep impact on a child future career and earnings the report find that gcse attainment and geographical access to post course explains some of the gap in choice made by child from different background but it also uncovers significant difference between poorer child and wealthier child living in the same neighbourhood with the same gcse result overall the research find that around a quarter of the progression gap the different choice made by child after leaving school is purely down to social background previous research ha suggested that child from poorer background are le likely to have access to the

school and better destination data to hold school to account for the guidance they give young people the report concluded that britain ha a deep social mobility problem which is getting worse for an entire generation of young people it found that for every young person who get into university from a treadmill or just managing family background seven do not this new research also reveals stark geographical inequality in the choice of institution available to young people it find that there are area of the country with little or no school sixth form provision within a commutable distance in these area there are significantly lower percentage of pupil studying academic qualification at attending a top university or studying for a science or math degree compared to similar area it also identifies the north east and the south west a having the fewest institution for young people to choose from which may be a significant factor in why post and destination outcome are so poor in these

with the same school result are progressing le than their betteroff classmate that is not about lack of ability it is about lack of opportunity the progression gap ha many cause but it suggests something is going badly wrong in our education system the lack of proper career advice in school and the sheer complexity of the post education and training system make it particularly difficult for

reviewed and improved and various subject are often updated and implemented into school up and down the country we have a national curriculum to ensure each student receives a particular level of education by outlining structure within each subject on what child should be taught in order to keep up with some of the best education system from around the world the national curriculum change every now and again to ensure future student receive the best possible education there ha been a new approach to the national curriculum over recent year it now set out the core knowledge that pupil should learn but doesnt necessarily specify any approach in how teacher should teach this appears to have now been left up to the discretion of each school that follows the national curriculum for over year the national curriculum ha been revised and over the next couple of year there are a number of change to be put in place including some change that have already happened subject area geography there have been a number of difference in the way geography is now to be approached in the national curriculum it wa decided that there would be a renewed emphasis on both locational and place knowledge a well a the human and physical process alongside this some technical procedure should be covered such a using grid reference there should also be a renewed commitment towards the concept of fieldwork and the use of map a well a written communication key stage geography the national curriculum includes certain topic that should be included but not necessarily how they should be taught for example the focus at key stage should be developing knowledge about the world the united kingdom and their locality pupil at this stage should be taught certain fact such a the world seven continent and their location and naming and identifying the four country and capital city of the uk trip to london may include extra curricular education that can aid pupil understanding of the united kingdom in term of human and physical geography pupil should be able to identify seasonal weather pattern and identify hot and cold area of the world pupil at key stage should also be able to use world map and globe to identify the uk and other country or ocean studied at this stage key stage geography a they progress pupil should be expected to extend their knowledge to include europe north and south america a well a significant human and physical feature pupil should be able to identify the position of latitude longitude equator and other large feature of the world such a the tropic of cancer and capricorn pupil at key stage should now be taught more physical geography including the climate zone biome and feature such a volcano and earthquake trip to destination such a iceland could encourage further learning about some of the world physical geography there is a huge emphasis on geographical skill at this stage pupil should be able to use the eight point of a compass four and sixfigure grid reference and key on ordnance survey map in order to build on their knowledge key stage geography knowledge at this stage should include africa russia asia and the middle east with a focus on their environmental region such a desert a well a major city visiting place such a morocco is the perfect place for curious geographer with the sahara desert on your doorstep physical geography should concentrate on geological timescales and plate tectonics and the change in climate over the year from the ice age to the present day there should also been some emphasis on how human activity relies on effective natural system and how human and physical process interact to influence and change landscape and environment pupil at key stage should be able to collect and analyse geographical data and build further on their knowledge of globe and map of course one of the best way to enrich the national curriculum especially with geography is to visit such major city and key physical characteristic taking an educational trip to further pupil understanding of the world they live in would provide a unique experience to enhance their learning using a company that organises such trip like adaptable travel could provide a once in a lifetime opportunity for many student up and down the country',\n"," 'altro safety flooring and hygienic wall cladding are providing the
