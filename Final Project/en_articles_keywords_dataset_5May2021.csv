Whizz Education quantifies maths lockdown learning loss – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Maths', 'News', 'Partner content']",3 days ago,https://www.education-today.co.uk/whizz-education-quantifies-maths-lockdown-learning-loss/,"Whizz Education, provider of the leading virtual tutor Maths-Whizz, has quantified the lockdown learning loss in maths experienced by 5–13-year-olds in the UK. Whizz Education’s research shows that 46% of the 1,721 children assessed experienced a learning loss, exhibiting an average of knowledge decline of eight months during the first lockdown.
Dr Junaid Mubeen, Director of Education explains: “Learning loss is such a loaded term. At Whizz we simply take it to mean a decline in students’ knowledge levels, which is hardly surprising in the face of severe disruptions this past year. Despite the tireless efforts of teachers to adapt lessons and provide remote classes, the global pandemic has had a drastic effect on pupils’ learning. “We found that pencil and paper multiplication was the skill that fared worst, along with pencil and paper addition, both demonstrating more than six months of knowledge declines across the sample.
“Knowledge declines were less severe in topics such as integers, powers and roots and also decimals (5 months’ learning loss). Children studying these topics are generally older, however, so these findings reflect similar studies we have conducted in other regions around the world, where younger pupils with a limited store of knowledge to draw on, suffered a higher degree of learning loss.
“It is also likely that those in our underserved communities have been hardest hit – a sad consequence of the pandemic is that it has exacerbated the attainment gap, with disadvantaged students falling further behind due to lack of access to online learning during school closures. We’ve observed this in both the UK and globally.
“While we recognise that some students have lost almost a year’s worth of maths knowledge, when addressing how best to move forwards it is important that teachers are not put under further pressure, or that students are made to feel penalised, for events which have, frankly, been out of their control. We should not expect quick fixes; it will take months, even years, for students to regain any lost ground. The emphasis needs to be on informal assessment of gaps and ensuring each student receives individualised support that addresses their specific knowledge gaps. Virtual tutors can play an important part in the battle against learning loss, without inducing further burdens on teachers.
“At Whizz Education, we believe that every child deserves a learning experience that caters to their individual needs and pace of learning. We work closely in partnership with schools to develop quality bespoke learning programmes delivered via our virtual tutoring platform, Maths-Whizz. Maths-Whizz uses powerful AI to build a completely personalised plan for each child, and then continues to tailor it as they complete lessons.
“Maths-Whizz provides more than 1,250 pre-prepared lesson plans, assisting teachers to deliver measurable learning gains for children with a range of abilities. Our research shows with just 60 minutes per week of Maths-Whizz over a six-week summer period, students can expect to acquire a 4-month learning advantage. This year of all years, this seems like too great an opportunity to pass up.”

Virtual Schools Archery League supports Covid-safe interschool sports – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'Sport & Play', 'Wellbeing']",3 days ago,https://www.education-today.co.uk/virtual-schools-archery-league-supports-covid-safe-interschool-sports/,"A brand-new Virtual Schools Archery League, launching this June, is helping schools engage in Covid-safe interschool sports, while also encouraging students to enjoy the benefits of competitive archery.
Led by The School Archery League (SAL) and supported by Archery GB, the accessible competition helps set a new challenge for pupils that supports mental focus, promotes fun and provides the benefits of physical activity – all in a socially distant way. The Virtual Schools Archery League is open to all schools across the country, with separate divisions for barebow and recurve bows as well as abilities. Shooting can take place indoors or outdoors to suit the school’s facilities.
Over the past year, various lockdowns and periods of home-schooling have meant physical activity has been restricted for many pupils, with a negative impact on both physical and mental wellbeing. As a naturally socially-distanced activity, archery is the perfect sport to get pupils moving and motivated again.
Schools joining the Virtual Schools Archery League are invited to submit one or more groups for entry, who will then compete against other schools within the same category. Teachers record and submit each archer’s top scoring shooting round virtually during the competition period, and a winner is announced every half term.
Sarah Gibbs, SAL Coordinator says: “We want to get as many pupils as possible across the country involved in the League and having a go at archery. It’s a great sport that everyone can enjoy – and with in-person inter-school competitions currently limited, the Schools Archery League is a great way for students to enjoy an inclusive, competitive sport, in a safe and socially-distanced way.
“We think students will really enjoy the thrill when they hit the target and can see their aim improve over time. Of course, a bit of friendly competition between schools makes for added excitement too!”
Neil Armitage, CEO of Archery GB said, “The Virtual Schools Archery League is a fantastic initiative and one that we hope really encourages more students to get involved in the sport. Archery is well-recognised as an inclusive sport that is accessible to all ages and abilities, so it also helps engage those that are perhaps not naturally drawn to sports. Covid-19 has had a significant impact on physical activity across the board, and archery is an ideal sport for post-Covid times to help boost mental and physical wellbeing.”
Accessible across the spectrum regardless of age, physical ability or gender, archery is a uniquely inclusive sport. As one of very few that sees disabled and non-disabled participants and those of all ages compete against each other on level terms, archery truly breaks down barriers and creates an accessible path to sporting fun for all levels of abilities and fitness.
With physical benefits such as improved stamina and upper body strength, mental benefits of improved control, enhanced focus and boosted self-confidence, students also benefit from the social and competitive aspects of competing alongside their teammates.
This summer, Archery GB will once again be leading The Big Weekend event (9 – 11 July), which this year will be preceded by The Big Week (5 – 9 July), encouraging even more people to have a go at the inclusive sport. With a whole host of activities, including taster sessions, social events, fun games and archery challenges there will be plenty of opportunities to try the inclusive sport at clubs, venues, centres and schools nationwide – perfect for the 77% of British adults who wish they’d been able to try archery during school PE.

Students across the UK learn how to negotiate life’s toughest challenges using peer created resources – Education Today,"['Diversity', 'Further Education', 'Health, Hygiene & Safety', 'Inclusion', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Resources', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources', 'University', 'Wellbeing']",1 week ago,https://www.education-today.co.uk/students-across-the-uk-learn-how-to-negotiate-lifes-toughest-challenges-using-peer-created-resources/,"Tens of thousands of students age 14-19 across the UK are set to benefit from a raft of new free, peer created digital resources to help them negotiate a wide range of complex life and world issues.
The innovative Role Models programme and set of resources sees students studying at universities across Sussex, tackling the life issues they with they’d known more about when they were younger to provide practical help to younger students. The programme is one of a wide range of innovative programmes funded by the Office for Students through the Sussex Learning Network, which supports over 10,000 young people a year to make informed education and life choices.
The digital Role Model series already features booklets and videos on issues such as ‘Worry’, ‘Gender & Sexuality’ and ‘The Climate Emergency’ and will this week be joined by two new resources tackling ‘Body Positivity’ and ‘Fake News’.
The new online resources are free to use and available to all and can be found at
https://www.sussexlearningnetwork.org.uk/lisetoolkits/Role-Models-Resource-Books
Each themed booklet contains hints, tips and advice, personal accounts from the Role Models as well as interactive exercises and links to relevant news articles, recommended social media accounts and helplines. Dedicated Teacher Resource packs are also available that provide themed, timed out lesson plans for each topic.
Imogen, Role Model and Acting for Film Student, University of Chichester, commented: “I really enjoy the creativity of thinking through the best way to approach a challenging issue to make it accessible. I almost speak to my younger self and think ‘right Imogen, what should I tell you?’.  Feeling that the advice I’m giving might help even one young person makes everything I do 100% worthwhile and makes me really proud.”
The new Role Models Body Positivity booklet and video – created by young people including Imogen with the supervision of educators – tackles everything from the drive for perfection in the age of social media to gender identity and body dysphoria; while the Fake News resources explore the growing prevalence of false information, the impact of sharing it, why it’s damaging and how to spot it.
Debra Vice-Holt, Programme Manager at SLN said: ‘Role Models is the ultimate win-win education programme. It helps younger students explore important life issues that they might find difficult to discuss with older adults, and equips Role Models with communication, presentation and writing skills that increase their confidence and employability.’

Dagenham school wins gold mental health award – Education Today,"['Awards', 'Community engagement', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Parental engagement', 'Wellbeing']",2 weeks ago,https://www.education-today.co.uk/dagenham-school-wins-gold-mental-health-award/,"All Saints School in Dagenham has landed a gold standard award for its outstanding mental health and wellbeing provision.
The school has been awarded the School Mental Health Award by the Carnegie Centre of Excellence for Mental Health in Schools after being found to be excelling in all eight areas of the award framework.
Headteacher Clare Cantle said: “This award recognises that we, as a staff body and school community, care for one another: we express this care in so many ways, and it is humbling to know that it is being celebrated so positively.
“During months of lockdowns, our staff maintained their relationships with our families both in school for key workers and online.
“I especially consider the weekly newsletter with its holistic content to have been a personal and purposeful way to promote the bonds we have all nurtured over the years and to educate our young people no matter the obstacles.
“What we have learnt from this troubling period is that All Saints staff are there for all, all the time”.
The school was particularly praised for its work to support parents and pupils during lockdowns, with resources and workshops to help parents support their child’s mental health and additional sessions for parents to speak to teachers if they needed to.
All staff at the school are trained in mental health to offer pupils the best possible first-line support, and there is plenty in place to support their wellbeing too.
The school fully supports flexible working and striking a work-life balance. Staff have a strong sense of community and get involved in various social events and physical activities to support their mental health.
Councillor Evelyn Carpenter, Cabinet Member for School Improvement and Educational Attainment, said: “This is great news and a tribute to the creativity, care, skill and dedication of the excellent staff at All Saints School.
“Despite the difficulties posed by the pandemic, All Saints Catholic School has continued to improve the health and wellbeing of its staff and pupils.”",all saint school in dagenham ha landed a gold standard award for it outstanding mental health and wellbeing provision the school ha been awarded the school mental health award by the carnegie centre of excellence for mental health in school after being found to be excelling in all eight area of the award framework headteacher clare cantle said this award recognises that we a a staff body and school community care for one another we express this care in so many way and it is humbling to know that it is being celebrated so positively during month of lockdown our staff maintained their relationship with our family both in school for key worker and online i especially consider the weekly newsletter with it holistic content to have been a personal and purposeful way to promote the bond we have all nurtured over the year and to educate our young people no matter the obstacle what we have learnt from this troubling period is that all saint staff are there for all all the time the school wa particularly praised for it work to support parent and pupil during lockdown with resource and workshop to help parent support their child mental health and additional session for parent to speak to teacher if they needed to all staff at the school are trained in mental health to offer pupil the best possible firstline support and there is plenty in place to support their wellbeing too the school fully support flexible working and striking a worklife balance staff have a strong sense of community and get involved in various social event and physical activity to support their mental health councillor evelyn carpenter cabinet member for school improvement and educational attainment said this is great news and a tribute to the creativity care skill and dedication of the excellent staff at all saint school despite the difficulty posed by the pandemic all saint catholic school ha continued to improve the health and wellbeing of it staff and pupil,"['evelyn', 'parent', 'carnegie', 'celebrated', 'catholic', 'wellbeing', 'worklife', 'teacher', 'excelling', 'headteacher']"
STEM sessions open up new world for Fylde Coast’s future scientists – Education Today,"['Careers', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Science', 'Secondary schools', 'STEM']",2 weeks ago,https://www.education-today.co.uk/stem-sessions-open-up-new-world-for-fylde-coasts-future-scientists/,"A careers project has enabled Fylde Coast students to explore the world of science, as part of a wider programme to help young people explore the benefits of further and higher education.
Year nine and 10 students from Montgomery High School, South Shore Academy, Cardinal Allen and Fleetwood High have been participating in the Science Capital project, which was created to stimulate interest in STEM subjects and make students aware of the related career paths and opportunities available.
Students have been benefitting from a range of industry insights, from group coaching sessions with Lancaster University Physics PhD students and demonstrations including exciting pyrotechnics displays at Blackpool Sixth Form, to career assemblies and virtual tours of the LUniverse planetarium at Lancaster University. Delayed due to the pandemic, sessions were recorded and made available to be delivered in class or at home, to also help encourage parents to broaden their interest in science.
The project was led by Mhairi Mitchinson, Assistant Head of the Department of Science at the Blackpool Sixth Form College, in partnership with Lancaster University Physics Department and Future U.
Mhairi, a former engineer, established the Fylde Coast Ogden Trust Partnership in 2012, with Blackpool Sixth Form as the hub school. The Ogden Trust is a charitable trust which was created to promote the teaching and learning of physics.
She said: “I have always been passionate about opening doors to all young students to study STEM subjects and overcoming barriers that might stop a student from achieving. The project built on the work we have been doing over the past decade in the Blackpool area and has been received very well. It is such a pleasure to work with such dedicated teachers, students and staff to help inspire our next generation.”
Jessica Richmond, Senior Coordinator, at Future U, added: “As the Science Capital project was initially delayed due to the pandemic, it’s fantastic to see how effectively the delivery has been adapted to ensure students aren’t missing out on these vital engagement opportunities, while prioritising safety.
“It’s important to make careers outreach interesting for not only pupils, but parents and guardians too, as their support is so important when it comes to young people exploring what may be possible in their futures beyond school. There are so many educational and career pathways relating to science, and we’ve been thrilled with the feedback from students who have now been exposed to potential careers they may never have considered previously.”
Dr Andy Blake, Lecturer in Physics and the Physics Outreach Coordinator at Lancaster University, said: “It is a pleasure to work on this exciting schools engagement project in partnership with Blackpool Sixth Form College and Future U. It has never been more important to support the learning and career aspirations of young people in Blackpool and the Fylde Coast. By providing pupils with opportunities to interact with our staff and students in online lessons and assemblies, we aim to show them that science is open to everyone.”
Future U is part of the national Uni Connect Programme, funded by the Office for Students, and continues to support school pupils across Lancashire to encourage more young people to think about higher education and future careers.
It involves institutions and organisations across the county including the University of Central Lancashire, Lancaster University, Edge Hill University and the University of Cumbria.
Lancashire’s Future U works with a network of schools, in addition to colleges, higher education providers and local agencies to create tailored activities to meet the needs of students for now and the future.
Future U’s list of partners includes: Blackburn College, Blackpool Sixth Form College, Blackpool and the Fylde College, Burnley College, Edge Hill University, Inspira, Kendal College, Lancaster University, Myerscough College, Nelson and Colne College, Preston’s College, STEMFirst, Runshaw College, The Lancashire Colleges, University of Central Lancashire, University of Cumbria and West Lancashire College.

Students from across the UK invited to share their views on Parliament restoration – Education Today,"['Buildings & Maintenance', 'Charity', 'Community engagement', 'CPD', 'Design & Build', 'Educational event', 'History', 'News']",3 weeks ago,https://www.education-today.co.uk/students-from-across-the-uk-invited-to-share-their-views-on-parliament-restoration/,"The Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Programme has partnered with educational charity, Smart School Councils, on a programme of activities to hear the views of children and young people about the historic restoration of the Palace of Westminster.
Children and young people will be able to take part in the debates in school through the Smart School Councils’ Big Debate Club, a model which provides teachers with a range of free classroom and online activities.
The debates will engage students of all ages and abilities with questions and topics about the different elements of the restoration and renewal programme, enabling children to learn more about the Palace of Westminster and express their opinions and perspectives on the importance of the project.
Sarah Johnson, CEO, Houses of Parliament Restoration and Renewal Sponsor Body said: “As we get on with the job of developing the plan to restore the iconic Houses of Parliament, it is important to remember that children and young people are the future custodians of this historic building. I am delighted that we are working with the Smart School Councils charity to hear the views of young people about the restoration and renewal of the Houses of Parliament.”
Schools will be able to upload their responses on a range of aspects of the restoration to the Big Debate Club website and these views will be used to inform the detailed and costed restoration plan which is being developed by the Restoration and Renewal Programme.
A further two Big Debate Club questions exploring the restoration of Parliament in relation to sustainability and accessibility will take place in June 2021. There will be a future series of activities later in 2021.
Schools that sign up to the Big Debate Club will also be provided free continued professional development (CPD) webinars giving an additional layer of support to help teachers to facilitate meaningful classroom discussions on the topic of Restoration and Renewal.

Liverpool school selected for Ofsted pilot – Education Today,"['News', 'OFSTED', 'SEND']",3 weeks ago,https://www.education-today.co.uk/liverpool-school-selected-for-ofsted-pilot/,"A specialist school in Woolton has taken part in a pilot for Ofsted which helps inspectors learn about the new inspection framework that will be used from September 2021. 
Abbot’s Lea School saw this as an exceptional opportunity to help Ofsted shape its inspection of special schools and also to use it to learn about the process ahead of its own planned inspection which is now overdue, and expected to take place any time, and no later than next school year.
The experience was helpful and positive, and resulted in a number of findings, all of which support the school’s self-evaluation.
Four Ofsted Her Majesty’s Inspectors (HMIs), including senior HMIs, praised the school for its clearly presented and well-triangulated strengths. 
The school leaders received helpful feedback about the suggested focus for the next steps in the school’s development journey towards becoming an international centre of Autism education, research and professional development, and all of the pointers will feed into the School Development Plan 2021-24 which the school is currently consulting on with the students, staff and the families.
Ofsted benefited too; the experience of practising the new inspection approaches in a special school setting proved particularly helpful for the team and many of the suggestions made by the Abbot’s Lea School leaders will contribute to the revising of the protocols for the actual visits.
Headteacher, Mrs Ania Hildrey said: “As a school leader, I want what is best for my students. This is neither governed, directed or limited by Ofsted inspection framework, handbook or the actual inspection visit process. Ofsted is therefore neither a matrix of what we must do as a school, nor the main indicator of whether we are superb at what we help our students achieve. Ofsted can, however, be a very helpful additional moderator of a school’s effectiveness and so, with that in mind, I always welcome another view and perspective.
“Our engagement in the pilot provided a brilliant opportunity to pause – after a very turbulent time of the pandemic operation – and invite an external view of whether the ambition we have for our students, and the ways in which we support them, is solid.
Mrs Hildrey added: “I am delighted with the appraisal received and it re-affirmed our own evidence that the school is outstanding, particularly in the most complex area of positive behaviour support, personal development and raising aspirations for adulthood and independence.
“As ever, the more you look, the more you find and it was equally helpful to have four pairs of “fresh” eyes, with no prior knowledge of our school, give us feedback on what we could do better. We are actively working through all of the pointers and will include them in our work this term and in the coming year.”
Mrs Hildrey concluded: “As a school we are also committed to improving practice beyond our own walls and so, I am personally very pleased to have been given an opportunity to shape Ofsted’s approach to inspecting special schools and I trust that my feedback will enhance the experience for other schools – and for us, too, as we are in the “inspection window” any time soon!”",a specialist school in woolton ha taken part in a pilot for ofsted which help inspector learn about the new inspection framework that will be used from september abbot lea school saw this a an exceptional opportunity to help ofsted shape it inspection of special school and also to use it to learn about the process ahead of it own planned inspection which is now overdue and expected to take place any time and no later than next school year the experience wa helpful and positive and resulted in a number of finding all of which support the school selfevaluation four ofsted her majesty inspector hmis including senior hmis praised the school for it clearly presented and welltriangulated strength the school leader received helpful feedback about the suggested focus for the next step in the school development journey towards becoming an international centre of autism education research and professional development and all of the pointer will feed into the school development plan which the school is currently consulting on with the student staff and the family ofsted benefited too the experience of practising the new inspection approach in a special school setting proved particularly helpful for the team and many of the suggestion made by the abbot lea school leader will contribute to the revising of the protocol for the actual visit headteacher mr ania hildrey said a a school leader i want what is best for my student this is neither governed directed or limited by ofsted inspection framework handbook or the actual inspection visit process ofsted is therefore neither a matrix of what we must do a a school nor the main indicator of whether we are superb at what we help our student achieve ofsted can however be a very helpful additional moderator of a school effectiveness and so with that in mind i always welcome another view and perspective our engagement in the pilot provided a brilliant opportunity to pause after a very turbulent time of the pandemic operation and invite an external view of whether the ambition we have for our student and the way in which we support them is solid mr hildrey added i am delighted with the appraisal received and it reaffirmed our own evidence that the school is outstanding particularly in the most complex area of positive behaviour support personal development and raising aspiration for adulthood and independence a ever the more you look the more you find and it wa equally helpful to have four pair of fresh eye with no prior knowledge of our school give u feedback on what we could do better we are actively working through all of the pointer and will include them in our work this term and in the coming year mr hildrey concluded a a school we are also committed to improving practice beyond our own wall and so i am personally very pleased to have been given an opportunity to shape ofsteds approach to inspecting special school and i trust that my feedback will enhance the experience for other school and for u too a we are in the inspection window any time soon,"['abbot', 'improving', 'professional', 'practising', 'selfevaluation', 'revising', 'reaffirmed', 'ofsted', 'education', 'headteacher']"
The Schools & Academies Show and EdTech Update take place online! – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News']",3 weeks ago,https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-schools-academies-show-and-edtech-update-take-place-online/,"The Schools & Academies Show and EdTech Update took place last week, as fully interactive virtual experiences from 27th – 30th April 2021.
Both shows were co-located online to allow the 3,700+ education leaders from Schools, Colleges and Universities in attendance to seamlessly visit both events.
The virtual event format allowed attendees to peruse an online exhibition, tune-in to live panels discussions, take part in live roundtables, workshops and networking sessions, whilst also having access to over 50 hours of CPD-certified best-practice case studies and presentations.
The Schools & Academies Show kicked off with a highly topical presentation from Mufti Hamid Patel, CEO of Star Academies, who provided practical leadership lessons from his experience building Star Academies into one of the country’s foremost academy trusts.
EdTech Update started with an exciting keynote address from our Platinum Sponsor; Computacenter, with Adam Levy, Head of Digital Solutions at Computacenter and Jermaine Sutton, Education Executive at Microsoft discussing ‘Remote not Removed: The New Era of Digital Education’.
After Gavin Williamson’s announcement during the week of the show regarding the government’s vision for every school to become part of a family of schools in a strong multi-academy trust, we also hosted a timely session after this announcement from Baroness Berridge, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the School System.
Baroness Berridge’s presentation entitled ‘Coming Out of Covid-19 and the Future of Academy Trusts’ stated:
“This is not about ideology and structural change in and of itself. Our ambition is for more schools to benefit from being part of a strong family because Multi-Academy Trusts and their schools exist to advance education for the public benefit.”
After another hugely successful virtual show, providing school and education leaders with a platform to listen, learn and network with peers, the next exciting venture will be the return of physical shows, with the Schools & Academies Show Birmingham and EdTech Summit 2021 taking place on 17th & 18th November at the NEC.
Chris Callaghan, Event Director, Schools & Academies Show and EdTech Summit stated;
“The virtual format and event platform has provided us with an invaluable tool to ensure we continue to reach school leaders and support our community within the sector. The success of the virtual shows has enabled us to reach a wider regional audience and also given us food for thought for how we combine the benefits of the virtual format with the traditional face-to-face event.
A big thank you to all of our visitors and sponsors who made the shows possible and we hope to see everyone again in November to celebrate a return to some kind of normality.”

New free online course launched to support people working with children and young people with mental health needs – Education Today,"['Mental health', 'News', 'Social issues', 'Support materials', 'Wellbeing']",4 weeks ago,https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-free-online-course-launched-to-support-people-working-with-children-and-young-people-with-mental-health-needs/,"The Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) has developed a new, free online course for people working with children and young people who have social, emotional and mental health needs. It is the only training course that explores the links between these issues that is available for free in the UK.
Across 15 modules, the ‘Mind your words’ training course aims to increase understanding of the links between mental health and communication, and how communication barriers can be identified and removed to help children and young people achieve their full potential. Each module takes about 15 minutes to complete and can be done in stages, so can easily fit around the trainee’s schedule.
Mental health problems affect around one in 10 children and young people and they are at additional risk of having speech, language and communication needs, as there are links between these issues:

81% of children with formally identified emotional and behavioural disorders had significantly below average language abilities;
45% of young people referred to mental health services had higher order language impairment (difficulties with understanding inference and abstract language) compared to 15% of young people in a comparison group;
Children with a mental health disorder report having speech or language problems five times more than those without;
Communication difficulties are a risk factor for developing mental health problems: adolescents with developmental language disorder (DLD) are more likely to have symptoms of depression and anxiety than their peers.

RCSLT chief executive Kamini Gadhok MBE says: “The ‘Mind your Words’ eLearning provides an accessible and easy way for those working with children and young people to recognise how mental health needs often go hand in hand with communication difficulties.
“By undertaking the training those working with children and young people will gain a greater understanding of this area and be better equipped to support them. This has become increasingly important during the pandemic, which has had a significant impact on children’s mental health. So we should all be looking at ways we can better support children to develop the communication skills that enable them to express themselves, form positive relationships and build their resilience.”

Dunblane student selected for engineering excellence scholarship – Education Today,"['Awards', 'Computing', 'Digital skills', 'Engineering', 'Grants', 'News', 'STEM']","May 6, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/dunblane-student-selected-for-engineering-excellence-scholarship/,"Dunblane High School student Jessica Francis has been selected for the prestigious national Arkwright Engineering Scholarship due to her outstanding abilities in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
With a love of coding, sixteen-year old Jessica started to teach herself to code when she was just seven using the Scratch educational tool for coding before moving on to the high-level and general-purpose programming language Python. During lockdown, Jessica created a Monopoly predictor program, which predicts which housing properties a player is going to land on; basically playing the game itself. She then created a website for her mother’s business Kirkmillan Consulting.
In addition to Jessica’s love of computer science, the engineering scholarship incorporates wider aspects of STEM skill development including coding.
Jessica said, “the Arkwright Scholarship offers me so many opportunities to develop my skills, including Connect Days where I can meet industry professionals, especially women, to ask questions and explore my potential future career opportunities. It’s fun and I’m positioning myself well to secure the ideal job in the future. My particular scholarship is sponsored by cyber security company CrowdStrike who will provide me with a mentor. I have to fit these experiences into my normal school week but it’s definitely helping me to develop a special insight into the industry.
“I’m not interested in developing games; I want to create things that are useful. My first Arkwright virtual event involved developing a cat feeder app; I always forget to feed mine!”
“CrowdStrike is proud to support Jessica as she continues to build her computer science, engineering and coding skills with the help of her mentor from our Engineering & Technology team,” said Colin Black, CrowdStrike Chief Operating Officer and Executive Sponsor of the company’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion initiatives. “As the world’s leading cloud-native cybersecurity company, we are committed to making investments in students around the world, particularly those who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, to improve their access and opportunity to high-quality, high-value learning and development opportunities. Congratulations to Jessica and all Arkwright Engineering Scholarship winners. We look forward to welcoming you to the workforce in the years to come and are excited to see the impact you will have in our industry and beyond.”
Arkwright Engineering Scholarships is the most esteemed scholarship programme of its type in the UK, with over 6,000 Scholarships awarded to date. Run by educational charity, The Smallpeice Trust, the programme is designed to inspire and develop the next generation of future leaders as they continue their journey into the exciting world of engineering. The Scholarships are awarded to hard-working 16 year-olds through a rigorous selection process, providing them with financial support, industry experience and real-world learning opportunities, supporting them through their A levels, Scottish Highers or equivalent qualifications.",dunblane high school student jessica francis ha been selected for the prestigious national arkwright engineering scholarship due to her outstanding ability in stem science technology engineering and mathematics with a love of coding sixteenyear old jessica started to teach herself to code when she wa just seven using the scratch educational tool for coding before moving on to the highlevel and generalpurpose programming language python during lockdown jessica created a monopoly predictor program which predicts which housing property a player is going to land on basically playing the game itself she then created a website for her mother business kirkmillan consulting in addition to jessicas love of computer science the engineering scholarship incorporates wider aspect of stem skill development including coding jessica said the arkwright scholarship offer me so many opportunity to develop my skill including connect day where i can meet industry professional especially woman to ask question and explore my potential future career opportunity it fun and im positioning myself well to secure the ideal job in the future my particular scholarship is sponsored by cyber security company crowdstrike who will provide me with a mentor i have to fit these experience into my normal school week but it definitely helping me to develop a special insight into the industry im not interested in developing game i want to create thing that are useful my first arkwright virtual event involved developing a cat feeder app i always forget to feed mine crowdstrike is proud to support jessica a she continues to build her computer science engineering and coding skill with the help of her mentor from our engineering technology team said colin black crowdstrike chief operating officer and executive sponsor of the company diversity equity inclusion initiative a the world leading cloudnative cybersecurity company we are committed to making investment in student around the world particularly those who are traditionally underrepresented in stem field to improve their access and opportunity to highquality highvalue learning and development opportunity congratulation to jessica and all arkwright engineering scholarship winner we look forward to welcoming you to the workforce in the year to come and are excited to see the impact you will have in our industry and beyond arkwright engineering scholarship is the most esteemed scholarship programme of it type in the uk with over scholarship awarded to date run by educational charity the smallpeice trust the programme is designed to inspire and develop the next generation of future leader a they continue their journey into the exciting world of engineering the scholarship are awarded to hardworking yearolds through a rigorous selection process providing them with financial support industry experience and realworld learning opportunity supporting them through their a level scottish highers or equivalent qualification,"['sixteenyear', 'website', 'cat', 'mother', 'science', 'arkwright', 'cybersecurity', 'cyber', 'python', 'mathematics']"

Rugby club launches football and women’s rugby college courses for teens – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'FE colleges', 'News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'Sport & Play']","May 4, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/rugby-club-launches-football-and-womens-rugby-college-courses-for-teens/,"To go alongside its already popular men’s rugby college course, Birmingham Moseley Rugby Club’s academy has introduced football and women’s rugby courses for local teens aged 16+.
With these courses, students will have two training sessions and one class a day for 3 days a week, and will achieve a NCFE qualification, the same as they’d receive at a typical college of further education. During the courses however, they will also have the benefit of competitive games on a Wednesday.
Both courses at Birmingham Moseley Rugby Club will begin in September 2021 and are open for enrolment now. To apply, click here: https://www.wearescl.co.uk/birmingham-rugby
Travis McIntyre, who runs the academy, said: “We’re so excited to announce that we’ll be running two brand new courses from September, it’s something that we’ve been wanting to expand into for a while now and because of the popularity of football and women’s rugby around Birmingham, we’re sure we’ll have some incredible players join us.
“We started the academy in 2014, exclusively running men’s rugby courses, but it’s been so successful that we’re sure we have the expertise and knowledge to replicate this into a football course and, adapt the knowledge we already have for the women’s rugby classes.
“Our past rugby students have gone on to gain full scholarships at universities and play in the Birmingham Moseley Rugby Club’s team, so while we are primarily a rugby club, we appreciate all sport and are excited to expand our student base to football, as well as rugby.”

School assembly for millions of children inspires pupils to take part in Captain Tom 100 challenge – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Educational event', 'Fund raising', 'News', 'Teaching resources']","April 19, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/school-assembly-for-millions-of-children-inspires-pupils-to-take-part-in-captain-tom-100-challenge/,"Millions of UK children will be invited to tune in to one big school assembly as they are encouraged to take on a special 100 challenge as part of a brand-new fundraising initiative.
The Captain Tom 100 is being organised by The Captain Tom Foundation with London Marathon Events to celebrate Captain Tom’s life, his generosity of spirit the hope and the joy he brought to millions and his sense of fun.
The morning announcements and school notices will be replaced for one day only with a YouTube broadcast with Hannah Ingram-Moore, daughter of Captain Sir Tom, and featuring a special message from PE star Joe Wicks which will be played simultaneously in classrooms across the country and around the world on 30th April – which would have been Captain Tom’s 101st birthday.
To join in, children will be asked to take part in a challenge of their choice centred around the number 100.
Hannah Ingram-Moore, youngest daughter of the Second World War veteran who raised more than £39million for the NHS by walking 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday, said: “To inspire, excite and engage with young people, we have a fabulous film featuring famous faces and unsung heroes showing us what they will be doing for their Captain Tom 100 challenge. From David Beckham to five-year-old Betty Leigh Allinson, there’s inspiration for every age and every ability.
“We love the idea of millions of children watching the same thing at the same time and then running, hopping, skipping, dancing, baking, sewing, writing, drawing or whatever else they might want to do to raise money.
“Children are a primary focus of this campaign which celebrates inclusivity and diversity and allows absolutely everyone to do their little bit in my father’s memory. Let’s continue what my father started. It’s continuing where he left off.”
The assembly will be just one part of a school-centred focus, appealing to secondary and primary schools to get stuck into the fundraising mission.
Those taking part will be asked to take on their 100 challenge between Friday, April 30, and the Bank Holiday Monday on May 3 but Ms Ingram-Moore said she suspected many schools would choose to engage in a communal activity on the Friday – which would have been Captain Sir Tom’s birthday.
Hannah added: “We are picturing, with sheer delight, children on playing fields up and down the country doing 100 star jumps, 100 hula hoops or skipping 100 times. We believe schools will really want to engage with this event because my father had such a tremendous impact on young people during the height of the pandemic. He simply loved children and showed them that anything was possible.”
Schools will be invited to stream the special assembly to pupils on the morning of Friday 30th April but can access the material anytime from the 26th April.
On top of this, education packs are available for participating schools to download from the Captain Tom 100 website from 12th April. These will include a host of resources to suit different age groups, including from the National Literacy Trust and White Rose Maths.
Jonathan Douglas, chief executive of the National Literacy Trust, said: “We are very proud to be supporting the Captain Tom 100. The fantastic thing about this initiative is you can choose your own challenge and we’re so excited to see how schools and children interpret the theme.
“Captain Sir Tom Moore achieved great things and inspired hope during a really difficult time, encouraging everyone to look positively to the future.
“In our own research, one in two children said that reading encourages them to dream about the future. That’s why we’ve come up with lots of fun literacy ideas around the number 100 that pupils can do as part of their learning in the classroom or at home to be part of this brilliant campaign bringing the nation together on Captain Tom’s birthday.”
Caroline Hamilton, director of White Rose Maths, said the organisation is proud to support the Captain Tom 100 initiative.
She added: “Along with millions of others across the country, the White Rose Maths team was truly inspired by this extraordinary gentleman’s effort and commitment, and we’re excited to be playing our part in celebrating his many achievements.
“What better way for us to do this than to take a close look at the number 100! It’s a genuinely fascinating number, and we’re looking forward to sharing lots of ways in which children, teachers, parents and carers can explore it in much more detail.”
Children who take part can also download a certificate of achievement.
The event is being supported by London Marathon Events, the Mass Participation Sports Organisers (MSO), Prominent PR, adam&eveDDB, LiveWire Sport and Studio Republic.

UK Festival of Robotics 2021: KS1 & 2 robot drawing and story competitions now open for entry – Education Today,"['Art & Craft', 'Competition', 'Educational event', 'KS1', 'KS2', 'Literacy', 'News', 'Primary schools']","April 15, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/uk-festival-of-robotics-2021-ks1-2-robot-drawing-and-story-competitions-now-open-for-entry/,"The organisers of the annual UK Robotics Week celebration – now the UK Festival of Robotics – have announced the return of their robot drawing and story competitions, inviting primary schoolchildren nationwide to share their robot-inspired creativity with a team of top judges. The inaugural competitions in 2020 attracted an impressive number of entries from primary school-age children up and down the country, and this year’s competitions promise to be even bigger and better following the re-opening of UK schools last month.
For the “Draw A Robot” competition, children in Key Stage 1 (aged 5 – 7 years old) have the chance to draw a robot that they’d like to see in the future. The robot could be designed to accomplish any task or job – the sky’s the limit! The children will be able to submit a robot drawing, up to 200-word description, and five key features (labelled on the drawing). The “Once Upon A Robot” writing competition is open to all Key Stage 2 children (aged 7-11 years old), and challenges competition participants to write an 800-word story featuring any kind of robot their imagination can conjure. The story could take place on Earth, in space or even on another planet!
The two competitions will be judged by robotics experts from the organising ESPRC UK-RAS Network, plus two very special invited judges. The writing competition will be judged this year by writer, comedian, podcaster and history presenter Iszi Lawrence, author of The Unstoppable Letty Pegg. The drawing competition will be judged by Fiona MacDonald, Head of Learning at the Design Museum in London.
There are fabulous prizes on offer, including a MakeBlock Codey Rocky Robot (courtesy of FAIR-SPACE), a Thames Komos Coding & Robotics Kit (provided by RAIN), plus some unique and exclusive prizes courtesy of our guest judges. For more information, details of prizes, judging criteria and to submit an entry, please visit https://www.ukras.org/school-robot-competition/.
Both competitions are open for entry now and will close on 23rd May 2021. The winners will be announced during the online UK Festival of Robotics (19th – 25th June 2021) at a virtual award ceremony.
EPSRC UK-RAS Network Chair Robert Richardson comments: “We are delighted to be able once again to host these two exciting challenges for the nation’s schoolchildren. The fantastic creativity and ingenuity demonstrated by our competition entrants has become a real highlight of our annual robotics celebrations. We are looking forward immensely to reviewing this year’s entries, and providing a platform to showcase the creative achievements of pupils and their schools.”

The National Literacy Trust and Penguin Random House launch a review into national primary school library provision – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Literacy', 'News', 'Primary schools']","April 13, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-national-literacy-trust-and-penguin-random-house-launch-a-review-into-national-primary-school-library-provision/,"The National Literacy Trust, supported by Penguin Random House UK, has launched a nationwide review of primary school library provision, including a call to evidence to gather perspectives from key stakeholders who work in education as well as directly from families. The project will look at how COVID-19 has impacted primary school libraries and imagines the future of library provision in the primary sector.
Primary school libraries are a critical part of the school learning environment, providing not only access to a diverse range of books and resources but also to a quiet and safe place to read. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, school libraries were under pressure, with 1 in 10 primary and secondary schools in the UK not having a library at all.
Library provision also varies significantly across the country, with schools in more disadvantaged communities less likely to have good library provision. Schools with a higher proportion of children eligible for free school meals are more than twice as likely not to have a designated library space onsite.
Nearly 2 in 3 (63%) of UK primary and secondary students use their school library – and children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely than their better-off peers to use the service. COVID-19 and the necessary closure of schools and libraries is likely to have a detrimental impact on pupils that rely on these spaces and resources.
This review follows the expansion of Puffin World of Stories, an award-winning collaboration between Penguin Random House UK and the National Literacy Trust which has reached 225 schools over the last three years with nearly 80,000 books donated. The programme aims to offer practical solutions to some of the challenges facing reading for pleasure in schools where budget constraints often mean investing in school libraries is not an option. Schools receive bespoke training, hundreds of free books and colourful resources to help bring their reading spaces to life. Author and actor Nathan Bryon was announced as the first Puffin World of Stories ambassador last month.
Jonathan Douglas CBE, CEO of the National Literacy Trust said: “We are proud to be launching this important piece of work and are looking forward to seeing the submissions. This is an opportunity for the sector and families to come together to review what a good primary school library provision would look like and what steps are needed to get there.
“Primary school libraries are a key element in the academic recovery of children following the three national lockdowns. There is no greater time to be collating evidence of their fundamental importance as we try and support the youngest generation’s learning and literacy.”
Francesca Dow, Managing Director of ‎Penguin Random House Children’s said: “Every child should have the opportunity to discover the magic of reading in school, and yet we know that library provision in primary schools is patchy – despite so many teachers and librarians’ best efforts. By funding this vital review of the role of primary school libraries, we hope to show how important libraries and reading for pleasure will be to our post-COVID national recovery.”
The call for evidence is targeted at librarians, teachers, schools, organisations and charities within the education space and organisations working with libraries and will be open until June 25th.

"Thousands of schoolchildren are walking for road safety this June, with Brake’s Kids Walk 2021 – Education Today","['Charity', 'Community engagement', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Road safety']","April 9, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/thousands-of-schoolchildren-are-walking-for-road-safety-this-june-with-brakes-kids-walk-2021/,"Road safety charity Brake has announced the return of its road safety campaign Brake’s Kids Walk. On Wednesday 16 June 2021, thousands of schoolchildren across the UK will take part in a short, supervised walk to promote important road safety messages. Children will walk in pairs in crocodile formation within their community, to emphasise the importance of being able to walk without fear or threat from traffic or pollution.
Children of all ages are at risk of being hurt or killed when walking near roads. On average, six children are killed or seriously injured on roads in Britain every day – that’s equivalent to a whole classroom of children every week.
By signing up to Brake’s Kids Walk, schools and educators can access a FREE action pack featuring lesson plans, assemblies, activities, and posters, all brightly illustrated and featuring the popular Shaun the Sheep characters by Aardman. As well as teaching children vital road safety skills, Brake’s Kids Walk raises awareness among parents and other adults of the need to protect children on our roads. Posters and demonstration materials highlight what children need to be able to walk safely in their communities: they need footpaths, cycle paths, safe places to cross, and slow and clean traffic.
Brake, the road safety charity, has been running walking events for schoolchildren at a national level for more than 15 years. The charity is also behind Road Safety Week – the UK’s biggest road safety campaign each November.
All schools and education communities are invited to sign up to Brake’s Kids Walk 2021 at www.brake.org.uk/kidswalk.
Brake’s Kids Walk 2021 is sponsored by esure.
Scott Williams, head of programme delivery at Brake, said: “It’s every child’s right to be able to walk in their community without fear of traffic and pollution. Throughout the pandemic families have taken to the streets on foot and by bike and we hope these activities will continue as restrictions lift and ordinary road traffic returns. It is vital that children are able to walk safely in the places where they live. This year we hope to inspire as many children, schools and families as possible through our Brake’s Kids Walk event.”
David McMillan, CEO at esure Group added: “We are thrilled to have partnered with Brake to sponsor this year’s event as we believe in the importance of road safety for children everywhere. We want to be a force for good and make a real difference by focusing on better and safer driving. Brake’s Kids Walk is an important opportunity to raise awareness about road safety messages.”",road safety charity brake ha announced the return of it road safety campaign brake kid walk on wednesday june thousand of schoolchildren across the uk will take part in a short supervised walk to promote important road safety message child will walk in pair in crocodile formation within their community to emphasise the importance of being able to walk without fear or threat from traffic or pollution child of all age are at risk of being hurt or killed when walking near road on average six child are killed or seriously injured on road in britain every day thats equivalent to a whole classroom of child every week by signing up to brake kid walk school and educator can access a free action pack featuring lesson plan assembly activity and poster all brightly illustrated and featuring the popular shaun the sheep character by aardman a well a teaching child vital road safety skill brake kid walk raise awareness among parent and other adult of the need to protect child on our road poster and demonstration material highlight what child need to be able to walk safely in their community they need footpath cycle path safe place to cross and slow and clean traffic brake the road safety charity ha been running walking event for schoolchildren at a national level for more than year the charity is also behind road safety week the uk biggest road safety campaign each november all school and education community are invited to sign up to brake kid walk at brake kid walk is sponsored by esure scott williams head of programme delivery at brake said it every child right to be able to walk in their community without fear of traffic and pollution throughout the pandemic family have taken to the street on foot and by bike and we hope these activity will continue a restriction lift and ordinary road traffic return it is vital that child are able to walk safely in the place where they live this year we hope to inspire a many child school and family a possible through our brake kid walk event david mcmillan ceo at esure group added we are thrilled to have partnered with brake to sponsor this year event a we believe in the importance of road safety for child everywhere we want to be a force for good and make a real difference by focusing on better and safer driving brake kid walk is an important opportunity to raise awareness about road safety message,"['parent', 'footpath', 'november', 'traffic', 'ceo', 'crocodile', 'charity', 'wednesday', 'schoolchildren', 'june']"
"Popular national food, farming and environment competition announced in new and exciting format – Education Today","['Catering & Nutrition', 'Competition', 'Educational event', 'England', 'Environmental Focus', 'News', 'Secondary schools', 'Wales']","April 7, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/popular-national-food-farming-and-environment-competition-announced-in-new-and-exciting-format/,"LEAF Education, in partnership with Coleg Cambria Llysfasi, has re-launched its annual national competition in Food, Farming and Environment to offer even more schools the chance to win on-farm experiences. For the first time, the competition will see up to ten schools being chosen as semi-finalists, who will each receive an on-farm visit. Finalist schools will then be selected to win an activity-filled weekend at Coleg Cambria Llysfasi, North Wales in October. The competition, which is supported by Waitrose, looks to engage young people with farming, food production and the natural environment, and is open to all secondary schools (years 9 – 11) across England and Wales. Teachers enter by explaining why their students and school deserve a place in the competition and the benefits it will bring to their school. To enter, please complete this form by the 16th April.
LEAF Education Director, Carl Edwards, explained: “There has never been a more critical time to harness the strength of feelings our young people have for the future of their planet. This competition addresses issues they care most about – climate change, sustainability, environmental protection, health and nutrition and climate change. By providing young people with first-hand experience of farming, food production and opportunities for more in-depth, critical analysis around current farming issues, our aim is to raise their awareness of the importance of farming in their everyday lives and its role in addressing the climate and ecosystem emergency.”
The farm visits for competition semi-finalists, which take place with LEAF’s team of Regional Education Consultants, will see students being asked to answer a farming related hypothesis using their experience on the farm, combined with wider research, and present their response. The recorded presentations will then be judged, and finalists will be invited to bring up to three students and two teachers to a weekend at Coleg Cambria Llysfasi in beautiful North Wales in the Vale of Clwyd – an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. At the end of the weekend, one school will be crowned the ‘Innovation School of the Year 2021 in Food, Farming and Environment’. The finalists’ weekend will take place from the 22 – 24 October 2021.
The finalists’ weekend will be made up of fun and educational activities based around the college farm. The college farm is 970 acres and is a mixed enterprise commercial farm, which includes a dairy herd, sheep, beef, crops and forestry. The college also has an Animal Management Centre and an industry leading Agricultural Engineering workshop and latest tractor and machinery technologies. Throughout the weekend, students will milk cows, handle sheep, drive a tractor and gain an insight into the role of drone technology in food production.  Students will also visit the agri-forest, see countryside management in practice, and experience the driverless technology used by the agricultural industry.
Launched in 2019, out of the 33 students who have taken part in the competition, 12 have gone on to apply to study at land-based colleges. All students reported that it had ‘positively changed their perception of the farming industry’ and that it had ‘helped them with their studies back at school’.
Elin Roberts, Assistant Principal of Technical Studies and site lead at Llysfasi, said: “We are proud to once again be working in partnership with LEAF Education for the third annual Innovation School of the Year for Food, Farming and Environment competition. It provides a fantastic opportunity for students to gain first-hand experience of farming, whilst also highlighting how vital it is as part of the climate crisis solution.”
Entries close on 16 April 2021. The semi-finalist schools will be announced and contacted by 30 April.

Spire Healthcare starts search for up to 270 nurse degree apprentices – Education Today,"['Apprenticeships', 'Careers', 'Higher education', 'News', 'Qualifications', 'University']","April 6, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/spire-healthcare-starts-search-for-up-to-270-nurse-degree-apprentices/,"The leading private healthcare provider, Spire Healthcare, is launching a new nurse degree apprenticeship programme in partnership with the University of Sunderland, with roles available across Spire’s 35 English hospitals.
Student nurses return to studies at Sunderland University’s Helen McArdle House Picture: DAVID WOOD
The nurse degree apprenticeship is open to applicants at all stages of life, including school leavers, university graduates and people looking to retrain. The nurse degree apprenticeship is a work-based qualification providing apprentices with a combination of training and assessments via distancing learning and on-site placements applying practical knowledge. Placements will be delivered at a Spire hospital as well as at the local NHS trust and GP practice.
Apprentices enjoy a flexible, work-based approach, combining university study and workplace learning to develop new knowledge, skills and thinking whilst completing a degree. The benefit of the degree apprenticeship route is the ability to earn while learning, with a salary of between £18,000 and £21,000 depending on previous experience.
Each nurse degree apprenticeship will complete the programme with a BSc degree. Applications are open now, with successful applicants starting the programme in July 2021.
Deborah Barker, Group Talent Manager at Spire Healthcare, commented, “We are thrilled to be launching our new nurse degree apprenticeship programme. Delivered in partnership with the University of Sunderland it offers hundreds of people, from school leavers, university graduates or people looking to retrain, the opportunity to earn while they learn. Nurses have a vital role in delivering care and support to patients while in hospital and this programme helps to introduce more people into the profession.
“The appeal of an apprenticeship has risen in recent years due to the increasing cost of the traditional university degree route. Covid-19 has then compounded this with classroom-based teaching disrupted over the course of 2020/21.
“The programme has been developed to give people broad experience of healthcare in England, they will complete placements in Spire hospitals, NHS hospitals, and in the community. This ensures that every apprentice gets a full-rounded experience of the role and is well-prepared for their future career in the sector.”
Simone Bedford, Team Leader Professional Healthcare Practice and Midwifery at University of Sunderland, said: “We are excited to be working with Spire Healthcare as this is a great opportunity to work with partners in the private sector.
“The Registered Nurse Degree Apprenticeship will be delivered nationally within the Spire Healthcare group and will offer greater flexibility than a traditional degree to the 270 new nursing apprentices. Based on the University of Sunderland’s successful experience elsewhere, this ‘grow your own’ model is a very exciting development for everyone concerned and we commend Spire Healthcare for its initiative in embarking on such a programme.”
Spire’s nurse degree apprenticeship programme is open to applicants from people 18 years and over. Unusually for a nurse apprenticeship programme, it is open to people coming straight out of education, with no existing healthcare background. Applicants need to hold a maths and English GCSE A to C / 9 to 4 or equivalent and have either a level 3 in Healthcare or 112 UCAS points. The length of the programme is four or five years, depending on existing qualifications. This is reduced to two to three years for Nurse Associates or Assistant Practitioners to reflect existing experience and prior learning.

Birth to 5 Matters guidance is launched – Education Today,"['Early years', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Pedagogy']","March 31, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/birth-to-5-matters-guidance-is-launched/,"Following six months of consultation and input from across the early years sector, the Early Years Coalition tonight launches Birth to 5 Matters.  The materials include a core document available as a free download, with printed copies available to purchase, and an interactive online version which includes all the text from the core document, plus additional resources, suggestions for further reading, and a bibliography.
“We are delighted to offer this support to the early years sector as they look ahead to implementing the revised EYFS from September,” said Beatrice Merrick, Chair of the Early Years Coalition. “It is a rich resource which will support knowledge of child development and how children learn, and help practitioners make their own professional judgements about meeting the needs of the children they work with.”
Although Birth to 5 Matters builds on previous non-statutory guidance for the EYFS, it has updated all the material to reflect research evidence and meet the needs of practitioners today.  It outlines the foundations of good practice and offers information and guidance for practitioners to consider how the Principles of the EYFS can be brought to life in their setting. New sections on play, characteristics of effective learning, and self-regulation are designed to help practitioners to reflect on and develop their own pedagogy.
“The guidance includes detailed examples of trajectories of development and learning in all the prime and specific areas,” says Nancy Stewart, Project Lead.  “The need for this information to support child development knowledge came through very clearly in our consultations.”
But she cautions that a new mindset is needed across the sector, to move away from a checklist approach that takes practitioners away from being with children. “If settings have been using previous guidance as a checklist, they should not see Birth to 5 Matters as a replacement to be used in that way,” she says.  “Instead, it is a support for informed professional judgement that will help practitioners move to a new way of understanding and supporting children’s learning, with a minimalist approach to recording assessment.’
The Early Years Coalition is currently planning for training materials and events to introduce practitioners to using Birth to 5 Matters, as well as to support professional development in areas that have been highlighted through the consultations.

Reopening safely: how CO2 monitoring can improve ventilation and lower infection risk – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Design & Build', 'News', 'Safety & Security']","March 31, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/reopening-safely-how-co2-monitoring-can-improve-ventilation-and-lower-infection-risk/,"Assessing the efficacy of ventilation with CO2 monitors has been identified as a key strategy for enabling a safe and COVID-Secure return to work and school.
For workplaces and schools, a safe reopening during the ongoing pandemic can only be achieved with a robust risk-reduction strategy that covers all transmission routes. Since one of the primary ways that COVID-19 is spread is through the air by aerosols – airborne liquid particles that may carry infection – keeping these particles out of the nearby air by regularly introducing clean and fresh air into communal spaces (i.e. ventilating) is vital for preventing the spread of disease.
So how do you ventilate spaces effectively? And how do you know if ventilation practices are even working?
The UK Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), along with The Chartered Institute of Building Service Engineers (CIBSE) (UK) and the Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations (REHVA) (Europe), have issued guidelines on how to improve ventilation in rooms. Their advice includes opening windows, ensuring regular breaks for occupants and increasing mechanical ventilation.
All three reports also highlight CO2 monitoring as a key tool for any effective ventilation strategy, both to help improve ventilation and to help assess its efficacy.
Why is CO2 monitoring important?
Feeling that a room has become ‘stuffy’ or feeling drowsy after hours sat in a meeting room are sensations that are familiar to many-and they’re caused by a build-up of CO2.
Just like CO2, aerosols carrying infectious diseases that are exhaled by occupants will linger in the air without sufficient ventilation. The longer that a room is occupied, the greater the volume of infectious aerosols that will build up, and the greater the risk of infection.
It is possible to evaluate the level of ventilation available in a room just by assessing how occupants are feeling. For example, if a person perceives that a room feels ‘stuffy’, they may proceed to open a window to increase air flow rates. However, this method is ultimately reliant on guesswork, and occupants may not be able to detect simply by feeling alone when extra ventilation is needed until it is too late.
Monitoring CO2 levels eliminates guesswork from ventilation assessment and enables a systematic approach to increasing ventilation. By accurately measuring the volume of CO2 in the air, CO2 monitors provide hard evidence of when extra ventilation is needed – which might be a long time before occupants feel that the room could do with some fresh air.
The report from SAGE identifies that CO2 monitoring is particularly important in workplaces and schools, where it is most likely to be an effective indicator of ventilation rates.
In spaces that are used for extended durations by groups, i.e. offices and classrooms, CO2 measurements reflect the air quality with a greater accuracy and give a good indication of ventilation conditions.
By contrast, CO2 monitoring is not as effective at indicating ventilation rates in large volume or low occupancy spaces, where airflow and dispersion of occupants may vary. In these areas, however, SAGE still recommends aiming to keep CO2 levels low (below 800ppm) as a good rule of thumb.
How to improve ventilation with CO2 monitoring
After establishing what ventilation is available in a room, CO2 monitors should be used for two purposes:

to alert when extra ventilation is needed
to evaluate the efficacy of ventilation

CO2 monitors should be placed on an inside wall, with sensors facing away from windows or grilles so that the readings are as accurate to the inside conditions as possible. It is also recommended that they are placed in visible positions c. 1.5m off of the ground so that responsible persons can easily act upon their alerts.

Alarms show when extra ventilation is needed
Alarms on CO2 monitors can alert occupants of the immediate need to increase ventilation in a room by signalling that the CO2 concentration has exceeded acceptable levels.
As a visual indicator, CO2 alarms also help to boost awareness of the importance of ventilation. The CIBSE report suggests that involving school pupils in responding to CO2 alerts can help to increase ventilation efficacy by improving awareness.
The reports suggest that alarms should be set to alert when the CO2 concentration measures at or above 1000ppm. If or when an alarm is triggered, action should be taken to immediately increase air flow into the occupied space. Opening high windows is an effective strategy, especially in colder months, as it will sufficiently increase ventilation rates while not significantly lowering room temperature or causing a draught.
For schools with mechanical ventilation systems, the reports recommended maximising fresh air flow at all times.

Take informed action with long-term recorded data
With data loggers, CO2 levels can be recorded over time so that data can be viewed and analysed, and further action taken based on this evidence.
Data from CO2 monitoring should be used to assess whether ventilation measures are taking effect.
Time-stamped data from one room might show that instances of increasing natural ventilation-for example, by opening windows or doors-is effective at lowering CO2 levels. For a different room, with different dimensions and different available ventilation routes, analysis of data may reveal that there is a need to implement more significant measures to fully protect the health of occupants. Rooms which are shown to regularly record above 1500ppm should be identified and prioritised for improvements to ventilation.
A further advantage of monitoring with a CO2 data logger is that long-term recorded data can provide evidence of the need for significant or structural changes to be made, helping to support funding applications.

The Tinytag CO2 data logger
Robust, easy-to-use and quick to deploy, the Tinytag CO2 data logger is a simple and effective solution for indoor air quality monitoring.
Using a self-calibrating non-dispersive infrared sensor (NDIR), the data logger accurately measures and records carbon dioxide concentrations with outstanding long-term stability. The TGE-0010 model measures from 0 to 2000ppm and is ideal for measuring indoor air quality in busy classrooms or offices. A model measuring up to 5000ppm is also available for more specialised applications.
The data logger has an LED on its front which will flash red when an alarm has been triggered, enabling responsive action to high CO2 levels. The data logger can be wall-mounted or placed on surfaces to continuously monitor CO2 concentrations wherever is required. Compact and light-weight, the logger can be situated anywhere where there is a mains supply, and can easily be transferred between different locations for versatile monitoring throughout a building.
Data is offloaded and viewed in user-friendly Tinytag Explorer software, where it can then be exported to third-party programmes in a variety of popular file formats (.xls, .xml, .csv, .txt) for further analysis and presentation.
Gemini Data Loggers also offers a certificated calibration service that is traceable to National Standards. CO2 data loggers can be calibrated prior to shipment, or returned to Gemini at any time for calibration.

While low levels of CO2 are a good indication of effective ventilation, they are not confirmation of low aerosol transmission by themselves. Other transmission factors, including occupant density, occupant duration and the type of activity being performed in a room should also be taken into account when assessing transmission rates. A good COVID-19 risk management strategy should also comprise mitigation efforts for other transmission routes, for example, mask-wearing, social distancing and reducing occupancy time in rooms.",assessing the efficacy of ventilation with co monitor ha been identified a a key strategy for enabling a safe and covidsecure return to work and school for workplace and school a safe

Wellspring Academy Trust held its annual Festival of Learning virtually, showcasing the future of trust-wide interaction and shared learning. Whilst the shift was necessary due to Covid restrictions, the process has revealed how effective, engaging CPD can be delivered on a large, geographically diverse, trust-wide basis.
Natalie Hardman, chief administration officer, at Wellspring explains: “Our Festival of Learning is a highlight of our year, and a fantastic opportunity for our community of 25 schools to get together, be inspired and share their knowledge. There was no way we could let Covid stop that!
“Moving online proved hugely successful. We had 1,696 people all online together to watch the live stream of our keynote speaker and attendees booked 5,182 sessions in total. As well as colleagues from across the trust, we also welcomed colleagues from a further fifteen non-Wellspring schools.
“Sharing best practice across a trust that is spread across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and eight local authority areas can be a huge logistical challenge, but our virtual Festival of Learning has demonstrated quite convincingly how technology can overcome that challenge. One of the clear benefits of being part of a large trust is the vast amount of experience contained within it. By developing online opportunities for collaboration, we can really make the most of that.
“We are now exploring more options for online learning, including broadcasting of expert knowledge sessions for educational professionals across Wellspring and beyond. Professional generosity is an important part of our charitable purpose and we are committed to sharing our knowledge and expertise to benefit all. The opportunity for increased online sharing and CPD within MATs and the education sector as a whole is a really exciting prospect.”
Wellspring’s Festival of Learning was held on 12 February and attendees benefited from workshops on a huge variety of subjects ranging from behaviour management approaches to how to best use the Google Education platform. A keynote speech was delivered to all by Jaz Ampaw-Farr before attendees than joined their chosen four sessions throughout the course of the day.
Wellspring currently manages 25 schools, with that figure set to grow significantly over the next few years. It operates in mainstream primary and secondary, as well as having extensive experience in delivering special and alternative provision.

Case study: How Oxford Business College reached out during lockdown – Education Today,['News'],"March 17, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/case-study-how-oxford-business-college-reached-out-during-lockdown/,"How Oxford Business College reached out during lockdown
The global pandemic has had a profound impact on the education sector. Lecturers, students and staff have all been deeply affected by lockdowns and social distancing rules. But one college prioritised reaching out during 2020. This is their story.
In March 2020, like many educational institutions, Oxford Business College suspended face to face classes, and students were swiftly introduced to online tuition. Although originally expected to last only a few weeks, the College’s remote learning platforms have been developed to provide students with as much support as they’ve needed throughout the pandemic.
By seeing online learning as an opportunity, not just a stop gap, the College has been able to accept new enrolments throughout the pandemic. Given many of the College’s students are from international backgrounds, they’ve seen an impressive uptake in spite of global travel restrictions.
Online learning has also been welcomed by the College’s mature students. Leaders of the College conducted research on how mature students responded to the technology, and found that the majority were excited by the flexibility of remote learning. The College hope that this key finding will improve long term access to higher education for adult learners.
During the pandemic, Oxford Business College also invested in its content outreach in order to stay connected with students and staff via social media.
Alongside regular posts with insights and advice from the world of business, the College collaborated with companies across Oxfordshire on a series of video interviews. These interviews helped to promote local companies during a difficult time, while also providing valuable information for students on management and business development during challenging economic conditions.
Content has also addressed key social subjects, including diversity and inclusion, charity, sustainability and mental health. The College’s proactive approach to marketing saw it rank first on Edurank’s college social media tracker for 5 consecutive months, between July and November 2020.
Mental health has been a priority for the College throughout the pandemic. As an ongoing part of its outreach programme, the College has been focused on supporting students. For example, the College recently hosted a virtual weekend of events which included comedy, music and cooking – bringing students together at a time when the academic community was working and studying apart.
The College’s growth has been demonstrated through a significant rise in student numbers, and seen the opening of a second campus – a space in London to complement the institution’s main campus in Oxford.
It’s been a year of development and expansion for Oxford Business College. Rather than seeing the pandemic as a roadblock, the College chose to take action to support existing students and reach out to prospective new ones.
The College’s experiences are a reminder of the important words once spoken by Sir Winston Churchill, that, “A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty”.
Despite challenging conditions, Oxford Business College was optimistic throughout 2020, and is benefiting from new opportunities in 2021.",how oxford business college reached out during lockdown the global pandemic ha had a profound impact on the education sector lecturer student and staff have all been deeply affected by lockdown and social distancing rule but one college prioritised reaching out during this is their story in march like many educational institution oxford business college suspended face to face class and student were swiftly introduced to online tuition although originally expected to last only a few week the college remote learning platform have been developed to provide student with a much support a theyve needed throughout the pandemic by seeing online learning a an opportunity not just a stop gap the college ha been able to accept new enrolment throughout the pandemic given many of the college student are from international background theyve seen an impressive uptake in spite of global travel restriction online learning ha also been welcomed by the college mature student leader of the college conducted research on how mature student responded to the technology and found that the majority were excited by the flexibility of remote learning the college hope that this key finding will improve long term access to higher education for adult learner during the pandemic oxford business college also invested in it content outreach in order to stay connected with student and staff via social medium alongside regular post with insight and advice from the world of business the college collaborated with company across oxfordshire on a series of video interview these interview helped to promote local company during a difficult time while also providing valuable information for student on management and business development during challenging economic condition content ha also addressed key social subject including diversity and inclusion charity sustainability and mental health the college proactive approach to marketing saw it rank first on eduranks college social medium tracker for consecutive month between july and november mental health ha been a priority for the college throughout the pandemic a an ongoing part of it outreach programme the college ha been focused on supporting student for example the college recently hosted a virtual weekend of event which included comedy music and cooking bringing student together at a time when the academic community wa working and studying apart the college growth ha been demonstrated through a significant rise in student number and seen the opening of a second campus a space in london to complement the institution main campus in oxford it been a year of development and expansion for oxford business college rather than seeing the pandemic a a roadblock the college chose to take action to support existing student and reach out to prospective new one the college experience are a reminder of the important word once spoken by sir winston churchill that a pessimist see the difficulty in every opportunity an optimist see the opportunity in every difficulty despite challenging condition oxford business college wa optimistic throughout and is benefiting from new opportunity in,"['lecturer', 'student', 'july', 'class', 'roadblock', 'oxford', 'academic', 'weekend', 'online', 'pandemic']"
"Pearson reinvigorates English Language GCSE through contemporary, skills-based learning – Education Today","['English', 'Exams', 'GCSEs', 'KS4', 'News', 'Secondary schools']","March 16, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/pearson-reinvigorates-english-language-gcse-through-contemporary-skills-based-learning/,"Pearson has announced the launch of a new Pearson Edexcel GCSE (9-1) English Language specification, which has been designed to engage and motivate students through contemporary texts and writing tasks, providing a new qualification choice to reflect the diversity of learners.
The newly accredited Pearson Edexcel GCSE (9-1) English Language 2.0 qualification, which will be available for teaching at the start of the 2021-2022 academic year, provides students with a strong foundation for further academic or vocational pathways through real-world, applicable content.
Based on feedback from teachers, the new, one-year specification supports students following a less traditionally literary pathway through their English studies or educators looking for a fresh, new English Language course to motivate those required to re-sit.
With an innovative approach to the 19th century text requirement that sees 19th-century, non-fiction newspaper articles and instructional pieces of writing used rather than 19th century fiction, the qualification uses texts with relatable, modern themes and focuses on real-world applicable writing tasks such as letters of application.
Speaking about the new qualification, Katy Lewis, Head of English and Drama (pictured), said: “Every year 750,000 people take their English GCSE. In consulting with the English teaching community last year, we recognised that a one-size fits all approach to English Language doesn’t equally suit the needs, interests and progression of all learners.
“We wanted to develop a qualification that was equal but different to the English Language GCSEs that are currently available to learners across the UK, whilst motivating and engaging students to equip themselves with life-long skills.”
Requiring no co-teaching of literature, the functional qualification is designed to reinvigorate English language learning and pave the way for exam success whilst exposing learners to a broad range of diverse and inclusive texts.
As part of the organisation’s work with the Lit in Colour programme, Penguin Random House UK will also be providing schools and settings taking the new specification with access to a bespoke anthology of texts by contemporary writers and writers of colour.
The specification has been described as a “positive move” by teachers involved in its development, which allows students to truly engage and showcase their knowledge, providing them with “a better chance of success because the qualification meets their needs.”
Ruth Rhoden-Farmer, GCSE and FS English Lecturer at Newcastle and Stafford Colleges Group, said: “The new GCSE format and resources will give each student the opportunity to explore visually engaging texts, engage with the English Language heritage, and apply the techniques they have discovered in their own writing.”
Pearson will be providing schools and settings with specification and sample assessment materials, mapping documents, schemes of work and one-year planners, a comprehensive programme of online training and network events and one-to-one support from an English specialist to support them in delivering the qualification with confidence.

Hawking Foundation launches free vaccination learning tools – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'Coronavirus', 'Health, Hygiene & Safety', 'News', 'Parental engagement', 'Resources', 'Social issues', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources', 'Wellbeing']","March 15, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/hawking-foundation-launches-free-vaccination-learning-tools/,"The Stephen Hawking Foundation has launched a schools programme to enable children and their families to make informed decisions about vaccinations after routine childhood immunisations fell every year for almost a decade.
The first in a series of teaching aids published today focusses on the COVID vaccine and tackles head on conspiracy theories that have led to limited uptake in some communities. Immunisation coverage for all routine childhood vaccinations has declined in England by 0.2-1% between 2017-18 and 2018-19
Teachers and researchers say this is in part caused by confusing information and unfounded conspiracy theories about vaccines.
The Stephen Hawking Foundation has joined forces with a school in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country and leading research institutions, Queen Mary University of London and the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene (LSHTM), to devise simple and accurate materials aimed at enabling young people to better understand and question the role of vaccinations.
The programme is the brainchild of Ed Stubbs, a secondary school teacher at Morpeth School in Tower Hamlets, East London, who became concerned at a growing sense of fear in the classroom about vaccinations and the prevalence of ill-informed conspiracy theories.
Mr Stubbs said: “As a teacher previously working in inner-city Liverpool, and now in London, I have noticed students becoming increasingly fearful of vaccination. Some of my students and their families refuse their school vaccinations. I hear incorrect, and ‘conspiracy’ information shared in my classroom. I fear that students’ real and fictional concerns increase UK vaccine hesitancy.
“The charged and often accusatory debate about vaccination choices can make young people feel hesitant about voicing their concerns and seeking help in debunking false information. They fear critical judgement over their doubts.  I decided to create a set of unbiased resources for use in schools.”
The partnership with the Stephen Hawking Foundation and LSHTM’s Vaccine Confidence Project has produced learning materials which can be downloaded for free from their and the Queen Mary University of London websites.
The resources support the Stephen Hawking Foundation’s goal to encourage science education.  It also builds on Professor Hawking’s family links with the research centre as Professor Hawking’s father was a researcher at LSHTM.
Lucy Hawking, Chair of the Stephen Hawking Foundation’s Trustees, said: “We are so pleased by this collaboration, which aims to help young people gain a better understanding of immunisation programmes. We are dedicated to encouraging young people to engage with science. This important project aims to encourage school children to think about vaccine research and the progress in this field which is key to saving lives.”
Professor Heidi Larson, Director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, said: “I feel teachers are ideally placed to combat the UK’s falling vaccination rates. This programme has been carefully calibrated to include the insights of some of the leading scientists in this field but to make the information accessible to people of all ages and communities.”
An immunologist from Queen Mary University of London, doctors, primary school specialists, teachers and students from Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds and a prominent member of the Somali community have also fed in to the teaching materials.
The resources are designed to promote critical thinking, ask big questions and provide reliable, well sourced information to help school age students investigate complex issues regarding science and society within a classroom setting. The vaccine project is the first of a projected series of such initiatives.

Work to commence on new Discovery Academy in Sheffield – Education Today,"['Academies', 'Buildings & Maintenance', 'Construction', 'Design & Build', 'England', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Secondary schools', 'SEND']","March 4, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/work-to-commence-on-new-discovery-academy-in-sheffield/,"Work is set to begin on the new Discovery Academy in Sheffield, designed by HLM Architects working with construction specialists Tilbury Douglas Construction.
The free special academy will cater for 80 special education needs (SEN) pupils and is being delivered via the Department for Education Framework on behalf of Sheffield City Council.
The site is located in the south east of the city centre, on the grounds of a former special school. The new two-storey facility will be a simple linear block, comprising primary and office accommodation on the ground floor, with secondary provision and further office accommodation at first floor. The hall and dining accommodation, which includes a ‘quiet’ dining area, will be shared by all years and is located close to associated service space and external breakout and sitting areas.
Primary classrooms will be located on the ground floor to enable direct access to the dedicated outside social space. Internally, the primary school is separated from the secondary school through the use of a secure, pass door adjacent to the main entrance. At the heart of the school sits the library, hall and dining where primary, secondary and entrance routes converge.
During the design process, HLM Architects engaged with the school, academy sponsors, planning authority and local community through a series of structured workshops and held a public exhibition to integrate feedback before the submission of planning.
The design of the school is based on sustainability principles. This has included optimising daylight and natural ventilation within teaching spaces to promote a passive, sustainable approach. The site is being developed to enhance its ecological value, retaining mature landscape features, and incorporating sustainable drainage measures such as porous macadam and rainwater attenuation. Wherever possible sustainable or recycled materials have been specified without affecting the schemes durability, such as recycled plastic benches. The school is expected to open in February 2022.
John Gittins, Divisional Director at Tilbury Douglas Construction, said: “We are delighted to be working with HLM Architects to deliver the new Discovery Academy project for the Department for Education. Tilbury Douglas’ appointment to this project is real testament to the expertise within our team and our excellent track record in delivering some of the best education facilities in the UK.”
Nexus MAT Chief Executive Warren Carratt said: “We are beyond excited to be working with the DfE, Sheffield council, HLM and Tilbury Douglas to build or new special academy. We are passionate about bring greater choice and quality of offer to families in Sheffield, and Discovery Academy will make a huge difference to the local SEND landscape. We have been actively engaged with the design process throughout, and the school has been planned with needs of our specific learners in mind”.
AJ Taylor, Associate at HLM Architects, said: “The design of this school has been driven by the creation of a high-quality, personalised provision for pupils with autism-spectrum conditions with related social, emotional and mental health needs, as well as a range of other learning difficulties which will result in a safe and nurturing learning environment.”",work is set to begin on the new discovery academy in sheffield designed by hlm architect working with construction specialist tilbury douglas construction the free special academy will cater for special education need sen pupil and is being delivered via the department for education framework on behalf of sheffield city council the site is located in the south east of the city centre on the ground of a former special school the new twostorey facility will be a simple linear block comprising primary and office accommodation on the ground floor with secondary provision and further office accommodation at first floor the hall and dining accommodation which includes a quiet dining area will be shared by all year and is located close to associated service space and external breakout and sitting area primary classroom will be located on the ground floor to enable direct access to the dedicated outside social space internally the primary school is separated from the secondary school through the use of a secure pas door adjacent to the main entrance at the heart of the school sits the library hall and dining where primary secondary and entrance route converge during the design process hlm architect engaged with the school academy sponsor planning authority and local community through a series of structured workshop and held a public exhibition to integrate feedback before the submission of planning the design of the school is based on sustainability principle this ha included optimising daylight and natural ventilation within teaching space to promote a passive sustainable approach the site is being developed to enhance it ecological value retaining mature landscape feature and incorporating sustainable drainage measure such a porous macadam and rainwater attenuation wherever possible sustainable or recycled material have been specified without affecting the scheme durability such a recycled plastic bench the school is expected to open in february john gittins divisional director at tilbury douglas construction said we are delighted to be working with hlm architect to deliver the new discovery academy project for the department for education tilbury douglas appointment to this project is real testament to the expertise within our team and our excellent track record in delivering some of the best education facility in the uk nexus mat chief executive warren carratt said we are beyond excited to be working with the dfe sheffield council hlm and tilbury douglas to build or new special academy we are passionate about bring greater choice and quality of offer to family in sheffield and discovery academy will make a huge difference to the local send landscape we have been actively engaged with the design process throughout and the school ha been planned with need of our specific learner in mind aj taylor associate at hlm architect said the design of this school ha been driven by the creation of a highquality personalised provision for pupil with autismspectrum condition with related social emotional and mental health need a well a a range of other learning difficulty which will result in a safe and nurturing learning environment,"['academy', 'tilbury', 'education', 'teaching', 'february', 'architect', 'library', 'autismspectrum', 'classroom', 'sheffield']"

Pupils taking part in the Premier League Primary Stars education programme, delivered by professional football club community organisations across England and Wales, will each receive a free copy of Football School: 20 Fantastic Football Stories by authors Alex Bellos and Ben Lyttleton.
National Literacy Trust research has found that children who own their own books are nearly three times more likely to enjoy reading. The partnership will help support children whose access to physical books has been made difficult due to school and public library closures during the national lockdown.
Nick Perchard, Head of Community at the Premier League said: “Through the Premier League Primary Stars programme we now engage more than 18,000 schools in England and Wales, either through the in-school support provided by professional football clubs or via the free online educational resources.
“This World Book Day, we are extremely happy to be able to further aid children’s education by putting free books into the hands of five to 11-year-olds. This is another important way our long-standing partnership with the National Literacy Trust is supporting children with literacy and encouraging them to develop a love of reading.”
To further support pupils on World Book Day, the National Literacy Trust will host a fun-filled Premier League Primary Stars Facebook Live event, with the authors of the Football School title being distributed, Alex Bellos and Ben Lyttleton. The one-hour event will include a quiz featuring a special round of questions set by players from the Premier League, the EFL and the Women’s Super League.
Jim Sells, Sport and Literacy Programme Manager at the National Literacy Trust said: “We are proud partners of the World Book Day charity, which promotes reading for pleasure to improve all children’s life chances. We know that children who have books at home do better in school but there are so many children who still don’t have a book of their own. We are delighted to be able to distribute such an incredible number of books to schools across the country with our friends at the Premier League.
“I’m also very excited for the Facebook Live event with Kenzie Benali, Ben Lyttleton and Alex Bellos, three brilliantly energetic personalities who inspire children to get into reading through their love of football.”

Academy’s rapid improvement highlighted – Education Today,"['Academies', 'Leadership', 'News', 'Professional Development', 'Training', 'Wellbeing']","March 2, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/academys-rapid-improvement-highlighted/,"A Coventry academy’s rapid improvement across all departments, since being established in 2015 has been highlighted – with hopes that the lessons it has learnt will support other schools converting to academy status.
The Romero Catholic Academy, made up of seven primary schools and one secondary school based across Coventry, has announced its latest staff survey results which demonstrate just how far it has come in four years.
The Romero Catholic Academy launched its survey in 2016 and has since held them at the end of 2018 and 2020, asking employees about their understanding of the Academies strategy, how satisfied they are with management, staff and pay benefits, their role, teamwork, change, decision making, culture and values.
Despite the latest survey being held during the Covid-19 pandemic, it highlighted improvements across the board, including some significant positive changes.
This includes staff believing that their work is valued by their line manager, with almost 92 per cent of employees agreeing or strongly agreeing with this compared with 83 per cent in 2016, and that their wellbeing is considered in the workplace, with almost 83 per cent agreeing or strongly agreeing compared with 68 per cent in 2016.
Almost 90 per cent of staff surveyed also said they would recommend the Academy as a good place to work compared with 69 per cent in 2016.
Patrick Taggart, Director of Operations at the Academy, said: “Uniting eight separate schools to form a Multi-Academy Company comes with its challenges, but one thing we wanted to focus on from the start was staff satisfaction to help ensure we were an employer of choice.
“One thing we learnt early on was that the Academy’s vision, mission and aims were key in joining the schools together, so we ensured these were not just on posters and in marketing, but spoken about in performance management, covered at key events such as our annual staff conference and included in our strategic plan.
“Going from just 63 per cent of staff agreeing or strongly agreeing that they understand the Academy’s strategy in 2016 to almost 90 per cent at the end of 2020 is an achievement we should be proud of.
“Our management styles have also developed, and whereas everyone used to have their own individual styles, school leaders are now shaped by our vision, mission and aims.
“As part of this we have developed our performance management processes, adopting a culture of listening, praising and appreciating employees and giving staff the opportunity to provide feedback and be involved in decisions that will affect their job roles.
“Although teamwork was highlighted as a strength when we set up the Academy, this was when the schools still thought of themselves as separate entities, so the fact we have managed to improve these results further is testament to the joined-up approach we promote.
“Job satisfaction has also improved, and a key thing that has been a driving force behind this is how we have improved the working environment at each school, thanks to how we have handled our finances since becoming an Academy.
“We have invested hugely in technology with laptops now being replaced every three years, the installation of Promethean whiteboards in every classroom and each school receiving new LED lighting – all made possible by making savings through rationalising the supplier base and bringing services such as catering and IT in-house.
“A key part of setting up the Academy was gaining the trust of our staff, and it’s clear from our results that we have made huge progress, particularly in the last two years when we have seen some dramatic increases in employee satisfaction.
“This improved mindset within our 500 staff means we are able to deliver a better provision for our children, providing them with better life chances, which is what we strive for.”
Patrick added: “Our next steps will be improving communication with employees across all levels even further by implementing a new staff intranet site, as well as encouraging more staff innovation.
“But we want to also use these results to support other schools making that transition to Academy status or those who have already begun the process, sharing our knowledge of what we have learnt to support the education sector.”

BBC launches Young Composer 2021 competition – Education Today,"['Competition', 'KS3', 'KS4', 'KS5', 'Music, Stage & Drama', 'News']","February 25, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/bbc-launches-young-composer-2021-competition/,"The BBC is calling on young musicians from across the country to enter its BBC Young Composer competition in 2021.
BBC Young Composer has launched countless musical careers since its inception in 1998. Formerly known as the BBC Proms Inspire competition, since rebranding in 2020 with a mission to reach a wider pool of talent, last year saw the highest ever number of entries. Entrants embraced a wide range of musical styles, with influences ranging from hip-hop and electronica to contemporary classical and orchestral film music. Inspiration for their works came from a wide variety of subjects including racial identity, the natural world and the Covid-19 pandemic.
The BBC is seeking musically-minded students aged 12 – 18 of all technical abilities, backgrounds, and musical influences to submit an original composition and recording. Any genre, any instruments, and any method of composing are welcome – music-makers may not think of themselves as a composer, but if they love to create their own original music then the BBC wants to hear from them. All compositions are judged anonymously and assessed on their compositional idea, creativity and originality.
Winners will be given the brilliant opportunity to participate in a tailored development programme working with a mentor composer on a project with the BBC Concert Orchestra, culminating in a performance or broadcast opportunity.
In what’s been a challenging year for so many young people, BBC Young Composer hopes to inspire young people from all over the UK to get creative and submit their work.
David Pickard, Director of BBC Proms, says: “There is a wealth of musical talent across the UK, and it’s more important than ever to nurture the next generation of music-makers from every style and genre. It’s been a privilege to watch previous winners develop as composers, and last year’s competition saw such variety – not only in musical style, but also in inspiration with thought-provoking themes explored. The BBC is incredibly proud to be able to offer these mentorship opportunities for young musical innovators and we look forward to hearing from aspiring composers working in all genres.”
The competition sits at the heart of BBC Young Composer, which has offered a platform for hundreds of young composers aged 12 – 18 from across the UK to further their artistic and professional ambitions. Many of today’s leading composers are counted in the outstanding list of BBC Young Composer alumni, including Shiva Feshareki, Kate Whitley, Alissa Firsova, Mark Simpson, Tom Harrold, and Duncan Ward.
BBC Young Composer remains committed to assisting its alumni in launching their careers through its Ambassador scheme, connecting composers to commissioning opportunities at the BBC. Recent alumni, including Grace-Evangeline Mason, Alex Woolf, Xia Leon Sloane and Sarah Jenkins, have been commissioned by BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4, BBC Concert Orchestra and BBC Proms.
The judging panel for the 2021 Young Composer Competition will be announced in due course.

Schools in Scotland encouraged to use free video content provided though the National e-Learning Partnership and ClickView – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'News', 'Resources', 'Scotland', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","February 18, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/schools-in-scotland-encouraged-to-use-free-video-content-provided-though-the-national-e-learning-partnership-and-clickview/,"To help teachers engage students in remote learning the National e-Learning Partnership and leading video content provider, ClickView, are offering all schools across Scotland free access to their full range of dynamic, highly visual resources.
Already trusted by many Scottish schools and local authorities including Edinburgh and Inverclyde, ClickView was selected to host and stream the National e-Learning Partnership’s West OS pre-recorded content, providing a secure and reliable vehicle to share a growing bank of over 1000 valuable, teacher recorded videos, with schools across Scotland.
In addition to this, the National e-Learning Partnership agreed with ClickView to offer all schools across Scotland the opportunity to have full use of its high-quality curriculum aligned content to supplement and extend the West OS provision. The three-month agreement valued at nearly £500k is currently being offered until the end of March, to support schools through lockdown.
Gayle Gorman, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, said, “Schools and practitioners are working hard to develop and deliver remote learning across the country. It’s fantastic that practitioners in Scotland now have free access to ClickView’s educational videos to provide additional support for the work they are doing locally at this time. Complementing the National e-Learning offer, this further strengthens the overall national offer of support for remote learning.”
Michael Wilkinson, managing director of ClickView, said, “As lockdown continues, the majority of teachers are finding it increasingly hard to motivate their students. Today’s students’ preferred format of information consumption is video. Curriculum aligned video-based learning content brings together movement and noise to convey an efficient message and capture their attention.
“ClickView and the National e-Learning Partnership encourage all schools to take up this offer to help them through the current challenges of remote learning. This doesn’t just mean learning can continue outside of physical classrooms, but provides the opportunity to revitalise traditional education practices, putting transformative world-class resources at their fingertips, for meaningful experiences at all levels of learning.”
John Stuart, workstream lead officer at the West Partnership, said, “We are delighted that West OS is hosted on ClickView because it provides the ideal platform for learners and school staff in Scotland to access on demand, high quality educational content as part of the National e-Learning Offer. ClickView’s current offer of free access to their educational videos until the end of March, complements the continually growing bank of West OS content to provide excellent support for remote learning.”

Growing ransomware threat to schools highlights data backup risks – Education Today,"['Comment', 'News']","February 16, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/growing-ransomware-threat-to-schools-highlights-data-backup-risks/,"Comment by Charlie Smith, Consulting Solution Engineer, Data Protection at Barracuda Networks 
As students and teachers are forced out of the classroom due to the COVID-19 crisis, cybercriminals are exploiting the security vulnerabilities in distance learning and virtual teaching setups to launch ransomware attacks against education institutions.
This increase is in the context of a broader rise in the number of ransomware attacks anyway – research shows 51% of businesses were impacted by ransomware in the last year and that an attack now takes place every 11 seconds since the start of 2021. But the UK education sector is now firmly in attackers’ cross hairs.
The threat is so serious that the UK’s Department for Education and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) put out an alert to school leaders last autumn and the NCSC said it has been investigating an increased number of ransomware attacks affecting UK education establishments since August 2020. Even prior to the pandemic, almost a third of UK schools admitted suffering a malware or ransomware attack in 2019.
This trend isn’t limited to the UK either. The Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency and the FBI have both warned about increased ransomware attacks targeting K-12 (primary and secondary) institutions in the US, too.
Research by Emsisoft also shows that the education sector in the US disclosed 31 ransomware incidents in the third quarter of 2020 – up from eight incidents the previous quarter (although there is a caveat here that there is a historical year-on-year trend for ransomware attacks on schools to spike after the summer ahead of the academic year starting in autumn).
How safe is your Microsoft Office 365 cloud?
The growing use of cloud environments by schools and colleges to support home learning, particularly Microsoft Office 365 – Outlook, Teams, and OneDrive and applications such as Satchel One, is just one of the ways that attackers are able to find a way in and steal data or hold an organisation to ransom.
Yet there is still an all too common misconception that because your data is in the cloud it can’t be affected by ransomware. That simply isn’t true.
For example, a child browsing the web on their school tablet or laptop at home can easily be tricked into clicking on a malicious link by accident. If that device is connected and synced to OneDrive as part of the school’s Office 365 account, a ransomware file can be automatically uploaded to OneDrive and encrypt school’s files and data held in the Microsoft cloud.
I’ve also seen examples where SharePoint, Exchange and other data sources have been hit. And if network drives are mapped to document libraries in Office 365 using the ‘open with Explorer’ feature, the ransomware can also scan for and infect files on connected drives.
Despite these examples, many organisations still labour under the misapprehension that they don’t need to worry because the data hosted in their Office 365 cloud is protected by Microsoft. In our own survey, nearly 40% of respondents said they believed that Microsoft provides everything they need to protect their Office 365 environment.
Yes, Microsoft does have some limited features to restore deleted files. But surely it doesn’t need to be said that recovering deleted files from the recycle bin in OneDrive isn’t a recommended backup strategy. Neither is email archiving, which doesn’t allow you to restore a complete mailbox and all of its contents to a single point in time.
It may be buried in the terms and conditions, but even Microsoft recommends that organisations use a third-party solution to backup and protect their data.

NewVIc students embark on research project with Oxford University – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'Diversity', 'FE colleges', 'History', 'News']","February 15, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/newvic-students-embark-on-research-project-with-oxford-university/,"Whilst undertaking research for a book they are co-writing on Charlie Hutchinson, Carina Ancell and Alan Kunna, two history teachers at NewVIc, identified the need for a specialist place which led to the opening of the African Studies Centre at the College. The new African Studies Centre, the first of its kind – equips teachers with the skills and knowledge to teach students about the history of Africa, doing away with a tradition of learning about this diverse continent through the lens of European Colonialism.
On this new project students will help to uncover more about the life of Charlie Hutchison, the first black British volunteer in the Spanish Civil War. Charlie had a fascinating life which reflects many wider themes in British history and politics; these include the history of anti-fascist movements and working-class political radicalism in East London; racial identity in the 20th century; black involvement in the World Wars.
All the sessions on the new project will be led by senior Oxford University professors and PhD students delivering lectures on topics related to the life of Charlie Hutchison but reflecting on its wider significance for modern Britain and its relationship with Africa.
What is known of Charlie? Charlie Hutchison was born in Oxfordshire 1918 and died in 1993. His father was from the Gold Coast (Ghana) in West Africa and his mother was an English woman. He was the fourth of five children of this marriage. In 1936, when he was 17 Charlie travelled to Spain to join the International Brigade (IB) which fought on the side of the Republic against General Franco’s Fascist Army. Shortly after he returned to England WWII broke out and he joined the British Army in 1940 and served until 1946.
Until recently little has been known about Charlie apart from a small file held within the Comintern archives (communist international) in Moscow, as details of his time in Spain remained in the public domain.
Thanks to research undertaken on the last project by NewVIc students and staff Carina and Alan in collaboration with the Marx Memorial Library in London, more has been found out about Hutchison. First a photo of him was discovered, and then contact was made with his family. NewVIc students were invited to a special event to discuss their findings and present to seventeen members of Charlie Hutchison’s family. Prior to this project he was known only as the only black British volunteer in the International Brigade that fought against Fascism in the Spanish Civil War 1936-1939.
The innovative programme is set to commence in March 2021 and is designed for any students interested in modern history, politics, the history of their local area, or exploring racial identity. It will also enable students to develop their independent research and critical thinking skills, conduct archival research with Marx Memorial Library and provide an opportunity to prepare students for applying to Oxford or other Russell Group universities.
Noah Enahoro, former project participant and Honours and A Level student, said: “I was honoured to be part of this project, Charlie Hutchison’s story would not have been told if we had not carried out this research into him, and discovered all that he has done throughout his life. I am so glad that we were able to do this, I feel inspired in terms of how Charlie carried himself in what he did and achieved in times of stigma in Britain, he used his experiences of oppression to motivate himself to fight against that in the Spanish Civil War. His story is small yet it has a huge impact because it highlights that there were others fighting besides him whose stories have not been told. This story highlights that there were people of other races in big movements but not as represented to us when we study history in the national curriculum pre-university. I really enjoyed telling his story to his family and reminding them of how great he was and to share this with the wider public.”
Alan Kunna, Programme Team Manager and Teacher of History, added: “This is a fantastic and exciting project for students to get involved in on our super curricular programme. Much of what we consider to be black history in Britain – The history of the African diaspora in Britain and the Americas is undergoing a radical genesis. No longer are people content to study the black America as if it were the only black history. Today’s historians are looking into the experience of people in Great Britain and its Empire. What they are uncovering is a rich and diverse history that turns on its head old assumptions and beliefs. It also shows that much of the contemporary white, black and minority ethnic experience is rooted in the development and history of Empire and Post Imperial developments. Today we are celebrating the life of Charlie Hutchison and his siblings. He and they are no longer hidden from public history but take their place amongst those whose experience will deepen our understanding of the history of the people of these Islands and beyond. People of colour have been in the British Isles since the Romans, and they have played a part in shaping the nation from Cable Street, to Spain, to the Battlegrounds of WWII and beyond”.",whilst

Archery targets primary schools as ideal socially distanced sport for all ages and abilities – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Inclusion', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Sport & Play']","February 9, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/archery-targets-primary-schools-as-ideal-socially-distanced-sport-for-all-ages-and-abilities/,"As families struggle through lockdown, with many juggling home-schooling alongside their own commitments often working from home, it’s clear that physical activity for children unable to access regular PE lessons has become restricted by limited time and opportunity.
In response to this potential crisis, Archery GB is approaching primary schools to offer nationwide participation in a sport with universal appeal, regardless of gender – one that is fun and inclusive and can be enjoyed at school with classmates and at archery clubs with other friends and family members.
Archery GB strongly believes sport and physical activity has a big role to play in improving both the physical and mental health of the nation, supporting the economy, reconnecting communities and rebuilding a stronger society for all. Its strategic vision for the next 10 years sets out how UK sport needs to change as a sector and an ecosystem, ensuring everyone has the opportunities they need, now and in the future.
More than anything, Archery GB is determined to tackle the inequalities long seen in sport and physical activity, providing opportunities to people and communities that have traditionally been left behind and helping to remove all barriers to engagement across all sectors of society.
This complements Sport England’s strategy to put sport and physical activity at the heart of the nation’s recovery, bringing a new and diverse sporting activity to schools and providing the practical means to introduce ‘soft’ archery for all young children.
Sport truly can be for all
It has long been recognised that the range of sports available for children at school may currently only appeal to a small percentage of pupils since not all children are gifted with the same sporting genes and talents as others, and sport can therefore become a competition for the fittest or the fastest that many do not want to or cannot join.
Archery is a non-traditional sport that is currently enjoyed by over 5,500 under 18s who already participate in the UK. It can be learnt relatively quickly and undertaken indoors or out. Its many physical and mental health benefits are evident and ready to be shared by the nationwide school community, all the while following naturally socially distanced guidelines.
An Olympic sport with more to give
Archery is an established Olympic and Paralympic sport that is keen to extend its reach to the younger community by way of a simple, low cost, ‘soft’ Arrows kit available for use by primary teachers nationwide. Launched in partnership with Clickers Archery Ltd, the Archery GB Arrows Programme provides teachers with child-friendly equipment, lesson plans and ideas for activities and competitions. Archery GB is currently running a competition to win a first prize of a Three-bow Arrows Taster Pack with two Home Edition Arrows kits for the runners-up.
Archery is also part of the School Games funded by Sport England National Lottery and in the 2018/19 academic year (the latest for which data is available) 145 archery school competitions took place involving 8,902 inter school participants and 1,290 inter school archery teams. It is hoped that the current initiative will help extend access to archery widely across the UK primary school community.
By providing this opportunity for many more children to experience archery in the school environment, this ready-made sporting activity can be activated quickly and easily and introduced to the classroom by primary teachers without any training. With the prospect of success at the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo later this year, the time and more importantly the fit is right for archery to take its place on the wider curriculum in UK primary schools.
Taking the initiative for schools
Archery is an inclusive sport that can be enjoyed by children of all ages including those with disabilities who would struggle to take part in an alternative form of exercise.
Commenting on the commitment of archery to develop and support a diverse participation base across all school communities, Neil Armitage, CEO at Archery GB said “We want to offer children a new participation sport that will benefit them physically and mentally as we address the issues left behind by the Coronavirus pandemic. For too long, people with the most to gain from being active have been the least able to take part.
“As a result of the huge disruption 2020 has caused, and the inequalities the pandemic has reinforced or even exacerbated – around both socio-economic status and ethnicity – our drive to do things differently and confront these inequalities head on is stronger than ever.
“This equipment will enable schools to initiate an activity for young children that will benefit their immediate well-being. We are also encouraging and training new instructors so those who engage with the sport at a young age can take a Beginner’s course and develop their passion further. Our goal is to give all children the opportunity to have a go at archery either via their primary school or at a local archery club.”

Thrybergh Academy and Foljambe Primary School officially join Wickersley Partnership Trust (WPT) – Education Today,"['Academies', 'MATs', 'News']","February 3, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/thrybergh-academy-and-foljambe-primary-school-officially-join-wickersley-partnership-trust-wpt/,"On 1st February 2021, Thrybergh Academy (pictured) and Foljambe Primary School officially became academies under Rotherham-based multi-academy trust, Wickersley Partnership Trust (WPT).
Thrybergh Academy and Foljambe Primary School have joined 11 other schools – 7 primaries and 4 secondaries – under WPT’s umbrella.
The vision for both of the schools echoes WPT’s key aim – to send every young person into the world able and qualified to play their full role in it.
David Burnham, Headteacher at Thrybergh Academy said: “We are delighted to officially become part of Wickersley Partnership Trust after having been supported by the Trust for the past two years. The support that the school has had means that we are now in a position to drive forward our aim of providing all of our students with an outstanding education. Being part of a local multi-academy trust is important for us because all of the schools within it truly have a voice and this means the needs of our communities are fully understood and catered for. Thrybergh Academy is now part of a caring, ambitious family of schools and we look forward to what the future holds for our students, staff and local community.”
Academising under the Trust means that both schools receive funding directly from the government rather than local authorities. Other benefits include more control over how things are done within the schools and access to more readily available support and advice to raise the standards of the schools.
Foljambe Primary School has already started improving the school facilities after joining WPT with plans to rebuild the campus starting at the end of February.
Beverley Tate-Brier, Headteacher at Foljambe Primary School added: “This is a very exciting time for the future of Foljambe. We have been working in partnership with Wickersley Partnership Trust for some time now and we are proud of the changes we have already made in moving the school forward. We cannot wait for the building work to take place to give our children and their families an environment that they deserve.”
Steve Calvert, Chair of Directors at Wickersley Partnership Trust added: “The Trust had long discussions about whether we should bring Thrybergh into our family of schools – lots of debates about financial risks and capacity.
“In the end the core question was ‘did we feel we could help the students become happier and have better life outcomes?’ and we believe the answer is yes. We are delighted to bring the schools on board and I’m sure the talented team and amazing students will ensure it’ll be a success story for years to come.”
Helen O’Brien, CEO at Wickersley Partnership Trust added: “At Wickersley Partnership Trust, we aspire to send all young people into an ever-changing world, able and qualified to play their full part in it. The students at Thrybergh Academy and Foljambe Primary School deserve every opportunity to meet these same goals.
“We have worked with both schools for two years and already have a strong and embedded ethos of collaboration between our schools.
“We are building on the school curriculum to provide rich opportunities for learning, both within and outside the classroom, and will ensure all stakeholders are empowered to work in partnership.
“We have already begun the regeneration of the primary campus and look forward to opening this new site with its extensive improvements.”
Wickersley Partnership Trust was founded in 2014 and serves a community of 13 schools across Rotherham and Gainsborough – ‘one school across multiple sites’. It is committed to ensuring all students have the best educational experience possible by raising achievement by providing active, co-operative and independent learning through dynamic, high quality teaching.

Mentor sessions help students plan for careers – Education Today,"['Careers', 'Engineering', 'England', 'News', 'Secondary schools', 'STEM', 'Student engagement']","February 2, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/mentor-sessions-help-students-plan-for-careers/,"Students from Blackburn are being inspired to explore jobs with the support of our region’s employers.
Year 9 and 10 Pupils at Our Lady and St John Catholic College in Shadsworth, have been working with volunteers from the National Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) Ambassador programme who represent companies in the area to discuss career opportunities.
The sessions designed and delivered by local education company STEMFirst, and funded by Future U, allow the students to learn about the possibilities of STEM careers and hear first-hand what they need to do to study for a job in the sector.
The students link with mentors who can advise them on career routes, and give them an insight into industry. The sessions have proved popular so far, with most students saying they had learnt new skills and given them useful information and advice.
The sessions are designed to help more students from the area explore the career opportunities available if they continue into higher education after finishing high school, as well as preparing students with the skills needed to apply for university places, live away from home for the first time, and apply for jobs.
Theo Blackburn (left), Programme Manager at Future U, said: “We are delighted to be working with STEMFirst again to continue to support pupils despite the many challenges that schools are currently facing.
“Now more than ever, it is important to provide young people with an inspirational careers programme to encourage and motivate them. This mentoring programme allows pupils to hear from local employers and develop employability skills that will help them in their future careers, especially if they decide to pursue a career within STEM.”
Sue Hargreaves, Director, STEMFirst, who run the STEM Ambassador HUB for Lancashire and Cumbria said: “The FutureU Mentoring Programme is a great opportunity for learners to start to think about the skills they need to develop, to face their own future careers with confidence, and meet real people who put those skills into practice.”
Since launching in 2017, Future U has held more than 800 events and activities to support over 16,000 young people to think about applying for university. The programme works alongside the county’s four universities and 10 colleges throughout Lancashire and has continued to deliver activities online during the lockdown.
In addition to promoting the benefits of university to prospective students, the programme also supports young people to understand student finance, living away from home and raising career ambitions to develop the next set of skilled workers for the county.
Future U is part of the national Uni Connect Programme, funded by the Office for Students, and continues to support school pupils across Lancashire to encourage more young people to think about higher education and future careers. The project involves institutions and organisations across the county including the University of Central Lancashire, Lancaster University, Edge Hill University and the University of Cumbria.
Lancashire’s Future U works with a network of schools, in addition to colleges, higher education providers and local agencies to create tailored activities to meet the needs of students for now and the future.
Its list of partners includes: Blackburn College, Blackpool Sixth Form College, Blackpool and the Fylde College, Burnley College, Edge Hill University, Inspira, Kendal College, Lancaster University, Myerscough College, Nelson and Colne College, Preston’s College, STEMFirst, Runshaw College, The Lancashire Colleges, University of Central Lancashire, University of Cumbria, West Lancashire College.",student from blackburn are being inspired to explore job with the support of our region employer year and pupil at our lady and st john catholic college in shadsworth have been working with volunteer from the national science technology engineering and math stem ambassador programme who represent company in the area to discus career opportunity the session designed and delivered by local education company stemfirst and funded by future u allow the student to learn about the possibility of stem career and hear firsthand what they need to do to study for a job in the sector the student link with mentor who can advise them on career route and give them an insight into industry the session have proved popular so far with most student saying they had learnt new skill and given them useful information and advice the session are designed to help more student from the area explore the career opportunity available if they continue into higher education after finishing high school a well a preparing student with the skill needed to apply for university place live away from home for the first time and apply for job theo blackburn left programme manager at future u said we are delighted to be working with stemfirst again to continue to support pupil despite the many challenge that school are currently facing now more than ever it is important to provide young people with an inspirational career programme to encourage and motivate them this mentoring programme allows pupil to hear from local employer and develop employability skill that will help them in their future career especially if they decide to pursue a career within stem sue hargreaves director stemfirst who run the stem ambassador hub for lancashire and cumbria said the futureu mentoring programme is a great opportunity for learner to start to think about the skill they need to develop to face their own future career with confidence and meet real people who put those skill into practice since launching in future u ha held more than event and activity to support over young people to think about applying for university the programme work alongside the county four university and college throughout lancashire and ha continued to deliver activity online during the lockdown in addition to promoting the benefit of university to prospective student the programme also support young people to understand student finance living away from home and raising career ambition to develop the next set of skilled worker for the county future u is part of the national uni connect programme funded by the office for student and continues to support school pupil across lancashire to encourage more young people to think about higher education and future career the project involves institution and organisation across the county including the university of central lancashire lancaster university edge hill university and the university of cumbria lancashire future u work with a network of school in addition to college higher education provider and local agency to create tailored activity to meet the need of student for now and the future it list of partner includes blackburn college blackpool sixth form college blackpool and the fylde college burnley college edge hill university inspira kendal college lancaster university myerscough college nelson and colne college prestons college stemfirst runshaw college the lancashire college university of central lancashire university of cumbria west lancashire college,"['education', 'employability', 'university', 'science', 'mentor', 'student', 'online', 'manager', 'mentoring', 'volunteer']"
World’s first IB special autism school appoints Deputy Headteacher – Education Today,"['Appointments', 'News', 'SEND']","February 1, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/worlds-first-ib-special-autism-school-appoints-deputy-headteacher/,"The Cavendish School, the world’s first International Baccalaureate (IB) special autism school, opening on the outskirts of Cambridge in Autumn 2021, has appointed Stephanie Smith as its Deputy Headteacher.
The Cavendish School will also be Cambridgeshire’s first state maintained special free school for young people with autism, and Stephanie joins having previously worked at Medeshamstede Academy in Peterborough, a similar size school with just over 100 students aged 4 – 16 with autism.
Discussing her appointment, Stephanie said: “My heart lies in working with children and young people with autism and it is my mission to support students in achieving success and thriving in their adult lives. This is why the aim of The Cavendish School stood out to me – to provide a safe, nurturing space, alongside inclusive and comprehensive support so that all students thrive. I am looking forward to working with the students and their families throughout the entirety of their educational journey.”
Stephanie has been involved in the autism community for over 10 years, working within mainstream primaries, secondaries and special needs schools. She trained in Mathematics at Stanground Academy, before going on to complete a national award for special educational needs coordination. Stephanie has already started supporting The Cavendish School as well as the Local Authority with the admission of students and is engaging with IB training to ensure the curriculum is both aligned with the IB philosophy as well as meeting the specific needs of the school community.
The Cavendish School aspires to support students in its mission of ‘enabling the self’; equipping students with the skills, confidence and abilities to take their place in the world. Initially the school will admit around 40 students (Years 3 to 7) and will then grow, year on year, to a maximum capacity of 80 students, aged 7 to 19 years (Years 3 to 13).
Ryan Kelsall, Deputy CEO of Eastern Learning Alliance, of which The Cavendish School is part, said: “As we move ever closer to our official opening date, it’s fantastic to bring Stephanie onto the team. I know that through her expertise and knowledge, we will be able to deliver exemplary education provision for students with Educational Health Care Plans and remove the barriers to inclusion and achievement that many young people with autism face within their education.”",the cavendish school the world first international baccalaureate ib special autism school opening on the outskirt of cambridge in autumn ha appointed stephanie smith a it deputy headteacher the cavendish school will also be cambridgeshires first state maintained special free school for young people with autism and stephanie join having previously worked at medeshamstede academy in peterborough a similar size school with just over student aged with autism discussing her appointment stephanie said my heart lie in working with child and young people with autism and it is my mission to support student in achieving success and thriving in their adult life this is why the aim of the cavendish school stood out to me to provide a safe nurturing space alongside inclusive and comprehensive support so that all student thrive i am looking forward to working with the student and their family throughout the entirety of their educational journey stephanie ha been involved in the autism community for over year working within mainstream primary secondary and special need school she trained in mathematics at stanground academy before going on to complete a national award for special educational need coordination stephanie ha already started supporting the cavendish school a well a the local authority with the admission of student and is engaging with ib training to ensure the curriculum is both aligned with the ib philosophy a well a meeting the specific need of the school community the cavendish school aspires to support student in it mission of enabling the self equipping student with the skill confidence and ability to take their place in the world initially the school will admit around student year to and will then grow year on year to a maximum capacity of student aged to year year to ryan kelsall deputy ceo of eastern learning alliance of which the cavendish school is part said a we move ever closer to our official opening date it fantastic to bring stephanie onto the team i know that through her expertise and knowledge we will be able to deliver exemplary education provision for student with educational health care plan and remove the barrier to inclusion and achievement that many young people with autism face within their education,"['learning', 'educational', 'student', 'mathematics', 'medeshamstede', 'education', 'cambridge', 'ceo', 'autism', 'headteacher']"
NFER and EEF publish interim findings on impact of Covid-19 on school closures – Education Today,"['Attainment', 'Coronavirus', 'KS1', 'Literacy', 'Maths', 'News', 'Research', 'Social issues']","January 29, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/nfer-and-eef-publish-interim-findings-on-impact-of-covid-19-on-school-closures/,"The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) has published the interim findings from a study assessing the extent to which Key Stage 1 pupils’ attainment in reading and maths were impacted by partial school closures during the first national Covid-19 lockdown, and particularly the effect on disadvantaged pupils. This paper focuses on the gap in attainment likely caused by March 2020 school closures (commonly called ‘learning loss’), and the disadvantage gap for Year 2 children as measured in autumn 2020.
The findings suggest that primary-age pupils have significantly lower achievement in both reading and maths as a likely result of missed learning. In addition, there is a large and concerning attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and non-disadvantaged pupils.
This study is one of the first to provide robust insights into the extent of learning loss that might have occurred as a result of partial school closures. It is based on data collected by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) from assessments in reading and maths taken in November 2020 by more than 5,900 Year 2 (6 / 7 year olds) pupils in 168 representative primary schools. These were compared with tests taken by Year 2 pupils in autumn 2017, also from a representative sample of schools.
Overall performance in both reading and mathematics in autumn 2020 was found to be significantly lower compared to the 2017 cohort, with pupils, on average, making two months less progress in both subject areas compared to the standardisation sample. Worryingly, the study finds that “a very large number of pupils were unable to engage effectively with the tests”.
The study also finds a large and concerning gap between the attainment of disadvantaged pupils and non-disadvantaged pupils. For both reading and maths this gap is estimated to be the equivalent of seven months’ learning. While both calculations indicate a large gap, the results, expressed in terms of months of learning, should be interpreted with caution.
The 2017 NFER assessment data did not compare the performance of disadvantaged pupils with all other pupils. As a result, it is not known if the gap has grown compared to 2017.
These interim findings are part of an ongoing EEF-funded study. Further analysis will be carried out in March 2021 and June 2021 to examine whether the gap narrows, widens or remains stable. In addition to these preliminary findings, NFER is preparing a short publication for teachers that will include more detailed commentary on pupils’ responses and suggestions that schools can act upon.
Last June, the EEF published a rapid evidence assessment, Best evidence on impact of school closures on the attainment gap, which found that school closures are likely to reverse progress made to close the gap in the last decade since 2011.
Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust and chairman of the Education Endowment Foundation, said: “By the time schools reopen, children and young people will have faced almost a year of learning disruption. The repercussions of these months of lost learning are devastating and will be felt for a lifetime, especially by those from low-income backgrounds.
“Today’s findings give valuable insight into the challenges facing schools and teachers.  Vast resources need to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils by raising the pupil premium significantly and providing funding for tuition.”
Professor Becky Francis, CEO of the Education Endowment Foundation, said: “This new research offers compelling evidence of what we have feared since schools were closed to most pupils in the first national lockdown – that there will be a large negative impact on learning, with disadvantaged pupils suffering the most. Despite the inspiring and tireless work of schools across the country, this will only be compounded by the current partial school closures.
“It is vital, therefore, that we draw on the best available evidence in responding to this national crisis, supporting teachers and school leaders to get the right support to the pupils who have missed out most.
“But we should be under no illusions that there are quick fixes. Schools will need continued and significant support in the years ahead if we are to avoid a generation of pupils being left behind. This latest research highlights, yet again, the need, to make tackling educational inequality a national priority.”
Dr Ben Styles, head of the National Foundation for Educational Research’s Education Trials Unit said: “There has been lots of speculation about the extent to which children may have fallen behind and it is valuable to report some attainment data on this question.
“Measuring gaps in test scores is not much use to teachers without more diagnostic information concerning where children have fallen behind and we hope to provide this imminently.”",the education endowment foundation eef ha published the interim finding from a study assessing the extent to which key stage pupil attainment in reading and math were impacted by partial school closure during the first national covid lockdown and particularly the effect on disadvantaged pupil this paper focus on the gap in attainment likely caused by march school closure commonly called learning loss and the disadvantage gap for year child a measured in autumn the finding suggest that primaryage pupil have significantly lower achievement in both reading and math a a likely result of missed learning in addition there is a large and concerning attainment gap between disadvantaged pupil and nondisadvantaged pupil this study is one of the first to provide robust insight into the extent of learning loss that might have occurred a a result of partial school closure it is based on data collected by the national foundation for educational research nfer from assessment in reading and math taken in november by more than year year old pupil in representative primary school these were compared with test taken by year pupil in autumn also from a representative sample of school overall performance in both reading and mathematics in autumn wa found to be significantly lower compared to the cohort with pupil on average making two month le progress in both subject area compared to the standardisation sample worryingly the study find that a very large number of pupil were unable to engage effectively with the test the study also find a large and concerning gap between the attainment of disadvantaged pupil and nondisadvantaged pupil for both reading and math this gap is estimated to be the equivalent of seven month learning while both calculation indicate a large gap the result expressed in term of month of learning should be interpreted with caution the nfer assessment data did not compare the performance of disadvantaged pupil with all other pupil a a result it is not known if the gap ha grown compared to these interim finding are part of an ongoing eeffunded study further analysis will be carried out in march and june to examine whether the gap narrow widens or remains stable in addition to these preliminary finding nfer is preparing a short publication for teacher that will include more detailed commentary on pupil response and suggestion that school can act upon last june the eef published a rapid evidence assessment best evidence on impact of school closure on the attainment gap which found that school closure are likely to reverse progress made to close the gap in the last decade since sir peter lampl founder and chairman of the sutton trust and chairman of the education endowment foundation said by the time school reopen child and young people will have faced almost a year of learning disruption the repercussion of these month of lost learning are devastating and will be felt for a lifetime especially by those from lowincome background today finding give valuable insight into the challenge facing school and teacher vast resource need to be targeted at disadvantaged pupil by raising the pupil premium significantly and providing funding for tuition professor becky francis ceo of the education endowment foundation said this new research offer compelling evidence of what we have feared since school were closed to most pupil in the first national lockdown that there will be a large negative impact on learning with disadvantaged pupil suffering the most despite the inspiring and tireless work of school across the country this will only be compounded by the current partial school closure it is vital therefore that we draw on the best available evidence in responding to this national crisis supporting teacher and school leader to get the right support to the pupil who have missed out most but we should be under no illusion that there are quick fix school will need continued and significant support in the year ahead if we are to avoid a generation of pupil being left behind this latest research highlight yet again the need to make tackling educational inequality a national priority dr ben style head of the national foundation for educational research education trial unit said there ha been lot of speculation about the extent to which child may have fallen behind and it is valuable to report some attainment data on this question measuring gap in test score is not much use to teacher without more diagnostic information concerning where child have fallen behind and we hope to provide this imminently,"['tuition', 'november', 'disadvantaged', 'autumn', 'suffering', 'inequality', 'professor', 'mathematics', 'math', 'teacher']"
Prestigious Eco-Schools Green Flag awarded to Blackheath High School – Education Today,"['Awards', 'Environmental Focus', 'News']","January 28, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/prestigious-eco-schools-green-flag-awarded-to-blackheath-high-school/,"Blackheath High School has been awarded the prestigious Eco-Schools Green Flag, recognising its commitment to excellence in environmental action and learning.   


To be awarded the Green Flag, schools must lead initiatives and provide hands-on learning activities covering three of the Eco-School’s environmental topics. Blackheath High chose to tackle energy, waste and biodiversity. The girls learned about energy use, ran energy-saving switch-off campaigns that have reduced the school’s CO2 emissions, and carried out environment and energy audits. They also engaged with the local community, clearing litter and plastic waste from the street to help prevent it from reaching rivers and oceans. To increase biodiversity around the school, the girls built a minibeast hotel, a stag beetle nursery and introduced wildlife-friendly planting.   


These are just a handful of the initiatives Blackheath High has introduced to empower its students to have a positive impact on the environment. In celebration of its 140th Anniversary last year, Blackheath High invited all members of the school community to make environmentally-focused pledges to improve the local community and planet. One of its pledges was to be one of a handful of schools to introduce the study of ocean plastics to the curriculum. Blackheath High partnered with Common Seas, an anti-plastic pollution not-for-profit, to deliver this.


Carol Chandler-Thompson, Head of Blackheath High School said: “At Blackheath High we are all hyper-aware of the environmental crisis, and I am so proud of how committed our girls and staff have been in playing their part to combat it. This award is a real testament to their hard work. But it doesn’t stop here. We have many more exciting environmental initiatives in the pipeline which will see us make even more of a difference.”


Jo Royle, Founder of Common Seas, said: “We’re delighted that Blackheath High School has been awarded the Eco-Schools Green Flag. As one of the first schools to join our Ocean Plastics Academy, we have seen first-hand the commitment the whole school has to breaking free from plastic pollution and protecting our ocean. So a big congratulations to the next generation of sea champions!”",blackheath high school ha been awarded the prestigious ecoschools green flag recognising it commitment to excellence in environmental action and learning to be awarded the green flag school must lead initiative and provide handson learning activity covering three of the ecoschools environmental topic blackheath high chose to tackle energy waste and biodiversity the girl learned about energy use ran energysaving switchoff campaign that have reduced the school co emission and carried out environment and energy audit they also engaged with the local community clearing litter and plastic waste from the street to help prevent it from reaching river and ocean to increase biodiversity around the school the girl built a minibeast hotel a stag beetle nursery and introduced wildlifefriendly planting these are just a handful of the initiative blackheath high ha introduced to empower it student to have a positive impact on the environment in celebration of it th anniversary last year blackheath high invited all member of the school community to make environmentallyfocused pledge to improve the local community and planet one of it pledge wa to be one of a handful of school to introduce the study of ocean plastic to the curriculum blackheath high partnered with common sea an antiplastic pollution notforprofit to deliver this carol chandlerthompson head of blackheath high school said at blackheath high we are all hyperaware of the environmental crisis and i am so proud of how committed our girl and staff have been in playing their part to combat it this award is a real testament to their hard work but it doesnt stop here we have many more exciting environmental initiative in the pipeline which will see u make even more of a difference jo royle founder of common sea said were delighted that blackheath high school ha been awarded the ecoschools green flag a one of the first school to join our ocean plastic academy we have seen firsthand the commitment the whole school ha to breaking free from plastic pollution and protecting our ocean so a big congratulation to the next generation of sea champion,"['energysaving', 'blackheath', 'girl', 'carol', 'champion', 'biodiversity', 'wildlifefriendly', 'environmentallyfocused', 'environmental', 'ecoschools']"
Teacher training with a twist: How the NHS Deep Cleaning and Advisory Service is protecting staff and students during lockdown – Education Today,"['Buildings & Maintenance', 'Cleaning & Hygiene', 'Coronavirus', 'Health, Hygiene & Safety', 'News', 'Training']","January 26, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/teacher-training-with-a-twist-how-the-nhs-deep-cleaning-and-advisory-service-is-protecting-staff-and-students-during-lockdown/,"The NHS Deep Cleaning and Advisory Service is joining forces with schools across the UK to help protect staff, students and parents during the Covid-19 pandemic.
More than 30 schools across the country have so far partnered with the NHS service, which aims to extend the NHS standard of cleanliness to the wider community and support organisations with their infection control procedures during the pandemic and beyond.
Despite schools closing to the majority of pupils during the national lockdown, infection control remains one of the top priorities for the education sector. This is definitely the case for Billingham South Community Primary School in Stockton-on-Tees, which has kick-started the new year with staff training with a twist: a unique training programme teaching staff how to clean ‘the NHS way.’
Delivered by Tony Sullivan (left), the Environmental and Decontamination Services Manager based at University Hospital of North Tees and board member for the professional body for decontamination, the Institute of Decontamination Sciences, the NHS Deep Cleaning and Advisory Service training programme teaches the wider community how to clean ‘the NHS way’.
From touchpoint cleaning and application of disinfectants to ATP swab tests and how to remove PPE correctly, the training session covers a wide range of topics that have helped the team at Billingham South adapt the school’s cleaning strategy in line with the NHS standard, therefore helping to reduce the risk of infection.
By investing in the training programme from the NHS Deep Cleaning and Advisory Service, not only is the school enhancing its cleaning regime but it is also directly supporting the NHS. In addition to helping reduce the spread of infection in the local community and consequently easing pressure on local hospital Trusts, the income generated by the cleaning service is reinvested back into the NHS to support frontline patient care.
Edwin Squire, Headteacher at Billingham South, said: “Cleaning staff are very much at the forefront of this pandemic and it’s important they are equipped with the relevant knowledge, skills and equipment to help protect our staff, students and their loved ones at Billingham South.
“The training session delivered by the NHS Deep Cleaning and Advisory Service has been key to enhancing our cleaning regime at the school. Knowing how to clean in line with NHS standards has really boosted the confidence of our cleaning team and has better prepared our school for overcoming the coming challenges faced by the education sector due to the Covid-19 pandemic.”
Tony Sullivan, Environmental and Decontamination Services Manager at the NHS Deep Cleaning and Advisory Service, said: “As an NHS service, we are committed to supporting organisations across the UK with their infection control measures during the Covid-19 pandemic and thereafter.
“As I always say, prevention is better than cure and that’s why it’s important for organisations to ensure they have the correct cleaning procedures and knowledge in place to help stop the virus spreading in the first place. Having now provided deep cleaning, audits and training services to dozens of schools across the country, we look forward to continuing to build long-lasting relationships with the wider community and to support with their infection control long into the future.”

National dance company raising attainment in primary schools one dance step at a time – Education Today,"['Dance', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Scotland']","January 25, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/national-dance-company-raising-attainment-in-primary-schools-one-dance-step-at-a-time/,"Photo: Paul Watt Photography
YDance (Scottish Youth Dance) – the award-winning national dance organisation for children and young people in Scotland – have released the official findings of their innovative four-year primary education programme focusing on interdisciplinary learning and closing the poverty-related attainment gap.
In January 2017, YDance launched the Shake It Up programme to raise attainment for over 5,000 primary school children in areas identified as part of the Scottish Government’s Attainment Challenge – Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, West Dunbartonshire and Clackmannanshire.
Funded by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, Shake It Up was designed to enable children to learn a range of curriculum subjects through dance, increase pupils’ engagement through a kinaesthetic approach, and leave a sustainable legacy of teachers with the skills and knowledge to continue to develop this kind of integrated curricular lesson delivery. Sessions covered a range of subjects including numeracy, literacy, science, health and wellbeing, and social sciences.
Two full-time Dance Education Artists in Residence each worked one day a week across six primary schools for a period of two years to deliver the sessions. They worked in close partnership with selected teachers to plan and deliver the project ensuring the benchmarks of the subject were met through the dance workshops.
Running alongside the delivery programme, a research and evaluation impact study was carried out by the Robert Owen Centre for Educational Change at the University of Glasgow. The findings of the research are now available at www.ydance.org.",photo paul watt photography ydance scottish youth dance the awardwinning national dance organisation for child and young people in scotland have released the official finding of their innovative fouryear primary education programme focusing on interdisciplinary learning and closing the povertyrelated attainment gap in january ydance launched the shake it up programme to raise attainment for over primary school child in area identified a part of the scottish government attainment challenge glasgow north lanarkshire west dunbartonshire and clackmannanshire funded by the paul hamlyn foundation shake it up wa designed to enable child to learn a range of curriculum subject through dance increase pupil engagement through a kinaesthetic approach and leave a sustainable legacy of teacher with the skill and knowledge to continue to develop this kind of integrated curricular lesson delivery session covered a range of subject including numeracy literacy science health and wellbeing and social science two fulltime dance education artist in residence each worked one day a week across six primary school for a period of two year to deliver the session they worked in close partnership with selected teacher to plan and deliver the project ensuring the benchmark of the subject were met through the dance workshop running alongside the delivery programme a research and evaluation impact study wa carried out by the robert owen centre for educational change at the university of glasgow the finding of the research are now available at,"['education', 'science', 'kinaesthetic', 'clackmannanshire', 'fouryear', 'teacher', 'dunbartonshire', 'lanarkshire', 'awardwinning', 'dance']"
Can education change the world? – Education Today,"['Comment', 'News']","January 21, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/can-education-change-the-world/,"The educationalist Sarwar Khawaja (left) once remarked that education “is like the master key, it unlocks almost every door around the world”. Some of the biggest issues facing the globe have been helped through the power of education. Here are just some of the ways in which education has played an important role in changing the world.
Tackling world problems
Issues like Climate Change and the Covid-19 pandemic are global problems that need global solutions. Education has enabled countries to work together to reveal problems, and to develop ways to help. Education also helps citizens across the world to become part of the solution, educating us all on how we can contribute.
Revealing and solving inequality
Social inequalities can be difficult to discern, but education allows the world to uncover and to prevent inequalities leading to disadvantaged societies and communities. For example, ongoing efforts to raise funds for schooling in Africa tackles poverty by giving African people the tools to learn, gain the skills for a career and to improve their quality of life.
Developing nations
At the same time as helping individuals, education can also assist the development of entire countries. Particularly countries which have weaker or developing economies, education can help nations to establish the industries and expertise necessary to grow, which in turn helps those countries to reinvest in schooling and other vital public services such as healthcare.
Bridging divides
The sentiment goes that although we live on a diverse planet, there is more that unites than divides us. Education can make this statement true, by bringing communities together to learn collectively. There have been examples of this through history, particularly in the case of communities where there has previously been friction. Education can soothe those tensions, and foster better understanding.
Fostering peace
In fostering better understanding, education also fosters peace. Where there have been wars and tension, education can sideline conflict by focusing instead on the common issues that affect us all. By teaching people around the world about ways to develop, grow and improve, education can inhibit the potential for hostility and fighting.
Helping the world to grow
A phrase that you may have heard before is “give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime”. Education enables people across the planet to learn how to develop. This process of empowering our own educational development means that the whole world will grow, with new ideas, new inventions and new ways to improve lives.
Adding to his description of education as a “master key”, Khawaja also explains that education can eventually eradicate the need for locks entirely, opening up the world to a new sense of togetherness and openness.
Education can change the world in many ways, from enriching communities through skills and income, to ushering in peace and society at a national level. Education has shown its capacity to change the world, and as the globe continues to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, it remains an important way to heal the world as well.",the educationalist sarwar khawaja left once remarked that education is like the master key it unlocks almost every door around the world some of the biggest issue facing the globe have been helped through the power of education here are just some of the way in which education ha played an important role in changing the world tackling world problem issue like climate change and the covid pandemic are global problem that need global solution education ha enabled country to work together to reveal problem and to develop way to help education also help citizen across the world to become part of the solution educating u all on how we can contribute revealing and solving inequality social inequality can be difficult to discern but education allows the world to uncover and to prevent inequality leading to disadvantaged society and community for example ongoing effort to raise fund for schooling in africa tackle poverty by giving african people the tool to learn gain the skill for a career and to improve their quality of life developing nation at the same time a helping individual education can also assist the development of entire country particularly country which have weaker or developing economy education can help nation to establish the industry and expertise necessary to grow which in turn help those country to reinvest in schooling and other vital public service such a healthcare bridging divide the sentiment go that although we live on a diverse planet there is more that unites than divide u education can make this statement true by bringing community together to learn collectively there have been example of this through history particularly in the case of community where there ha previously been friction education can soothe those tension and foster better understanding fostering peace in fostering better understanding education also foster peace where there have been war and tension education can sideline conflict by focusing instead on the common issue that affect u all by teaching people around the world about way to develop grow and improve education can inhibit the potential for hostility and fighting helping the world to grow a phrase that you may have heard before is give a man a fish and you feed him for a day teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime education enables people across the planet to learn how to develop this process of empowering our own educational development mean that the whole world will grow with new idea new invention and new way to improve life adding to his description of education a a master key khawaja also explains that education can eventually eradicate the need for lock entirely opening up the world to a new sense of togetherness and openness education can change the world in many way from enriching community through skill and income to ushering in peace and society at a national level education ha shown it capacity to change the world and a the globe continues to combat the covid pandemic it remains an important way to heal the world a well,"['empowering', 'educating', 'unlocks', 'education', 'pandemic', 'educationalist', 'teaching', 'healthcare', 'enriching', 'global']"
Plymouth College of Art launches dynamic Creative Education Short Course for teachers – Education Today,"['FE colleges', 'Flexible Learning', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Pedagogy', 'Primary schools', 'Professional Development', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Secondary schools', 'Skills', 'Teaching resources', 'Training', 'Wellbeing']","January 21, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/plymouth-college-of-art-launches-dynamic-creative-education-short-course-for-teachers/,"Plymouth College of Art are already renowned for their highly sought-after creative evening classes and Short Courses, covering a wide range of subjects from calligraphy to ceramics. Now, the college has launched a new Short Course aimed at teachers, designed to give them the skills to tackle the challenges of teaching in a post-COVID world.
This newly launched Creative Education CPD course has been designed to help educators to reflect on their teaching and learn new skills that will allow them to implement small changes to their professional practice, and support their teaching in this new and uncertain world.
The global pandemic has massively impacted teaching staff, who have had little or no time to keep up with changes necessary or reflect on how to transform the landscape of teaching and learning.
Pupils’ deteriorating mental health, exam confusion, excessive workload, pressures of assessment targets and inspections, infection risks… The stressors in teaching are many and varied.
Led by Natalia Ernstman, Plymouth College of Art’s Senior Lecturer on their MA Creative Education: Making Learning, this new course, which will be delivered solely online, focuses on the belief that creativity is the route through which wider systemic challenges in education and personal resilience can be addressed.
Natalia said, “Teachers are at the front line of the pandemic in so many ways. Apart from having their own health to worry about, they are also dealing with increased feelings of anxiety and disillusionment among pupils, as well as fears and frustrations from parents. They are carrying enormous amounts of responsibility, yet it seems that they haven’t received the necessary support to be able to deal with this mental and physical burden. Nobody was prepared to deal with what Covid did to our society, but where other sectors have had more leeway to get it wrong and try again, teachers are under constant pressure to handle and solve the situation correctly and immediately. They are just expected to get on with it and make it work, because if they don’t, it’s our children’s futures that are on the line. It personally really worries me that so many teachers suffer from mental health issues as a result. It is harrowing to hear how many ambitious, enthusiastic and capable people decide that the teaching profession is too stressful for them and quit. It puts even more strain on the ones that remain, it’s desperate on so many levels.”
“At Plymouth College of Art, we don’t have the solutions to all of this, but we do know about creating safe and creative spaces where people can learn together to tackle challenging societal, professional and personal issues. That is what this short course is all about: creating a space to catch our breath, take stock and using the arts and research to design and implement small changes that support our teaching in this uncertain world. I have designed the course in a way that allows for ‘relaxed’ sharing of experiences and playful approaches to exploring where we are and where we want to go. Experts will share their view and will provide theoretical pedagogical underpinning.”
The course will also welcome guest speakers and educators to two of the sessions, one of which will be Dr Penny Hay, artist and educator, Reader in Creative Teaching and Learning, Senior Lecturer in Arts Education, Research Fellow, Centre for Cultural and Creative Industries; School of Education, Bath Spa University and Director of Research, House of Imagination (formerly 5x5x5=creativity).
The course is open to teachers in both primary and secondary education, as well as headteachers and managers in education, NQTs, and support workers. A limited number of places are available. The course will comprise of 5 online evening sessions over a period of 10 weeks. The first session will take place on 22 February 2021.

Flagship SENCO report reveals the impact of Covid-19 on pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'News', 'Research', 'SEND']","January 20, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/flagship-senco-report-reveals-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-pupils-with-special-educational-needs-and-disabilities/,"New research from Bath Spa University, in collaboration with nasen, has revealed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND), and highlights concerns around the provision of specialist support for children and young people and the impact on Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators (SENCOs).
The National SENCO Workforce Survey 2020, which this year captured the experiences of SENCOs in response to the pandemic and the first national lockdown, revealed a key issue with universal inclusive provision and differentiation of SEN support as teaching moved online for the majority of pupils, with almost three-quarters (73%) of SENCOs stating their school experienced challenges with providing virtual support for children with SEN, and 8 in 10 finding it difficult to provide differentiated learning online.
The results also reported a sharp increase in SENCOs workload as schools responded and adapted to the unprecedented situation, which saw them faced with more management tasks and paperwork, including teaching, safeguarding, completing risk assessments and quickly responding to changing national guidance – all impacting a role that was already severely lacking in time pre-pandemic.
Of those surveyed, nearly three-quarters of SENCOs (72%) felt that their schools had experienced challenges in providing support for children and young people with Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCP) during the lockdown, with over half (56.7%) finding the management of risk assessments a key challenge.
Only 1 in 10 were happy with the support they received during the pandemic, reporting that expectations and guidance changed frequently. Furthermore, nearly two-thirds (64.4%) would have welcomed more support and guidance from central government – findings that have led to recommendations around the provision of national exemplars and guidance in responding to unprecedented events in the future.
Dr Helen Curran, Senior Lecturer in Education: SEN at Bath Spa University, said: “The global pandemic has exposed the existing crisis in SEND, and amplified challenges that SENCOs already faced, such as a lack of time to execute the role.
“We know that schools have worked tirelessly to support young people during the pandemic, facing daily challenges, difficult decisions and changing national guidance. As we get to grips with a third lockdown and return to remote learning, there is a real risk that children with SEND will continue to be disproportionally impacted by the pandemic, unless teachers, SENCOs and pupils are given additional support in areas like providing appropriate and differentiated virtual learning.”
Although the research highlighted a number of challenges as a result of the pandemic, there were some positive experiences of online learning reported for some children with SEND, including a reduction in social communication and interaction anxieties.
Additionally, the majority of SENCOs (84.2%) reported an increased focus on communication with parents and families, and most SENCOs (71%) in academies were satisfied with the support from their Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs.)
Professor Adam Boddison, Chief Executive at nasen commented: “The SENCO Workforce Survey not only shines a spotlight on the strengths and challenges that impact SENCOs in their work, it also exposes some of the hidden challenges that continue to perpetuate inequalities impacting children and young people with SEND and their families.
“The pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on children and young people’s social, emotional and mental health needs, exacerbating social interaction challenges. It is vital that we support them and the mental wellbeing of our education workforce. We would like to see routine wellbeing arrangements put in place following this extended period of national challenge, including priority support for SENCOs.
“Moving forward, it is important that we work collaboratively and share good practice across mainstream, special schools and specialist settings to help all children and young people, particularly those with SEND, to learn and thrive regardless of their background or need.”

Multi Academy Trust sets out stall for next five years – Education Today,"['Academies', 'Leadership', 'News', 'Social issues']","January 18, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/multi-academy-trust-sets-out-stall-for-next-five-years/,"A fast growing multi academy trust has laid out its ambitions and priorities for the next five years, with a focus on delivering social justice and building an education system designed with the next 100 years in mind.
Wellspring Academy Trust has launched its Vision 2025 – a manifesto for developing its community of schools and associated projects as an engine for social change and improving life chances.
With its slogan, ‘We Make A Difference,’ the 25-strong school trust has clear ambitions to build on its success to date and demonstrate how multi academy trusts can operate ethically, sustainably, inclusively and effectively in the communities they serve.
Mark Wilson (right), Chief Executive at Wellspring, said: “Wellspring has grown at a tremendous rate since we began in 2013 and has firmly established its reputation for integrity, inclusive practice and our relational approach. Now is the time to take stock and look towards the future. Our Vision 2025 lays out our priorities for the next five years, covering five specific areas – People, Doing, Innovating, Assuring and Sustaining. Through strategic planning, we are committed to delivering exceptional value for the public purse and adding value that goes far beyond delivering an excellent education for all children in our care.
“One particular focus is around sustainability and long-term planning. Wellspring schools are being encouraged to develop ‘100-year plans’ and design strategies with the next 100 years in mind. Whilst this may seem far-fetched, it is only by looking far into the future that we can begin to embed the sort of long-term approach I believe we need. When previous generations set out to build the world’s most impressive cathedrals, they did so knowing they were embarking on projects that would take decades, if not centuries, to complete. We need ‘cathedral thinking’ in education and beyond.
“Other priorities include the development of our teacher training and CPD provision, the launch of community projects designed to improve environments and young people’s life chances, and a focus on wellbeing throughout the Trust.
“By outlining our vision for the next five years, I am confident that we will further cement our role as a vital part of education provision and wider community action across the north of England and beyond. We have all been through an unparalleled period in terms of its challenges, but now is the time to look forward and build the kind of society that works for all.”
In its seven years since inception, Wellspring has built eight new schools, had fourteen consecutive positive Ofsted reports, improved finances, enhanced premises and developed a number of non-profit and charitable enterprises.
Wellspring currently manages 25 schools, with that figure set to grow significantly over the next few years. It operates in mainstream primary and secondary, as well as having extensive experience in delivering special and alternative provision. Wellspring also manages a portfolio of complementary services, include mental health support services, community projects for young adults with special needs, and a host of training and consultancy services around behaviour management in schools.",a fast growing multi academy trust ha laid out it ambition and priority for the next five year with a focus on delivering social justice and building an education system designed with the next year in mind wellspring academy trust ha launched it vision a manifesto for developing it community of school and associated project a an engine for social change and improving life chance with it slogan we make a difference the strong school trust ha clear ambition to build on it success to date and demonstrate how multi academy trust can operate ethically sustainably inclusively and effectively in the community they serve mark wilson right chief executive at wellspring said wellspring ha grown at a tremendous rate since we began in and ha firmly established it reputation for integrity inclusive practice and our relational approach now is the time to take stock and look towards the future our vision lay out our priority for the next five year covering five specific area people doing innovating assuring and sustaining through strategic planning we are committed to delivering exceptional value for the public purse and adding value that go far beyond delivering an excellent education for all child in our care one particular focus is around sustainability and longterm planning wellspring school are being encouraged to develop year plan and design strategy with the next year in mind whilst this may seem farfetched it is only by looking far into the future that we can begin to embed the sort of longterm approach i believe we need when previous generation set out to build the world most impressive cathedral they did so knowing they were embarking on project that would take decade if not century to complete we need cathedral thinking in education and beyond other priority include the development of our teacher training and cpd provision the launch of community project designed to improve environment and young people life chance and a focus on wellbeing throughout the trust by outlining our vision for the next five year i am confident that we will further cement our role a a vital part of education provision and wider community action across the north of england and beyond we have all been through an unparalleled period in term of it challenge but now is the time to look forward and build the kind of society that work for all in it seven year since inception wellspring ha built eight new school had fourteen consecutive positive ofsted report improved finance enhanced premise and developed a number of nonprofit and charitable enterprise wellspring currently manages school with that figure set to grow significantly over the next few year it operates in mainstream primary and secondary a well a having extensive experience in delivering special and alternative provision wellspring also manages a portfolio of complementary service include mental health support service community project for young adult with special need and a host of training and consultancy service around behaviour management in school,"['improving', 'development', 'launched', 'future', 'decade', 'launch', 'enhanced', 'sustainability', 'new', 'innovating']"
£3m training boost for Sunderland College – Education Today,"['Digital skills', 'Engineering', 'FE colleges', 'News', 'Science', 'SEND', 'Skills', 'T levels']","January 15, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/3m-training-boost-for-sunderland-college/,"World-class facilities that will deliver ‘unparalleled learning opportunities’ for North East students are set to move forward, after a successful £3m bid to Government.
Sunderland College will be rolling out prestigious new T Levels from a new cutting-edge immersive environment, after the Government confirmed it will fund the transformation of a space within its Bede Campus. The 1920s Bede Building (pictured left) will see its old hall undergo a complete refurbishment, with the inclusion of a sophisticated, 360 degree immersive visualisation ‘dome’ created within it, that will allow students to train in a number of virtual reality environments.
The dome, a fully integrated immersive solution, will create virtual realities for students studying in several technical disciplines. The major refurbishment will also include the creation of an amphitheatre-style seated area, and a number of innovation suites and flexible spaces for employer led training.
North East firm Malcolm Hollis has been appointed to oversee the major development and a construction partner Engie has been has been appointed to deliver the designs – which were developed by North East architect, Seymour Architecture. Work will commence in January and will be completed in October 2021.
Ellen Thinnesen (pictured right), chief executive of Education Partnership North East, which includes Sunderland College, said: “I am absolutely thrilled that we have secured funding to develop what will become a leading technical skills and digital innovation centre. The centre will be game changer for our college and most importantly for young people and employers from across our region.
“Bede is a stunning campus, that has already benefitted from major capital investment over the last few years to ensure that, behind its beautiful red brick façade, we’re able to offer first-class educational experiences. . This latest investment will raise the bar yet again, and the plans we have for the new centre will position us right at the cutting-edge of education. The new centre will be a fantastic regional asset that will ensure our T Level provision is exceptional and we are able to increasingly deliver a valuable pipeline of students to meet regional skills shortages.”
The new centre will allow the college to develop student’s knowledge, understanding and skills in a shared VR facility offering flexible applications for all T Level disciplines – for instance, health students might learn CPR in a simulated football stadium, where the sights, sounds and reality of an emergency response situation are recreated by digital 360 degree technology, a learning environment radically different to the confines of a traditional classroom. Similarly, T level students studying construction will be able to shape the way a health and safety worksite scenario unfolds in response to their decisions. And supported by the college’s technical team, employers will be able to recreate their manufacturing plants within the centre using 360 degree immersive technology for training of existing or future employees.
Sunderland College will begin delivery of its new T Level provision from the new centre from September 2021. T Levels will offer a new and unique curriculum, which will include employer led education and technical training for students, within industries such as construction, digital, health, science and education.
As well as exceptional facilities, the college will ensure its offer is anchored by close links to employers, and will shortly be announcing new strategic partnerships to support the development of the digital innovation centre as a vibrant business hub ensuring employers are at the heart of the next generation of talent.
“We want this facility to be a collaborative space, where businesses co-design and co-deliver education to ensure that we maximise the value of this space. We’ll be working with partners from a range of industries to simulate their working environments, and ensure every T Level student leaves us with unmatched theoretical knowledge, and authentically developed skills enabling through digital technologies, meaningful employer partnerships and industry placements”.
“We’re a future-focused college, and this new centre will absolutely exemplify that – it’s a place where education and business will converge.”
As well as being an innovative centre for T Level training, the college will open a small sensory environment within the centre where T Level students will gain real work experience supporting the delivery of digitally informed immersive therapies for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).
Ellen added: “This will be a truly life-changing space for children and young people with SEND, and we are determined that the centre will deliver maximum advantage to people from across the city of Sunderland and wider region.”",worldclass facility that will deliver unparalleled learning opportunity for north east student are set to move forward after a successful m bid to government sunderland

National Marine Aquarium introduces online lessons for school children – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'Educational event', 'Environmental Focus', 'News', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","January 13, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/national-marine-aquarium-introduces-online-lessons-for-school-children/,"The National Marine Aquarium, an initiative of the Ocean Conservation Trust, will provide the background for the broadcasting of an exciting series of free, live lessons. The live lessons will assist with home learning whilst also providing a chance for children and their parents and teachers to gain some of the wellbeing benefits that have been proven to come from watching aquatic life.
Every Friday during lockdown, viewers will be able to tune in to two special shows on the aquarium’s YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/user/NMAPlymouth
The first, ‘Deep Science’ (1:00pm – 1:20pm) will see the Aquarium’s own Schools Team using aquarium exhibits and lab facilities to explore the science behind the animated ocean exploration tv series ‘The Deep’ (CBBC @12pm on weekdays during lockdown). Expect fascinating facts and real time experiments, as well as ideas to follow up with at home.
Key themes for each week are as follows:

15th Jan – Underwater Volcanoes
22nd Jan – Creature Classification
29th Jan – Nautical Navigation
5th Feb – Ocean Mysteries
12th Feb – Megafauna
19th Feb – Life Cycles
26th Feb – Looking after the Ocean

‘Mermaid Tales’ will air from 1:30 – 1:45pm and will involve a short story narrated by the Aquarium’s resident mermaid, Marina – perfect timing before an afternoon nap, or as a gentle, relaxing start to the afternoon.
Stu Higgs, Schools Programme Manager for the Ocean Conservation Trust, said: “With the news of further school closures hitting the headlines in the New Year we wanted to make sure we were doing our bit to support the thousands of students and teachers who visit us at the Aquarium every year.
“Research has shown that encounters with marine environments (physical or virtual) have a powerful effect on our emotional state and general wellbeing, and with the country in lockdown there has never been a more important time to ensure everyone has access to a weekly dose of ocean. That’s why we’re launching our new live lesson series on YouTube starting this Friday the 15th!
“Whether you’re looking for something to round your week off with a bang, or help you wind down for the weekend, our new YouTube live lessons series should hit the spot”.
The content of the lessons will also help children to feel part of the start of the global UN Decade of Ocean Science for sustainable development.
Nicola Bridge, Head of Conservation Education and Communications for the charity, said: “Despite the continued Covid-related restrictions we are all under, our suite of accessible online resources will help those home schooling get access to valuable resources and interactive activities.
“The UK is a national and global leader in marine science, and we feel Ocean related teaching should therefore be an essential part of the core curriculum offering and want to help facilitate that.  We also want to support parents and teachers in this difficult time for everyone.
“The Ocean provides half of the oxygen we breathe, drives the weather and climate and is a valuable food source for much of the world, and to look after it for future generations, we need to create an Ocean literate generation – that is to say, a generation that understands the ways in which we are all inextricably connected to it, just as it is to us.”
In 2020 the Ocean Conservation Trust also launched virtual tours of the Aquarium and downloadable lessons for schools, which teachers can incorporate into their home learning plans for students of all ages. These sessions have been updated to include capacity for up to 100 home-based students to connect to and participate in simultaneously in response to the school closures announced at the start of the year.

Discovery Education gives primary schools no cost access to new RHE curriculum resources – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'KS1', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Resources', 'RHE', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","January 12, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/discovery-education-gives-primary-schools-free-access-to-new-rhe-curriculum-resources/,"A digital programme which provides complete coverage of the new RHE curriculum is being made available at no cost to UK primary schools, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
From 12th January, Discovery Education is providing free access to ‘Health and Relationships’, a complete suite of dynamic digital resources which helps teachers to plan, deliver and evidence the new DfE objectives. The resources can be accessed in the classroom and at home, helping schools to support learning wherever it is taking place.
From April 2021 UK primary schools must deliver new teaching of relationships education, physical health and mental wellbeing. But, in a challenging year, many teachers have had little time to prepare. Discovery Education is responding to this by providing schools with open access to a complete RHE teaching and learning solution.
“We know that this is a difficult time for schools and that teachers might not be ready for the RHE curriculum changes”, said Howard Lewis, UK Managing Director of Discovery Education UK. “That’s why we’re providing free access to our popular Health and Relationships programme, which includes fully-resourced lessons and teacher support. We’re proud to help UK primary schools by opening up this exciting scheme of work.”
Sam Winton, Deputy Headteacher at St Margaret’s CE Primary School in Crawley, is already using Discovery Education Health and Relationships. “Discovery Education Health and Relationships is our go-to resource for RHE”, explains Sam. “When we first reviewed the statutory guidance, we realised that it covered a lot of new ground. We wanted a complete scheme of work that teachers could pick up and run with. Health and Relationships has saved us huge amounts of time and is brilliant to teach. The resources and support have given us confidence to approach challenging topics and our pupils are very engaged.”
Newland House School in Twickenham is using Health and Relationships to teach PSHE remotely, as teacher Andrea Taylor explains: “Returning to school after the first lockdown early last autumn, we used the Health and Relationships programme to supplement our Recovery Curriculum. This was useful not only for children but for teachers as well, providing resources to help us explore and address any concerns or anxieties about the return to school. In periods of home learning the platform has also proved ideal. Integrating PSHE lessons into the remote timetable is very simple and the resources work equally well as both live online lessons and static resources, which the children can easily access from home.”
Discovery Education Health and Relationships will be freely available to UK primary schools until 31st October 2021. Suitable for children in years 1 to 6, the programme will enable teachers to show that they are meeting the new DfE objectives and deliver lessons with confidence.
Devised by subject experts, the programme’s resources are engaging and age-appropriate. Child-led scenario-based videos feature children talking about key topics while role play activities help pupils explore scenarios and develop skills to confidently deal with issues that affect their lives today and as they grow.
Discovery Education Health and Relationships covers 6 key topic areas: Healthy and Happy Friendships, Similarities and Differences, Caring and Responsibility, Families and Committed Relationships, Healthy Bodies, Healthy Minds and Coping with Change. Designed as a spiral curriculum, the programme enables pupils to revisit each topic as they progress through primary school, building upon their skills and understanding.
Many of the topics covered e.g. feelings of loneliness, isolation and loss and coping with change, have special relevance to the current pandemic and the challenges children face. The programme’s digital content means that teachers can easily pick up activities for children to complete at home to help them cope with the uncertainty of the situation and share positive thoughts and ideas with classmates.
Support for teachers includes end-to-end curriculum planning, detailed guidance and help with parental communication. The programme also sets out a series of best practice principles to help schools create a safe learning environment for teaching about healthy relationships.
The programme’s series editor is Lucy Marcovitch, a PSHE subject expert and former National Curriculum advisor. Lucy said: “The challenges of COVID-19 mean that many schools simply haven’t had time to get ready to teach a subject which needs to be planned very carefully and delivered safely. Discovery Education Health and Relationships takes care of this. Teachers can feel reassured that they are fully prepared while children can benefit from high-quality, inclusive resources to help them lead healthy and fulfilling lives.”
Primary schools are encouraged to register for free access at www.discoveryeducation.co.uk/rse. Free access will be provided until 31st October 2021.

"Support available from Twinkl for teachers, parents and carers during lockdown – Education Today","['Coronavirus', 'News', 'Resources', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","January 11, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/support-available-from-twinkl-for-teachers-parents-and-carers-during-lockdown/,"Twinkl, an online publisher used by schools, teachers and parents across the UK has brought together a range of free educational tools to support schools and families with home learning during the new and continued lockdown periods.
This includes a Home Learning Hub, specially created for parents, which has daily activities for ages 3-11. The hub offers a range of resources including worksheets, crafts and educational games, as well as guides for parents to help them navigate the curriculum.
The company is also providing free access to Twinkl Go!, a range of interactive and audiovisual resources suitable for all ages and covering all subjects. This collection offers hundreds of games, videos, audiobooks and activities, which can be completed on any device.
Twinkl also has a collection of free partnership resources available with interactive video content to make digital learning engaging and fun, including materials with Go Jetters, Numberblocks, Guinness World Records, BBC Teach Live Lessons, David Attenborough and Puffin books.
The educational tools are designed to support educators with online teaching and the challenges this brings, as well as to equip parents and carers with the materials they need to further support learning.
Jonathan Seaton, Co-founder and CEO of Twinkl, said: “We have brought together the tools and resources that we think are the most helpful and practical for home learning and enable people to choose what will work best for them. We have been listening to and speaking with teaching staff, parents and carers to understand their needs and what will support them as they pick up home learning once again.
“It is incredible what people across the country are doing to support their pupils and children and we hope they recognise this as well as seek any support they need, whatever form this takes.”
Alongside resources and tools for parents, Twinkl has also made a free planner tool for teachers that can be used to collate materials and share lessons at home. By sending a link to the lesson, parents and carers can access and download the materials directly, without needing any form of Twinkl membership.
To get access to the resources on the Home Learning Hub or Twinkl Go!, individuals need to create a free log-in using an email address and password. No payment information is taken when creating a free account and there is no obligation to use Twinkl after the help is no longer needed.
Committed to helping with more than just educational tools, Twinkl has also partnered with the campaign ‘Our Frontline’ to bring together mental health support and advice for teaching staff. The team at Twinkl recognise the challenges and pressures educators have been facing in recent months and want educators to know that ‘It’s ok not to feel ok’ as they continue to support pupils during the pandemic. Set up by Samaritans, Mind, Shout85258 and Hospice UK, with the support of The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, ‘Our Frontline’ provides free round the clock, 1-2-1 support and online mental health and bereavement resources available here.
“Schools and teaching staff are under intense pressure and so it’s vital that they are supported in their health and wellbeing”, added Jonathan. “We want people to know that it is ok to ask for help with this, that they aren’t alone and that there are places they can reach out and speak to someone.”
The materials available range from activity sheets, information packs and interactive presentations to online educational games and videos, with over 40,000 of these available for free. These cover all core subjects for all ages and include resources mapped to a range of curriculums.

BESA announces free support for teachers during national lockdown – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'CPD', 'Digital learning', 'News', 'Professional Development', 'Resources', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","January 8, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/besa-announces-free-support-for-teachers-during-national-lockdown/,"As schools close their doors to the majority of pupils for the second time, The British Educational Suppliers Association (BESA), has put together a range of support measures to help teachers deliver remote learning.
Caroline Wright, Director General of BESA said: “During the first national lockdown BESA members provided over £30m of free support and resources to schools. We don’t expect that our members will be able to offer the same level of free support this time around, so we are directing schools to three initiatives that will help them identify the products and services for remote learning that are recommended by their peers, so that they can put in place the measures they need as quickly as possible.”
Firstly, the LendED platform is an online tool offering teachers the opportunity to search, select and trial education technology resources for free, to determine their suitability before committing to purchase. As additional support, BESA have worked with their member companies to offer a wide range of additional resources that are specifically designed to support home learning. LendED has the full support of the Department for Education and was included in their list of recommended remote learning tools. All resources on the LendED platform have been provided by BESA members, trusted suppliers who have signed up to the BESA Code of Practice, so schools can be confident in their quality and service.
BESA has also released access to video recordings of the recent LearnED Online CPD event, which took place in November. LearnED brings together teachers from around the regions to share best practice and deliver peer to peer learning. The November edition focused on the challenges of delivering remote learning and featured case studies and panel discussions which highlight those schools and teachers who have managed the process well, and offers support for any educator looking for guidance. The videos can be accessed for free via LearnED.org.uk
In August BESA published a report on Learning after Lockdown that featured school case studies on the products and services that they had found useful during the first lockdown, and signposted additional measures that schools might want to consider as they started the new academic year. The lessons learned the first time around serve as a good signpost for any school looking for a starting point, and covers key areas such as blended learning, mental health, safeguarding and wellbeing.

Food for Life offers lockdown learning support for schools and parents with FREE membership – Education Today,"['Catering & Nutrition', 'Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'Environmental Focus', 'News', 'Resources', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","January 7, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/food-for-life-offers-lockdown-learning-support-for-schools-and-parents-with-free-membership/,"Following the announcement of a third national lockdown, the biggest national school healthy eating programme, Food for Life, is offering free membership to schools during lockdown and through until the Easter holidays. The primary aim is to support schools, parents and carers to effectively continue good food and growing education, particularly during this period of additional disruption during lockdown.
Food for Life supports schools to get pupils eating healthy food and reconnect them with where their food comes from.  The ongoing pandemic has highlighted that now, more than ever, good health is key, and food has a crucial role to play. Food for Life strives to support schools in their good food and growing learning, encouraging positive food and health attitudes for life.
Independent studies report that joining Food for Life has increased school meal take up, attendance, increased confidence of staff and enriched their school curriculum. It could also help schools meet Ofsted criteria.
Primary schools across the UK will now have free access to a range of curriculum tools and materials, including Jamie Oliver Kitchen Garden Project resources, designed by experts to get children cooking, growing and eating amazing food that’s good for the planet too. These resources can be shared with parents who are home educating and will benefit children of key workers who are still attending school.
Sophia Koniarska, Associate Director at Food for Life says “The latest lockdown and subsequent closure of schools has hit at a time when energy and resource are low. We have heard some truly inspirational stories of teachers using innovative methods to teach safely with reduced numbers, whilst also supporting pupils learning with their families at home.
“Here at Food for Life we are keen to support teachers and home learning to incorporate good food education as much as possible. Never has it been more important for our younger generation to have an understanding of good food and where it comes from, embedding positive health habits and food enjoyment for life.  We of course look forward to continue our support in classrooms and school dining rooms once lockdown has lifted.”
Schools who register for free membership will receive:

Online access to Food for Life and Jamie Oliver Kitchen Garden Project resources

Qualcomm Incorporated announces support for first ever virtual IET FIRST® LEGO® LEAGUE Cambridge tournament – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'Engineering', 'KS2', 'KS3', 'KS4', 'News', 'STEM']","January 4, 2021",https://www.education-today.co.uk/qualcomm-incorporated-announces-support-for-first-ever-virtual-iet-first-lego-league-cambridge-tournament/,"The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) FIRST® LEGO® League Challenge, a global science and technology tournament for 9 – 16 year olds, is returning to Cambridge in 2021 and is welcoming applications from teams across the region. Now in its fourth year, the Cambridge tournament is funded by Qualcomm Incorporated, including the provision of robotics equipment and sponsored places to 12 teams from deprived areas across the county, enabling them to take part in the exciting robotics competition.
For the first time ever, the tournament will be hosted virtually and tournament hosts – Qualcomm Technologies International Ltd., the Department of Engineering and Conscious Communications – and the IET are busy innovating the process to find new ways to make the tournament as engaging and fun as the usual physical event format. As always, the involvement of the children and teams taking part is of top priority, therefore to help teams as they prepare for the tournament, the IET has also developed a rigorous guide for team coaches to enable them to deliver the coaching sessions safely and effectively.
Set to take place on Tuesday 23 March, the STEM tournament will see 25 teams from across Cambridgeshire compete for the chance to progress to the national final in July 2021. The IET FIRST® LEGO® League Challenge is a global initiative, with over 67,000 teams getting involved across 110 countries every year. From now until their tournament dates, teams of up to 10 young people will be working with their team coaches to prepare for the Challenge.
The theme of this year’s FIRST® LEGO® League Challenge is RePLAY, which is based around the importance of play and being more active. Students are challenged to develop a number of key technology and life-based skills through the four components of FIRST® LEGO® League Challenge: the Robot Game, Robot Design, Core Values and the Innovation Project.
For the Robot Game, teams are required to put their teamwork and creativity to the test as they design and programme a LEGO® MINDSTORMS® or SPIKE Prime robot to complete 15 missions on a unique LEGO® challenge mat.
The Robot Design aspect of the challenge involves teams presenting their robots to the judges and explaining their design process for building the robot and the code they have written to programme it.
The FIRST® signature set of Core Values lie at the heart of the competition; teams are required to demonstrate these values throughout all aspects of the competition. They are: Inclusion, Discovery, Teamwork, Innovation, Fun and Impact.
For the Innovation Project, teams must identify a problem connected to the annual theme, RePLAY, come up with a solution and then present their ideas to the judges at the tournament. This year, for example, teams could provide a solution to the challenge of ensuring more people in the community are keeping fit and active.
James Chapman, VP & GM, Voice/Music/Wearables Qualcomm Technologies International, Ltd., comments: “The power of education and equal opportunity is incredibly important and we are enormously proud to sponsor the IET FIRST® LEGO® League Challenge in Cambridge for the fourth year running. Getting an experience of programming, in a friendly but competitive environment, is a unique opportunity for many young people. As well as the STEM skills that young people develop through the Challenge, every year we have been impressed by the collaboration, innovation and sportsmanship demonstrated by the teams involved as these are all skills needed for the world of work.”
Lowri Walton, IET Education Manager – FIRST® LEGO® League, said: “During these uncertain and challenging times, we are committed more than ever to delivering the life-changing experiences that FIRST® LEGO® League offers to young people. Education has taken a real hit this year due to the pandemic and we are determined that this Challenge will not be disrupted too. At the IET, the safety of our teams, volunteers, and staff members is the top priority. Although slightly different to previous tournaments, I am confident that this year will be just as enjoyable, successful and rewarding for everybody involved.”

Teachers and parents invited to have their say on EAL research topics – Education Today,"['EAL', 'English', 'News', 'Research']","December 18, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/teachers-and-parents-invited-to-have-their-say-on-eal-research-topics/,"Researchers at Oxford University are inviting teachers, parents and students to help set priorities for research into English as an Additional Language (EAL).
The team is looking for ‘unanswered questions’ about EAL that can be investigated for the benefit of those who teach and study it.
The project, known as a priority-setting partnership, will gather suggestions from a broad group of participants before creating a ‘top ten’ of EAL research topics that will be made available to the academic community.
Questions could be related to classroom practice, such as ‘What is the best way to teach the finer points of English grammar to advanced EAL learners?’, or ‘How can I help “new to English” students understand the content of my geography lessons?’
They could be related to parental support of EAL learners at home, such as ‘What are the effects of reading bilingual story books with my child on their literacy development in English?’, or ‘How can I help my child with their homework if I am not confident with my own use of English?’
Or they could be related to what EAL learners can do to support their own learning, such as ‘When I take notes in class does it matter if I use my home language?’, or ‘Are some ways of practising new words that I have learned more effective than other ways?’
Project organiser Dr Hamish Chalmers, of Oxford University’s Department of Education, said: ‘People who do research are not usually the people who use research. It’s important, therefore, that the people who use research tell the people who do research what kinds of questions they think those researchers should try to answer. That way, our research will be as meaningful and impactful as possible. We are working with teachers, parents of EAL learners, and EAL learners themselves to identify the most pressing questions in the field.’
A steering committee consisting of teachers, parents and EAL learners has been formed to oversee the priority-setting partnership (PSP). They have created a survey inviting teachers, parents and students to contribute their questions to the PSP. The team is keen to spread the word about the survey and the PSP so that organisers can hear as many voices as possible.
The survey is open until the end of January 2021, at which point all the questions and comments will be analysed by researchers at Oxford University. They will look carefully at what everybody has said in the survey, create themes from the information gathered, and turn those into a list of questions that could be answer through research.
Dr Chalmers said: ‘Themes that arise during priority setting will be turned into specific research questions for researchers to explore. For example, in the survey people might say things like “I want to know what the best way to teach vocabulary to my EAL learners is”, or “I find it difficult to remember new English words and I am not sure how best to solve this”, or “My son uses an iPhone app to learn English words – does this help him?”
‘All of these thoughts can be combined into a research question like “What approaches to teaching English vocabulary have been shown to be effective?”’
After the research questions have been created, they will be organised into a new ‘ranking survey’ that will ask participants to rank the research questions by importance. Finally, a workshop will be convened to allow participants to explore the ranked list of questions and decide together which of them should be in a ‘top ten’ of unanswered EAL research questions.
The top ten will be published in magazines and journals, publicised at conferences and seminars, and sent to researchers in EAL and to people who fund their research so that new research in EAL can be informed by what matters to EAL research users.
Speaking to teachers, parents and EAL learners, Professor Victoria Murphy, Deputy Director of the Department of Education at Oxford University, said: ‘Please let us know what you think, so we can get a good response to what research is maximally of interest to teachers, parents and EAL students. Public engagement in research in this way helps to ensure that the research we do is meaningful, relevant, and that it meets the stated needs of the people whose practice it is intended to benefit.’

New astronomy project to benefit thousands of school children – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'Engineering', 'Maths', 'News', 'Science', 'Space!', 'STEM']","December 17, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-astronomy-project-to-benefit-thousands-of-school-children/,"The restoration of an historical telescope will form the centrepiece of a project to inspire thousands of school children to reach for the stars and pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM).
Kielder Observatory, set in the beautiful Kielder Water and Forest Park, in Northumberland, has secured a grant from the Reece Foundation to help restore an original Herschel telescope at Newcastle University to full working order. It will use the restoration to inspire thousands of school children, with an initial pilot of its programme, From STEM to Stars, at schools across Northumberland and Sunderland in the WISE Academies Trust.
The telescope will be at the centre of a project to create Kielder Observatory Star Groups – groups of school children who will study the restoration of the telescope to learn about the science and engineering skills involved while learning more about the night sky from the observatory’s team of professional astronomers.
The team will be visiting schools for activities and children will also be visiting the site, which sits under the finest dark skies in Europe. Star group members will have the opportunity to become Kielder Observatory Ambassadors and have work placements at space companies in the North East.
Catherine Johns, CEO of Kielder Observatory, said: “Herschel is a familiar name in the North East. Both William and Caroline Herschel were hugely influential in the study of astronomy and to be able to restore a telescope that William Herschel himself perhaps used is very exciting. This project is part of our developing strategy to reach beyond the observatory site and connect with people in innovative ways to convey that special moment of Kielder inspiration.
“The project will enable children to work with expert businesspeople and academics in the North East, helping them make a direct link between STEM subjects at school and STEM career opportunities in the North East.”
Zoe Carr, OBE, CEO of the WISE Academies Trust said: “We’re delighted to be the first schools to be involved in this exciting project. It’s important for our pupils to learn about their rich, scientific heritage and the great innovation that has been achieved here in the North-East. This project not only looks to the past but will also inspire pupils to see the possibilities that lay before them through the exploration of careers in engineering and STEM subjects.”
Anne Reece, chairwoman of the Reece Foundation said: “The Reece Foundation is delighted to support this project which brings the Kielder Observatory facilities to schools and children in the region – and links this to one story from the region’s rich history of innovation and scientific discovery.
“The opportunity to see the stars and planets alongside the chance to restore such a historically significant object as the Herschel telescope is one not to be missed. We are sure this will be both inspiring to the new generation of engineers and scientists that the region and the world so desperately need – and also a lot of fun.”
Dr Angela Dyson, director of physics at Newcastle University, said: “We’re really excited to be part of this project. Alexander Herschel was the founding professor of physics at Newcastle in 1871. His father John, grandfather William and great aunt Caroline were all eminent astronomers. Restoring the telescope has been an ambition of ours for quite some time. This project provides a unique platform to inspire and enthuse the next generation of engineers, physicists and astronomers.”
The new project comes as Kielder has recently received planning permission to site a new five metre diameter Spider 500 radio telescope, known as the Tanlaw telescope, which will allow it to contribute to worldwide scientific research, attract university research into Northumberland and develop its remote outreach activities, particularly in schools. The observatory has already announced the development of an augmented reality Kielder Observatory, allowing people to view a virtual nighttime sky, and is developing an online Kielder learning resource, with many more initiatives on the horizon.
The observatory, which attracts around 20,000 visitors per year, has a team of astronomers, guest speakers and volunteers who discuss and make observations about the Universe through a series of public events.
Located just a few miles from the Scottish border, high upon Black Fell, the site for Kielder Observatory was chosen as one of the locations in the UK which has the least amount of light pollution. It is one of just two observatories in England which are in protected dark sky areas, as certified by the International Dark Sky Association. The observatory started as part of Kielder Art and Architecture, a sustained programme of large-scale art installations around Kielder Water and Forest.

"Invest in teachers to secure long-term prosperity, says Institute of Physics – Education Today","['CPD', 'News', 'Pedagogy']","December 16, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/invest-in-teachers-to-secure-long-term-prosperity-says-institute-of-physics/,"The Institute of Physics (IOP) is calling on policy makers across the UK to level up student learning outcomes by backing a new subject-specific programme of support for teachers.
In a report published today, the IOP is urging governments across the UK to commit to establishing an entitlement for teachers which ensures at least half of their professional learning is subject-specific. The report, Subjects Matter, says this change would raise student academic outcomes, and ultimately economic prosperity, through increases in UK workforce productivity.
Governments can seize this opportunity, IOP recommends, by building a world-class system of subject-specific CPD to ensure that all teachers are able to improve their subject knowledge throughout their careers. Such a system would provide all students, in all schools, with access to high-quality subject teaching. This would increase the number of well-educated students and consequentially increase overall UK economic productivity, the IOP says. It would also reduce the current disparity of academic performance between UK regions, presenting government officials with a high-value opportunity to continue building on the ‘levelling up’ agenda. The additional investment would represent about 1% of the salary budget.
Jonathan Flint CBE, IOP President and a former managing director at BAE Systems, commented on the pressing business case to invest in teachers: “Great teachers inspire the best outcomes in their students, whatever their subject. They are key to the UK’s future prosperity, and this proposal to raise teaching standards is an opportunity we must seize as soon as possible.
“Governments across the UK have a real chance here, to improve student outcomes over the long term while also tackling the economic emergency posed by the pandemic. By investing in the teaching workforce of today, we can better equip more students with the knowledge, understanding and abilities that will fuel the industries of tomorrow. Now is our opportunity to act, particularly given the UK already has a critical skills deficit, serious teacher recruitment and retention challenges, and ingrained inequality.
“This is the time to be investing in great teachers – giving them the tools and support they need to help students to realise their full potential. If the UK is to fulfil its ambition of becoming a research and innovation-driven knowledge-based economy by the end of decade, UK PLC will need to see this kind of investment in the teaching workforce in the next Comprehensive Spending Review.”
Pointing to a wealth of evidence, the Subjects Matter report states that – in terms of improved attainment and progression rates – teaching quality has been shown to be the single most important school-related factor in determining student outcomes. It also has a larger influence than class size or teacher salaries. Unlike other professions such as doctors and lawyers, however, there is currently no UK-wide requirement for teachers to develop knowledge of their specialist subject through accredited CPD after they qualify at the start of their careers.
According to the 2018 Department for Education Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), fewer than 50% of teachers in England had participated in curriculum-related CPD in the twelve months prior to the survey, compared to almost 90% of teachers in Shanghai and 80% of teachers in Singapore.
In addition, the survey found teachers in England engaged in less CPD overall than in most other high performing countries, and were less likely to engage in subject-specific CPD. Further DfE data shows that CPD expenditure varies hugely between schools and local authorities, with the highest expenditure-per-student in England being nearly ten times greater than the lowest.
Emily Perry, Professor of Education at Sheffield Institute of Education, Sheffield Hallam University welcomed the publication of the Subjects Matter report, saying: “There is a strong body of evidence which shows that many teachers lack access to high quality CPD. Therefore, I welcome this report from the Institute of Physics, which draws together the evidence to propose constructive, achievable ways in which the UK governments can improve the quality and provision of teacher CPD.
“It’s very helpful to see how teachers can be better supported to engage in subject specific CPD, through changes in the culture, provision and its quality. The IOP has provided recommendations that will result in all teachers gaining access to high quality support to improve their subject and pedagogical expertise, thereby increasing their retention in the profession and improving the educational outcomes of children and young people.”

The Scottish Football Association launches “Learning Through Football” initiative – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'Literacy', 'Maths', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Scotland', 'Teaching resources']","December 15, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-scottish-football-association-launches-learning-through-football-initiative/,"Scotland head coach Steve Clarke and penalty-save hero David Marshall have given their backing to a new initiative which will enable thousands of children across the country to add Scotland’s UEFA EURO 2020 adventure to their studies. Learning Through Football, a classroom-based teaching resource, was launched at Miller Primary School in Castlemilk and is designed to use the power of football to improve literacy and numeracy.
The programme has been developed in line with the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) and includes more than 40 activities centred around the UEFA European Championship for teachers to download and deliver after the Christmas holidays.
Building on the excitement of the Scotland Men’s National Team qualification for the first major tournament in 22 years, Learning Through Football will launch in Glasgow – with Hampden Park one of 12 host city venues for the 60th anniversary of the UEFA European Championship – and will be rolled-out across the country as excitement builds.
Pupils taking part will get an exclusive insight into the world of the Scotland National Team and the broader football industry, tailored to literacy and numeracy outcomes: from the stats behind the successes of captain Andy Robertson and goalkeeping hero David Marshall; presenting like STV’s Sheelagh MacLaren; to trying-out the art of commentary made famous by BBC Scotland’s Liam McLeod and Sky Sports’ Ian Crocker.
Steve Clarke, Scotland Head Coach: “It is important that football, as our national sport, is back on the national curriculum and it’s encouraging that the whole country can share in what the Scotland National Team has achieved, especially the next generation of young people we want to inspire. Whether it’s playing the game or being involved in the many jobs around football, Learning Through Football is a great initiative that will allow young people to learn all about the EUROS in anticipation of Scotland taking part and especially with Hampden Park being one of the host venues.”
David Marshall, Scotland goalkeeper: “It’s great to see that qualifying for a major tournament is already having a positive influence on young people through the school curriculum. Learning Through Football is a terrific initiative and one I wished was available in the classroom when I was that age.
“In a way it makes you realise the importance of what we have achieved and hopefully it inspires kids across the country to interact with football in a way that will help their education but also their careers with the possibilities that now exist in and around the game.”
Based on the established ‘inter-disciplinary learning’ model, the tool has been developed in conjunction with Glasgow’s Physical Education, Physical Activity and School Sport (PEPASS) team and Glasgow City Council Education Services.
Miller Primary School in Glasgow is one of the schools already using the tool in class, with pupils trying a range of new activities from designing football strips to making their own national anthem for the tournament. Two pupils have also re-enacted the Head Coach’s post-match interview after Scotland qualified in a dramatic penalty shootout against Serbia in Belgrade.
Jacqueline Church, Principal Teacher at Miller Primary School: “We’ve thoroughly enjoyed bringing the Learning Through Football tool into the classroom. Everyone loves their football at Miller Primary and the activities are really flexible and allow the children to explore their own interests in the sports industry. Not only are the assignments fun and interesting, but the children are able apply a range of skills to meaningful life contexts, boosting their confidence and leadership skills.
“By exploring jobs within the industry, they are also recognising the teamwork, communication and perseverance skills we need to work in any job, which sets them in good stead for the future.”
David Weir, PE Lead Officer at PEPASS, said: “It’s been a pleasure working with the UEFA EURO 2020 Glasgow team and the Scottish FA over the past couple of years to develop this extremely valuable teaching and learning tool.
“The commitment to detail and desire to create an educational resource which not only acknowledges and references many aspects of Curriculum for Excellence but specifically delivers a relevant, coherent, challenging, enjoyable and lasting tool for all, was particularly appealing.
“We will all be celebrating when Scotland run onto the pitch for their first game at Hampden, none more so than our young people, and this tool will really help them feel part of it.”
The tool is accessed through a newly launched area of the UEFA EURO 2020 website, which will give primary and secondary teachers easy access to the resources needed to deliver in schools.
This new digital format of the inter-disciplinary learning tool allows teachers to see the cross-curricular links between project ideas, showing the wealth of learning areas that football can be part of. Alongside learning topics, there are a number of projects and assignments aligned to Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) learning outcomes in literacy, expressive arts, health and wellbeing, maths and numeracy, science, social studies and technologies.
Each curriculum area can be downloaded as a handy summary, as well as the whole snapshot of the curriculum and related project ideas. There is a guidance note for further information.
Teachers are being asked to use, share and feedback on experiences with these resources, as the Scottish FA and partners continue to develop the project.

Nearly three quarters of educators lack confidence that students are learning at home – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'News', 'Research']","December 11, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/nearly-three-quarters-of-educators-lack-confidence-that-students-are-learning-at-home/,"Educators up and down the UK have experienced a sustained period of unpredictably this year, which looks set to continue into the spring at the very earliest. The pandemic is something that nobody could have been prepared for and the speed of change meant that many schools were required to develop remote learning strategies in minimal time.
Despite the continued adaptability and resilience shown by educators, the Naace COVID-19 Education Impact Report has highlighted that 72 percent of educators surveyed are not confident that their students are learning. Educator feedback suggests that while technology has been instrumental in the delivery of remote learning, student engagement is a cause for concern.
The Naace COVID-19 Education Impact Report surveyed over 1,000 educators from around the UK, looking to provide an insight into educator opinions on teaching and learning during the pandemic.
Some of the report findings include:

62 percent of educators surveyed believe no more than 60 percent of students are engaged in home/remote learning.
There is a mixed outlook on communication with students, 33 percent agreeing it has been easy, in comparison with 36 percent who disagree.
79 percent of educators strongly agree they are confident using their edtech skills to support home learners.
Only 28 percent of educators surveyed agree their mental health has not been affected.

Philip Blackburn, Chair of Naace, said: “Being embedded in the education community, Naace has seen first-hand how the pandemic has had such a significant impact on teaching and learning. We hope schools will use the findings of the report to start conversations about how edtech strategies can be strengthened as we move through a challenging winter.
“We would urge schools to take advantage of the fantastic resources and learning opportunities that exist in the education sector.

More than 50 schools across North Nottinghamshire receive donated Christmas trees – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News']","December 9, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/more-than-50-schools-across-north-nottinghamshire-receive-donated-christmas-trees/,"More than 50 schools across North Nottinghamshire are getting into the festive spirit early this year by claiming a free locally grown Christmas tree, thanks to an initiative from North Notts BID.
The trees – which have been provided by the Retford and Gainsborough Garden Centre – were available to all schools in the area, with 52 taking up the offer.
The response to the initiative this year has been overwhelmingly positive, with four times as many schools requesting trees than last year.
Sally Gillborn, chief executive of North Notts BID, said: “We introduced this initiative for the first time in 2019, and the take-up this year has been overwhelming. When we first spoke with Retford and Gainsborough Garden Centre about working together on this, we anticipated around 15 or 20 schools being involved, so to have more than doubled that number is amazing.”
Not only does this initiative aim to bring Christmas cheer to local schools around the region, it also helps to support Retford and Gainsborough Garden Centre, which has welcomed the BID’s custom.
Sally continued: “2020 has been a tough year for many communities across North Nottinghamshire, and we are committed to continuing to support those that need help to ensure that the district as a whole comes out the other side of the pandemic in the best shape possible.”
Jill Foster, owner of Retford and Gainsborough Garden Centre, said “We’re thrilled to be working with North Notts BID on this initiative. We feel that – now more than ever – this fabulous gesture from the BID brings some much-needed Christmas spirit and excitement back into the schools and we fully support and back their efforts.
“In addition, the fact that our trees are grown just over the county border in Lincolnshire means that we’re also able to support local tree growers during this difficult time as well.”
One of the schools that took part in the scheme is Outwood Academy Valley, which took delivery of a seven-foot tree.
David Cavill, principal of Outwood Academy Valley, said: “We want to thank Retford and Gainsborough Garden Centre and North Notts BID for providing us with a Christmas tree this year. The smiles we see on our children’s faces when they see Christmas trees around the Academy are priceless, and it helps to get all of the students into the Christmas spirit.”

Pupils in England improving in maths but falling behind in science – Education Today,"['England', 'Maths', 'News', 'Research', 'Science']","December 8, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/pupils-in-england-improving-in-maths-but-falling-behind-in-science/,"Mathematics performance has significantly improved for year 5 pupils in England since 2015 but in year 9 science results have significantly declined, report UCL researchers who have analysed England’s performance in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).
The 2019 National Report for England, written by researchers from the UCL Institute of Education, was funded by the Department for Education. Testing of 9,595 pupils in years 5 and 9 across 368 schools in England was carried out between February and June 2019 by leading learning company, Pearson.
The report, which includes comparative data from 64 countries, places pupils in England behind those in the highest-performing group of countries, but significantly above the TIMSS average scores for mathematics and science. As in previous years, Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Russia all performed strongly across both subjects and year groups.
Co-author Dr Mary Richardson (UCL Institute of Education) said: “Our analysis of the data means we’ve been able to look not only at how pupils perform in mathematics and science, but to what extent gender, socioeconomic status, school and home environment impact on their educational performance.
“This year we see England has performed, on average, significantly above most other countries. Compared to the 2015 results, most notably, England’s performance in maths has significantly improved at year 5 and decreased significantly in science at year 9.
“Longitudinal data like this can help us understand these trends and we will now seek to interpret why these trends have occurred. For example, the study reveals that, unlike in 2015, year 5 boys’ average mathematics score was not significantly above year 5 girls’ scores.”
The report also highlighted significant gender differences in attitudes towards maths and science. In both year groups and subjects, boys were significantly more confident, and liked learning more than girls. Boys also valued both subjects more in year 9 (which was the only year group asked about how much they valued the subjects). Significantly more girls than boys were not confident, and/or did not like, mathematics and science.
For example, looking at year 5 pupils’ confidence in mathematics, significantly more boys said they were very confident compared to girls (39% compared to 24%).
Co-author, Dr Tina Isaacs (UCL Institute of Education) added: “The TIMSS data enables us to draw comparison between the attitudes of boys and girls in each subject in their respective year groups and to compare England’s gender differences with those of other countries.
“Despite social concerns about the differences between boys’ and girls’ performance, the results show that they’ve performed largely at the same level in both subjects and both year groups. However, girls still are less confident, and don’t much like, mathematics and science.
“There is already a plethora of research underway into why girls lack confidence in and enjoyment of mathematics and science, and the data may hold useful findings for researchers studying these and other behavioural issues.”
The National Research Coordinator for TIMSS 2019, Dr. Grace Grima, (Director of Research at Pearson), said: “Pearson was delighted to be chosen by the Department for Education to deliver this important, international assessment in mathematics and science.
“This trends study provides policy makers with rich, internationally comparable data and information on student attainment and attitudes that will inform policies and support the teaching and learning of mathematics and science.
“Having pioneered the transition to eTIMSS in 2019 in England, we were pleased to successfully deliver these assessments using an innovative tablet-based platform in both primary and secondary schools.”

NewVIc media production students take over BT Sport – Education Today,"['Audio, Visual & Presentation', 'Careers', 'Digital skills', 'Further Education', 'News']","December 7, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/newvic-media-production-students-take-over-bt-sport/,"BT Sport and NewVIc have done it again producing a magazine style studio show, created by 12 NewVIc media production students on an eight-week film making course. NewVIc was lucky to be selected in 2019 when the project launched, giving local students from diverse background the chance to experience and work in a real broadcast environment and empowering them to create a TV show. Last year the project went so well, BT Sport aired the final show on BT Sport channels and their social media platforms. BT Sport have signed off the new show for 2020 after being really impressed with the programme students created which will be aired nationally later this month.
The objective of the project is to create a professional magazine style show based on lifestyle, culture and events in the sporting world. The project has given NewVIc students a once in a life-time opportunity to take full creative control of the content produced, with training and guidance provided by BT Sport staff along the way, providing students theoretical and practical experience. The annual project forms a part of BT Sport’s commitment to involve local communities that surround the channels production site at Here East in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
Licia Conn, Producer for BT Sport, said: ‘The course this year definitely felt like a bigger challenge to achieve within the current pandemic. But the students that enrolled this year were so committed to the course, and gave everything they have to give, that we ended up creating a programme that was just as strong as last year, if not more so! It was a pure pleasure being part of the course, and getting to know all the students individually. I felt very lucky to be part of the Takeover team.’
Wiktoria, Level 3 Media Production student added: “What an incredible experience, eight weeks of pure fun and learning so much. Being in this environment and working on the floor of an actual studio on a professional video and shadowing staff, you don’t do that every day. Without NewVIc and BT Sport this wouldn’t have been possible and I am so grateful for this opportunity. I can take this experience with me to help me in my future career. It has also widened my thoughts about media production as I have always had a passion for it and where it could lead, I can’t talk highly enough for what this experience has meant to me.”
Maria Kelesidi, Media Teacher, Newham Sixth Form College, said: “This was an exciting opportunity for students from NewVIc to produce a 22-minute magazine-style studio show that is based on lifestyle, culture and events in the sporting world from their own perspective that represents London. A superb learning opportunity on all aspects of production. We are extremely proud of these students and what they have achieved with the project and very lucky to be working with BT Sport, giving students this experience in a real working environment for two years running.”
The student-produced show will premiere in a private event with family and friends then going live on Saturday 26 December at 6.45pm BTS2, following Live Gallagher Premiership Rugby – Northampton Saints v Worcester Warriors.
It will also run on ESPN in December at the following times: 27/12 8.30am, 28/12 5.30pm and 28/12 at 11pm.

Next generation of young dancers supported through iPad roll-out – Education Today,"['Digital learning', 'Music, Stage & Drama', 'News', 'Resources', 'Scotland', 'Secondary schools', 'Student engagement']","December 4, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/next-generation-of-young-dancers-supported-through-ipad-roll-out/,"Glasgow secondary school Rosshall Academy is using iPad across a range of subjects including Dance and Drama to enhance pupils learning experience during the pandemic.
The school received their iPad deployment as part of Glasgow City Council’s digital learning strategy, in conjunction with CGI, and been using the devices as teaching tools since they were rolled out to pupils in August 2020.
The devices are used in 50% of all Dance classes at the school, led by teacher and Digital Literacy Coordinator, Sophie Lamont, who has found that they have provided new ways for pupils to express their own creativity and improve their technical skills.

Sophie Lamont (left, with Rosshall Academy students) said, “People might initially think digital devices are only useful across more theoretical subjects, but I frequently make use of them in my Dance classes, with great success. The slow-motion function of the video app has made it easier to highlight certain moves they need to learn or can demonstrate ways they can improve their technique. Whether it’s adding shoulder roll or improving a plie, seeing their movements in this detail is what is allowing students to access the next stage of their ability.”
The class use iPad apps Keynote and Pages and through the video function the pupils can send recordings to their teachers for assessment and receive feedback on their performance and skills.
Sophie continued: “In using the devices, the pupils can clearly see areas where they are excelling or need to improve, encouraging control and balance within the choreography, which they would miss just by watching themselves in a mirror performing. This can lead to big improvements in their confidence and technical ability, which helps them elevate their performance and I am certain, will support them as they progress, helping them to achieve their National 5 or Higher qualification.
“Using iPad in subjects like Dance will also give the next generation of dancers the skills they need to thrive in an industry that will ultimately be digital led. They will be able to adapt and communicate quickly and easily deliver a higher quality performance as they can be more aware of their own skills.”
Councillor Chris Cunningham, City Convener for Education, Skills and Early Years said: “We are delighted with the success of the Connected Learning programme and the completion of the iPad deployment across all of our schools. What’s become very apparent is the flexibility across all subject matters and how our teachers and pupils have engaged with iPad to improve creativity, connectivity, and accessibility across learning and teaching.”
Supporting the use of iPad to improve dance skills and technique, Linzi McLagan, Head of Education at YDance (Scottish Youth Dance), said: “During the pandemic, iPad has enabled YDance to maintain our engagement with young people across Scotland, albeit differently. Technology has allowed us to stay connected, and record and reflect on our dance practice for both peer and self-analysis. We can’t wait to put all we’ve learnt into practice and continue to use technology as a support tool for live dance in the studio.”",glasgow secondary school rosshall academy is using ipad across a range of subject including dance and drama to enhance pupil learning experience during the pandemic the school received their ipad deployment a part of glasgow city council digital learning strategy in conjunction with cgi and been using the device a teaching tool since they were rolled out to pupil in august the device are used in of all dance class at the school led by teacher and digital literacy coordinator sophie lamont who ha found that they have provided new way for pupil to express their own creativity and improve their technical skill credit ian georgeson sophie lamont left with rosshall academy student said people might initially think digital device are only useful across more theoretical subject but i frequently make use of them in my dance class with great success the slowmotion function of the video app ha made it easier to highlight certain move they need to learn or can demonstrate way they can improve their technique whether it adding shoulder roll or improving a plie seeing their movement in this detail is what is allowing student to access the next stage of their ability the class use ipad apps keynote and page and through the video function the pupil can send recording to their teacher for assessment and receive feedback on their performance and skill sophie continued in using the device the pupil can clearly see area where they are excelling or need to improve encouraging control and balance within the choreography which they would miss just by watching themselves in a mirror performing this can lead to big improvement in their confidence and technical ability which help them elevate their performance and i am certain will support them a they progress helping them to achieve their national or higher qualification using ipad in subject like dance will also give the next generation of dancer the skill they need to thrive in an industry that will ultimately be digital led they will be able to adapt and communicate quickly and easily deliver a higher quality performance a they can be more aware of their own skill councillor chris cunningham city convener for education skill and early year said we are delighted with the success of the connected learning programme and the completion of the ipad deployment across all of our school whats become very apparent is the flexibility across all subject matter and how our teacher and pupil have engaged with ipad to improve creativity connectivity and accessibility across learning and teaching supporting the use of ipad to improve dance skill and technique linzi mclagan head of education at ydance scottish youth dance said during the pandemic ipad ha enabled ydance to maintain our engagement with young people across scotland albeit differently technology ha allowed u to stay connected and record and reflect on our dance practice for both peer and selfanalysis we cant wait to put all weve learnt into practice and continue to use technology a a support tool for live dance in the studio,"['dance', 'student', 'app', 'dancer', 'class', 'teaching', 'teacher', 'choreography', 'apps', 'ipad']"

One month since it launched, the World Literacy Foundation’s (WLF) UK initiative has received an overwhelming response from charity partners and community organisations, demonstrating the serious need for children living in deprivation to increase access to fun and engaging books and literacy support.
Head of UK and EU for WLF Caroline Burkie said, “Every child, no matter their circumstances should have a book of their own at home so that they can experience the joy of reading and reach their full potential. When a child struggles with reading it impacts upon every aspect of their life and they do not have the same life opportunities as their literate peers. 380,000 children do not own a book at home and this Christmas, children living in poverty who were struggling with literacy before Covid-19 hit, will be experiencing the devastating effects of a widened literacy learning gap. Having the opportunity to read books at home alone and with their family is essential to support their development, wellbeing and future.”
Working closely with a network of community groups, charity partners and UK Reads Ambassadors, high quality second hand books donated by Awesome Books are distributed to the UK’s most deprived areas and most in need children and young people.
Sannah Maan, Chief Giving Officer at Awesome Books said, “Donating books and empowering people through literacy one of our core values so we are delighted to see books going to children who need them most, especially this Christmas”.
Ms Burkie continued, “We are extremely grateful for the awareness that Marcus Rashford has raised about the urgent need to support children and young people struggling with literacy and the world that books can open to them if given the right resources. It is so important for young people to have positive role models and stories to relate to especially during such uncertain times. Book deliveries are being made across the country to emergency baby support groups, food banks and schools, all within the UK’s most deprived areas and it is only possible due to the donations people give.”
The charity’s Christmas Appeal, ‘Give the gift of literacy’ is raising money to provide books and literacy support to the 380,000 children who are at risk of losing out on the most formative years of their lives with fun and engaging books.

NFER releases new report on children’s development – Education Today,"['Early years', 'KS1', 'News', 'Research', 'Social issues']","December 1, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/nfer-release-new-report-on-childrens-development/,"New analysis of data collected by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has identified the most significant factors affecting the development of five-year-old children across England. Today’s report, published by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER), examines the data collected by the International Early Learning and Child Well-being Study (IELS) as organised by OECD.
IELS showed that five-year-old children in England achieved similar development to their peers in Estonia – the highest-performing OECD country in the PISA study at age 15 – and greater development than children in the USA.
The analysis shows us where there are development gaps, and identifies which groups of children may need additional support.
NFER was contracted by the Department for Education to analyse this data and report on their findings. The research examines early learning outcomes in emergent literacy, emergent numeracy, self-regulation, social-emotional development and physical development. These key aspects combine to present a holistic picture of young children’s development.
IELS involved children taking part in a range of interactive stories and games. Teachers and parents were also asked to assess children’s development in some aspects of social-emotional development.
Key findings from the report are outlined below:
Low birthweight was associated with lower physical and cognitive development, but not social and emotional development
Children whose parents had reported them as having low birthweight had statistically significantly lower levels of emergent literacy, emergent numeracy, working memory and physical development at age 5 compared to their peers. The largest development gap was found in physical development – equivalent to approximately nine months, while these children were also three months’ behind in emergent literacy, and four months’ behind in emergent numeracy and working memory.
However, low birthweight was not significantly related to development in any of the social-emotional measures in IELS such as trust or emotion identification.
Children’s physical development is significantly related to deprivation and gender
Children who were eligible for free school meals were on average eight months’ behind their more affluent peers for physical development. Five-year-old girls were on average nine months’ ahead of boys.
Children’s development across different outcomes at five-years-old is highly interrelated
Five-year-old children with greater development in early literacy (including listening comprehension, phonological awareness and vocabulary) are more likely to have similarly strong development in early numeracy. There were also strong correlations between high development in mental flexibility and working memory, while physical development was strongly correlated with prosocial behaviour and Trust.  The fact that there were significant relationships between children’s development in different areas suggests that a whole range of different areas of learning are important for children’s development.
Children with English as an additional language can be at risk in certain aspects of their development
Children with English as an additional language were approximately eight months’ behind their peers for emergent literacy and three months’ behind their peers for emergent numeracy. In addition, they were approximately three months’ behind their peers in mental flexibility, working memory and emotion attribution. However, they showed similar development to their peers in inhibition, non-disruptive behaviour and physical development.
Persistence is associated with early development
Children whose teachers rated them as ‘often or always’ persistent at the age of five were more than 12 months’ ahead of their peers rated as ‘rarely or never’ persistent for physical development. These children were also approximately 11 months’ ahead of their peers in emergent literacy, and 8 months’ ahead in emergent numeracy.
There are a range of simple activities parents can do to aid their children’s development
The research showed that children who drew or painted at home three or four times a week showed some evidence of better physical development than those that did not, equivalent to five months’ difference. Physical development covers gross motor skills, such as the ability to run and jump, as well as fine motor skills, such as using scissors to cut around a shape or putting on a coat without help. IELS also provides evidence of other simple activities parents can do to aid their children’s development at age 5, including reading to them every day, making sure they have access to children’s books at home, having regular conversations about their feelings, and being involved with their school.
Caroline Sharp, Research Director at NFER, said: “As we count the cost of the pandemic on children’s development and wellbeing, these findings feel particularly important. We know that too many pupils, particularly the most deprived, have been so adversely affected over the past year, and this research gives new insight into how we can best support those most at risk.
“In particular, this research demonstrates the impact that low birthweight can have on young children’s development across a number of measures. This new information shows that we must raise awareness of this issue, monitor the development of children with low birthweight for longer, and provide additional support for their development in these areas.”",new analysis of data collected by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd ha identified the most significant factor affecting the development of fiveyearold child

New research suggests using storybooks to help young children with maths – Education Today,"['Early years', 'KS1', 'News', 'Research']","November 30, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-research-suggests-using-storybooks-to-help-young-children-with-maths/,"Storybooks and tutoring could be important tools for improving young children’s maths skills, according to a new review.
In a review of international evidence into teaching and learning Early Years and Key Stage 1 maths, published on 27th November, researchers make several recommendations for classroom-based interventions. They identified a small, but growing body of research which advocated teachers using storybooks to support mathematical talk and discussion with three-to-seven-year-olds. Tutoring programmes, especially for low-attaining children, were also found to have a positive impact on maths achievement. However, the review emphasized that this was only likely to be the case with planned interventions which were designed to address specific weakness in numeracy.
Almost all the effective tutoring programmes had been developed by experts and were based on research into children’s mathematical development.
Loughborough’s Dr Colin Foster, of the Mathematics Education Centre, said: “Improving children’s maths skills is an important aspect of education and anything which helps educators do this is vital for their development. Using storybooks could be a good way of helping children build more sophisticated mathematical ideas. However, we did find that teachers needed to carefully consider which storybooks to use and how to use them. There was a similar caveat for tutoring. The programmes we reviewed had an impact on learning and achievement. But successful interventions tended to be structured and designed around specific needs and involved regular sessions lasting a term or longer.”
The review made five key recommendations:

Develop practitioners’ understanding of how children learn mathematics
Dedicate time for children to learn mathematics and integrate mathematics throughout the day
Use manipulatives and representations to develop understanding
Ensure that teaching builds on what children already know
Use high quality targeted support to help all children learn mathematics

Other teaching aids highlighted in the review included computer-assisted instruction and explicit teaching.
Researchers found a large body of evidence demonstrating that interventions delivered through apps or computer-assisted instruction, or where guidance from teachers is high, can have a positive effect on children’s attainment in mathematics. However, much of the evidence relates to software that is not distributed in England or designed for the English mathematics curriculum.
Professor Jeremy Hodgen, of the UCL Institute of Education, added: “Raising young children’s attainment in maths is vitally important and particularly so during the current pandemic. Our review, and the guidance it informed, provides valuable evidence for teachers and other educators about effective ways of improving young children’s understanding of mathematics.”
The review, Early Years and Key Stage 1 Mathematics Teaching: Evidence Review, was published by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and written by a team from the UCL Institute of Education (IOE), the University of Brighton, Loughborough University and Ulster University. It was written by Professor Jeremy Hodgen (IOE), Dr Nancy Barclay (University of Brighton), Dr Colin Foster (Loughborough University), Professor Camilla Gilmore (Loughborough University), Dr Rachel Marks (University of Brighton) and Dr Victoria Simms (Ulster University).",storybook and tutoring could be important tool for improving young childrens math skill according to a new review in a review of international evidence into teaching and learning early year and key stage math published on th november researcher make several recommendation for classroombased intervention they identified a small but growing body of research which advocated teacher using storybook to support mathematical talk and discussion with threetosevenyearolds tutoring programme especially for lowattaining child were also found to have a positive impact on math achievement however the review emphasized that this wa only likely to be the case with planned intervention which were designed to address specific weakness in numeracy almost all the effective tutoring programme had been developed by expert and were based on research into childrens mathematical development loughboroughs dr colin foster of the mathematics education centre said improving childrens math skill is an important aspect of education and anything which help educator do this is vital for their development using storybook could be a good way of helping child build more sophisticated mathematical idea however we did find that teacher needed to carefully consider which storybook to use and how to use them there wa a similar caveat for tutoring the programme we reviewed had an impact on learning and achievement but successful intervention tended to be structured and designed around specific need and involved regular session lasting a term or longer the review made five key recommendation develop practitioner understanding of how child learn mathematics dedicate time for child to learn mathematics and integrate mathematics throughout the day use manipulatives and representation to develop understanding ensure that teaching build on what child already know use high quality targeted support to help all child learn mathematics other teaching aid highlighted in the review included computerassisted instruction and explicit teaching researcher found a large body of evidence demonstrating that intervention delivered through apps or computerassisted instruction or where guidance from teacher is high can have a positive effect on childrens attainment in mathematics however much of the evidence relates to software that is not distributed in england or designed for the english mathematics curriculum professor jeremy hodgen of the ucl institute of education added raising young childrens attainment in math is vitally important and particularly so during the current pandemic our review and the guidance it informed provides valuable evidence for teacher and other educator about effective way of improving young childrens understanding of mathematics the review early year and key stage mathematics teaching evidence review wa published by the education endowment foundation eef and written by a team from the ucl institute of education ioe the university of brighton loughborough university and ulster university it wa written by professor jeremy hodgen ioe dr nancy barclay university of brighton dr colin foster loughborough university professor camilla gilmore loughborough university dr rachel mark university of brighton and dr victoria simms ulster university,"['learning', 'education', 'educator', 'teacher', 'teaching', 'mathematical', 'tutoring', 'math', 'mathematics', 'classroombased']"
River Beach Primary School staff provide food for local families – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Community engagement', 'England', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Social issues', 'Volunteering']","November 27, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/river-beach-primary-school-staff-provide-food-for-local-families/,"A team of Teaching Assistants at River Beach Primary School in Littlehampton has stepped in to help local families who faced food poverty over the school holidays. The group supplied food packages to families in need following the Government’s decision not to extend the Free School Meals programme over the October half-term.
Concerned at the likely impact, Pam Fowler, a Year 2 Teaching Assistant at River Beach, used Facebook to ask school families to contact her directly if they were concerned about feeding their children during the holidays. Several families got in touch, and Pam organised 11 Teaching Assistants from the school who not only delivered food throughout the week to families but also funded it themselves.
The group have now received offers of help from across the school community, and from Schoolsworks, the Academy Trust to which the school belongs. Donations have exceeded £350, which will be used to support River Beach families over the Christmas period as needed.
Dave Ayers, Headteacher at River Beach, commented: “River Beach is a wonderful community, and the fact that Pam and our TA team chose to work in this way to support our families in need really demonstrates this quality. This amazing group has gone above and beyond, and I am so proud of them and their incredible sense of kindness.”
Chris Seaton, CEO of Schoolsworks, added: “River Beach was one of the first schools to join our multi-academy trust and the whole team are a real pleasure to work with. Our offices are based on River Beach’s school site, and as soon as we heard about the work of Pam and her team we wanted to celebrate this extraordinary act. Since then staff from across our Trust have been keen to help by donating food and funds so that families don’t face the awful prospect of struggling to feed children during school holidays.”
Pam Fowler concluded: “We know what it’s like to be in a similar situation and just wanted to give something back to our school community.”",a team of teaching assistant at river beach primary school in littlehampton ha stepped in to help local family who faced food poverty over the school holiday the group supplied food package to family in need following the government decision not to extend the free school meal programme over the october halfterm concerned at the likely impact pam fowler a year teaching assistant at river beach used facebook to ask school family to contact her directly if they were concerned about feeding their child during the holiday several family got in touch and pam organised teaching assistant from the school who not only delivered food throughout the week to family but also funded it themselves the group have now received offer of help from across the school community and from schoolsworks the academy trust to which the school belongs donation have exceeded which will be used to support river beach family over the christmas period a needed dave ayers headteacher at river beach commented river beach is a wonderful community and the fact that pam and our ta team chose to work in this way to support our family in need really demonstrates this quality this amazing group ha gone above and beyond and i am so proud of them and their incredible sense of kindness chris seaton ceo of schoolsworks added river beach wa one of the first school to join our multiacademy trust and the whole team are a real pleasure to work with our office are based on river beach school site and a soon a we heard about the work of pam and her team we wanted to celebrate this extraordinary act since then staff from across our trust have been keen to help by donating food and fund so that family dont face the awful prospect of struggling to feed child during school holiday pam fowler concluded we know what it like to be in a similar situation and just wanted to give something back to our school community,"['donation', 'teaching', 'poverty', 'feeding', 'donating', 'christmas', 'holiday', 'ceo', 'facebook', 'headteacher']"

Marking is the key driver of work stress among teachers – Education Today,"['News', 'Research', 'Wellbeing']","November 25, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/marking-is-the-key-driver-of-work-stress-among-teachers/,"Marking and lesson planning are the two aspects of teachers’ jobs that lead to the greatest increase in workload stress and levels of poor wellbeing, according to a new study by UCL researchers.
The working paper is published today by the Nuffield Foundation, who also funded the report. It analysed data from the 2018 Teaching and Learning International Study (TALIS) and included survey answers from 9,405 teachers in five predominantly English-speaking education systems from England, Australia, Alberta-Canada, New Zealand and the United States.
The study highlights that teachers across England work some of the longest hours in Europe and recent research by the UCL Institute of Education found that a quarter of teachers work more than 59 hours a week.
Lead author, Professor John Jerrim (UCL Institute of Education) said:“ Our study shows that is it not just as case of saying extra hours lead to extra stress among teachers, but what they are doing in those hours.
“We found that for every extra hour teachers spend on marking and planning there is a significant association with decline in wellbeing at work. This is most likely because these are often tasks done at the evening, weekend and during school holidays.
“We also found that other aspects of the job such as extra time spent teaching or working with colleagues and undertaking professional development appear to have little direct effect upon the quality of working life.”
The study also found the relationship between teachers’ working hours and their wellbeing may not be linear. For example, if teachers worked 35 hours a week, adding an extra hour or two may not lead to serious consequences.
“However, for those working 60 hours a week, an additional hour or two of work could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” explained Professor Jerrim.
Additionally, the paper also highlighted the inequality in hours worked and levels of wellbeing experienced by full-time teachers. The findings suggested that full-time primary teachers in England who work 40 hours per week could increase this to 45 or even 50 hours with little effect upon their workload stress and wellbeing. At the same time, a reduction of five or ten hours amongst those teachers who currently work 60 or more hours per week might potentially lead to an appreciable increase in this group’s quality of life.
Co-author, Dr Sam Sims (UCL Institute of Education) added: “Our findings have important implications for education policy. There are two clear areas where reducing teachers’ workloads would help reduce stress: lesson preparation and marking.
With respect to the former, perhaps the easiest thing that policymakers can do is dramatically reduce examination, curriculum and inspection reforms – all of which create new work for teachers, who are forced to change lessons, materials and teaching styles as a result.”

"Threats to extracurricular learning could accelerate youth mental health crisis, warns The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award – Education Today","['Charity', 'Citizenship', 'Community engagement', 'Coronavirus', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Student engagement', 'Volunteering', 'Wellbeing']","November 24, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/threats-to-extracurricular-learning-could-accelerate-youth-mental-health-crisis-warns-the-duke-of-edinburghs-award/,"New research conducted in October 2020 amongst a sample of 2,728 DofE participants of school/college age by The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award (DofE), has today revealed the transformative impact that extracurricular learning, such as volunteering, developing a skill or getting better at a sport, can have on young people’s wellbeing – and how COVID-19 is putting the future of these activities at risk.
The charity is warning that this threat, exacerbated by the latest lockdown measures, could accelerate the mental health crisis facing young people across the UK. More than half (54%) of young people the DofE surveyed worry their levels of stress, anxiety or mental health issues could increase if they are no longer able to continue with the activities and experiences helping them cope with the pandemic.
During the pandemic, extracurricular learning has been a lifeline for many young people, helping to maintain and boost resilience and mental health. 43% of DofE participants surveyed said they felt volunteering, doing exercise or learning a new skill has given them a positive focus during COVID-19, while nearly two thirds (64%) are more appreciative of non-academic activities as a result of the pandemic.
Yet as problems with sleep, depression and self-harm in children rise and youth unemployment is set to triple, access to these life-changing activities is under threat. Even when lockdowns are not in place, many youth clubs and classes remain closed and young people themselves are feeling pressure to give up activities. The DofE’s survey uncovered that 71% of participants that responded have had to cut back on extracurricular activities due to academic pressures caused by COVID-19. Nearly a quarter (22.5%) worry they might have to sacrifice extracurricular activities because they are more concerned about their parents’ financial situation.
In response, The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award has launched its Resilience Fund to ensure thousands of young people facing disadvantage are able to participate in DofE, which has been shown to help increase wellbeing, confidence and resilience. Thanks to a very generous donation the Fund will provide 12,000 funded DofE places for young people facing disadvantage, and train thousands of DofE Leaders, Managers and volunteers to further strengthen the charity’s support for young people from under-privileged backgrounds.
While the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have taken steps to recognise the value of extracurricular learning, funding services and positive activities for young people before and throughout the pandemic, young people in England have faced years of brutal cuts that have eroded their infrastructure of support.
Today the DofE is calling on the UK Government to act urgently to prevent a wider mental health crisis, by ensuring the quality provision of extracurricular learning in England is prioritised, adequately funded and enabled, in line with safety guidelines, in Government COVID-19 guidance.
This includes:

Providing emergency funding for youth organisations so they can continue providing essential support and extracurricular learning, including releasing the £500m investment in youth services promised as part of the UK Government’s 2019 manifesto.
Investing in developing a diverse, high quality and sustainable youth offer, particularly in areas of deprivation, to ensure all young people can access opportunities, activities and experiences that are essential to their development and wellbeing.

Harry, who is doing his Gold DofE in Wigton, Cumbria, shares why extracurricular learning is so important to him: “When lockdown started, I was scared to leave my house and struggled to find anything good in life. I have autism and a rare genetic condition which heightened my anxieties. For my DofE volunteering, I grew vegetables in my allotment to share with local people who were shielding. Doing this helped me feel less anxious, more confident, and speaking to other allotment holders from a distance has helped me learn to socialise safely. Being outdoors helps me relax and stay calm.”
Ruth Marvel, CEO of the DofE, said: “These threats to extracurricular learning could have devastating impacts on the mental health and future prospects of young people – especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, many of whom have been hit hardest by COVID-19. Non-academic education is just as important as academic learning, and the UK Government must prioritise it as such. To face the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, young people need and deserve the increased resilience, confidence and independence built through extracurricular learning.”
A new report, also published today by the DofE, produced with the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER), highlights the long-lasting impact DofE programmes have on young people’s wellbeing and mental health, as well as building valuable skills for their future and prospects of employment. It reports that 62% of participants say doing their DofE made them more confident in overcoming difficult situations, 61% feel they have become more independent, 67% say it helped them feel more responsible, and 70% said it made them feel proud of what they can achieve.
Throughout the pandemic, the DofE has been supporting tens of thousands of young people across the UK to continue their extracurricular learning through DofE With A Difference, providing physical, skills-based and volunteering opportunities that can be easily done from home.",new research conducted in october amongst a sample of dofe participant of schoolcollege age by the duke of edinburgh

University of Birmingham to reduce entry requirements for 2021 by one grade in recognition of impact of Covid-19 on A level students – Education Today,"['A levels', 'Coronavirus', 'Exams', 'Higher education', 'News']","November 23, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/university-of-birmingham-to-reduce-entry-requirements-for-2021-by-one-grade-in-recognition-of-impact-of-covid-19-on-a-level-students/,"Every part of society has been impacted by Covid-19, but its longest lasting effects may well be on the young, with those due to sit GCSEs and A levels, or equivalent, this summer amongst those most affected.
As well as facing almost a year of disruption to their studies as a consequence of the initial closure of schools and more recently whole year groups being placed into isolation, they also face continuing uncertainty around the forthcoming A-level cycle.
In order to support sixth-form students due to sit their exams in the UK next summer and help ensure they are not disadvantaged compared with those who sat their exams before Covid as well as future cohorts, the University of Birmingham has announced that it will be introducing additional flexibility around its admissions approach this year. This will involve reducing the entry requirements across the majority of its undergraduate degree programmes by one grade.
The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Birmingham, Professor Sir David Eastwood said: “We recognise the need to adapt our admissions approach for this year given the extraordinary disruption affecting these students and their schools and the fact that many are likely to experience more than a year of interrupted learning by the time they sit their exams next summer.
“We have considered what we can do as a University to recognise and reward potential, mitigate some of the educational challenges as result of Covid, and reduce some of the pressure on students and teachers at this challenging time. Providing greater flexibility in our admissions for 2021 entry is one such area. Reducing the entry requirements for almost all of our programmes by one grade will, we hope, alleviate some of the anxieties and ensure that anyone who chooses to apply to study at the University of Birmingham is given the best opportunity to succeed in that ambition.”
The headline adjustment to entry grades will be applied across the majority of programmes. It will also be applied to any widening participation applicants at the University of Birmingham such as through the Pathways to Birmingham programme or contextual offer-making. In implementing this change the University also recognises the wider need to review university admissions nationally in order to develop a more effective admissions system that puts the needs of students front and centre.
The programmes that are not included are Medicine, Dentistry and Dental Hygiene, Nursing, Physiotherapy, and Social Work, where there is external regulation, as well as the University’s Foundation Year and degree apprenticeship programmes.",every part of society ha been impacted by covid but it longest lasting effect may well be on the young with those due to sit gcse and a level or equivalent this summer amongst those most affected a well a facing almost a year of disruption to their study a a consequence of the initial closure of school and more recently whole year group being placed into isolation they also face continuing uncertainty around the forthcoming alevel cycle in order to support sixthform student due to sit their exam in the uk next summer and help ensure they are not disadvantaged compared with those who sat their exam before covid a well a future cohort the university of birmingham ha announced that it will be introducing additional flexibility around it admission approach this year this will involve reducing the entry requirement across the majority of it undergraduate degree programme by one grade the vicechancellor of the university of birmingham professor sir david eastwood said we recognise the need to adapt our admission approach for this year given the extraordinary disruption affecting these student and their school and the fact that many are likely to experience more than a year of interrupted learning by the time they sit their exam next summer we have considered what we can do a a university to recognise and reward potential mitigate some of the educational challenge a result of covid and reduce some of the pressure on student and teacher at this challenging time providing greater flexibility in our admission for entry is one such area reducing the entry requirement for almost all of our programme by one grade will we hope alleviate some of the anxiety and ensure that anyone who chooses to apply to study at the university of birmingham is given the best opportunity to succeed in that ambition the headline adjustment to entry grade will be applied across the majority of programme it will also be applied to any widening participation applicant at the university of birmingham such a through the pathway to birmingham programme or contextual offermaking in implementing this change the university also recognises the wider need to review university admission nationally in order to develop a more effective admission system that put the need of student front and centre the programme that are not included are medicine dentistry and dental hygiene nursing physiotherapy and social work where there is external regulation a well a the university foundation year and degree apprenticeship programme,"['university', 'anxiety', 'undergraduate', 'student', 'professor', 'exam', 'medicine', 'nursing', 'teacher', 'summer']"

Coventry academy shortlisted for prestigious industry award – Education Today,"['Academies', 'Apprenticeships', 'Awards', 'ICT', 'News']","November 19, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/coventry-academy-shortlisted-for-prestigious-industry-award/,"A Coventry academy has been shortlisted for a prestigious industry award in recognition of its successful apprenticeship programme.
The Romero Catholic Academy, made up of seven primary schools and one secondary school based across the city, has been announced as a finalist for The Learning Awards’ ‘Apprenticeship Programme of the Year’ award.
The Academy, which includes Corpus Christi, Good Shepherd, Sacred Heart, St Gregory’s, St John Fisher, St Patrick’s and Ss Peter and Paul Catholic Primary Schools and Cardinal Wiseman School, was shortlisted for its IT apprenticeship programme.
The Romero apprenticeships are delivered through Primary Goal, an apprenticeship provider which works with schools across the country.
The programme, which was introduced at the Academy in 2017, not only allows apprentices to gain new skills and qualifications but has also seen external IT costs dramatically reduced, problems solved quicker and projects progressed.
Thanks to its success, the Academy has now launched a sports apprenticeship programme and is looking at other areas where apprentices could be introduced.
The Learning Awards are the highest accolade that can be received in workplace learning and development, with finalists across the categories including leading names in finance, health, retail, communications, education, travel and hospitality.
The Academy will give a virtual presentation on its apprenticeship programme to a panel of judges next month before the winners are announced at the Hilton Hotel, Park Lane London on February 18 next year.
Patrick Taggart, Director of Operations at the Academy, said: “We are extremely pleased to be shortlisted for such a prestigious award which recognises the very best in learning and development.
“We have worked hard on our apprenticeship programme and invested heavily in it, so it is something we are extremely proud of.
“As an academy of schools, we understand the importance of not only taking on talented individuals to help provide our children with the very best education, but also offering young people opportunities in which they can develop their skills and progress in their careers.
“Through working with Primary Goal, we have seen our IT apprentices thrive and make a real difference across the Academy.
“As their expertise has increased we have seen our external IT support costs reduce by £80,000 and projects which were once just pipe dreams come into fruition. These include becoming completely cloud based, new WIFI infrastructures at most of our schools and a staff intranet system and Romero University portal which will help our 500 staff access learning and development opportunities.
“Last year we saw one of our apprentices presented with the Coventry Guild Apprentice of the Year award and it is fantastic to keep the success going with this recognition for our programme.”
Louise Campton, MD at Primary Goal, said: “We have been working with the Romero Catholic Academy since 2017 and are delighted that the apprentices have done so well. The programme supports them over a 15-month period and many have progressed to employed ICT technician roles in the Academy.”",a coventry academy ha been shortlisted for a prestigious industry award in recognition of it successful apprenticeship programme the romero catholic academy made up of seven primary school and one secondary school based across the city ha been announced a a finalist for the learning award apprenticeship programme of the year award the academy which includes corpus christi good shepherd sacred heart st gregory st john fisher st patrick and s peter and paul catholic primary school and cardinal wiseman school wa shortlisted for it it apprenticeship programme the romero apprenticeship are delivered through primary goal an apprenticeship provider which work with school across the country the programme which wa introduced at the academy in not only allows apprentice to gain new skill and qualification but ha also seen external it cost dramatically reduced problem solved quicker and project progressed thanks to it success the academy ha now launched a sport apprenticeship programme and is looking at other area where apprentice could be introduced the learning award are the highest accolade that can be received in workplace learning and development with finalist across the category including leading name in finance health retail communication education travel and hospitality the academy will give a virtual presentation on it apprenticeship programme to a panel of judge next month before the winner are announced at the hilton hotel park lane london on february next year patrick taggart director of operation at the academy said we are extremely pleased to be shortlisted for such a prestigious award which recognises the very best in learning and development we have worked hard on our apprenticeship programme and invested heavily in it so it is something we are extremely proud of a an academy of school we understand the importance of not only taking on talented individual to help provide our child with the very best education but also offering young people opportunity in which they can develop their skill and progress in their career through working with primary goal we have seen our it apprentice thrive and make a real difference across the academy a their expertise ha increased we have seen our external it support cost reduce by and project which were once just pipe dream come into fruition these include becoming completely cloud based new wifi infrastructure at most of our school and a staff intranet system and romero university portal which will help our staff access learning and development opportunity last year we saw one of our apprentice presented with the coventry guild apprentice of the year award and it is fantastic to keep the success going with this recognition for our programme louise campton md at primary goal said we have been working with the romero catholic academy since and are delighted that the apprentice have done so well the programme support them over a month period and many have progressed to employed ict technician role in the academy,"['apprenticeship', 'apprentice', 'catholic', 'cardinal', 'university', 'taggart', 'coventry', 'february', 'workplace', 'finalist']"
Witchford Village College unveils revamped science labs – Education Today,"['Buildings & Maintenance', 'Design & Build', 'England', 'News', 'School Improvements', 'Science', 'Secondary schools']","November 18, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/witchford-village-college-unveils-revamped-science-labs/,"Witchford Village College, a secondary school on the outskirts of Ely, has unveiled its three recently renovated on-site science labs, significantly improving science facilities at the school and creating a vibrant and dynamic learning space for everyone to use. Following a successful bid for funding of over £200,000, the work also included the building of the school’s very own large storage room, used for holding equipment for the in-class experiments, and refurbishment of a preparation room and Lab 5. These projects were carried out and completed by the resident site team over the summer holidays.
Newly refurbished, the science labs allow for easy cleaning between lessons and space for social distancing, adhering to COVID-19 guidelines. Part of the refurbishment work included brand-new benches with wipe-clean laminate surface and a new layout of the lab, enabling greater flexibility to complete group work and giving students the chance to section off into their own bubbles.
Bessie Owen, Head of School, Witchford Village College, said: “Despite the unusual circumstances that 2020 has brought to education, we’ve been working hard behind the scenes to ensure that our students are met with the best possible experience as they continue to integrate into the ‘new normal’ of school life. These refurbishments reflect our new way of teaching and operating and I’m extremely proud of how our site team pulled together to make this possible”.
As well as the project being developed with the school’s safety guidelines in mind, everything has been refurbished to ensure the highest quality learning experience for the students. This has included: new natural daylight LED lighting, which has been built into the ceilings to ensure better lighting conditions for students to focus, new blinds which will allow effective blackout for practical work on topics such as the properties of light, measuring the rate of photosynthesis or flame tests, and new state of the art 86-inch interactive screens to allow all students to proactively follow the lesson and also interact with the boards themselves.
Owen continued: “The science labs have not been refurbished or modernised since the school was built, so it’s been fantastic to see the students making the most out of our new facilities this term. At Witchford Village College we are committed to providing a learning environment in which all of our students have the ability to realise their potential. These new labs will do just that”.
These changes come at an exciting time for Witchford Village College, as the community continues to grow and evolve from its connection to Eastern Learning Alliance. Eastern Learning Alliance is a purposeful family of schools, each with its own distinct identity. Each school within the Trust offers academic rigour, excellent extra-curricular opportunities and values the arts and performing arts.

"Friendships help say children, as one in three report being bullied since Covid outbreak – Education Today","['Bullying', 'Educational event', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Social issues', 'Wellbeing']","November 17, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/friendships-help-say-children-as-one-in-three-report-being-bullied-since-covid-outbreak/,"Bullying is still a significant problem in children’s lives, with a third (33.5%) of children in England saying they’ve been victims during the last six months. A poll of 2,000 11 to 16-year-olds, published to mark Anti-Bullying Week, found that one in five children said they were on the receiving end of bullying behaviour once per week or more.
However, the poll, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, suggests that Covid-19 has affected how bullying takes place, with rising numbers of children reporting incidents online or in their communities compared to a similar survey last year, and fewer children saying they had been bullied in school.
Of those who reported being bullied recently, 38% said it had taken place online, a rise from 29% in a pre-Covid survey conducted in 2019. There was a similar rise in reports of bullying in the community: with 16% of children who experienced bullying saying it had happened in their community, compared to 9% last year.
At the same time, the lengthy closure of schools for most children seems likely to account for a drop in bullying in school settings, with 74% of young people who reported being bullied in 2020 saying it took place in school, a fall from 83% in 2019.
The majority of children (65%) stressed that having lots of good friends helped protect them from being bullied. However, the number of children reporting they had more than one good friend fell by 4 percentage points, from 91% before coronavirus to 86.5% in October 2020.
Many children (38%) were anxious about returning to school in September because they feared suffering bullying behaviour. Of those who had been bullied recently, alongside the three-quarters who said it took place within school, 26% said the journey to and from school was a flashpoint.
On a positive note, an overwhelming majority (80%) said that if we work together, we can unite to reduce bullying. This message will be highlighted in the three quarters of schools in England expected to celebrate Anti-Bullying Week this year – reaching over 7 million children and drawing on teaching resources made possible with support from SafeToNet.
Odd Socks Day for Anti-Bullying Week took place on the Monday 16th Nov, when CBeebies and CBBC star Andy Day and his band Andy and the Odd Socks launched their new charity single ‘The Kids Are United’.
The song’s video, made by hundreds of pupils in their ‘bubbles’ in schools across the country, encourages young and old alike to wear odd socks to school or work and celebrate what makes us all unique. The video features 11-year-old dance sensation, Princess K, sharing fresh dance moves in support of Anti-Bullying Week, as well as Libera boys choir, a hugely popular and internationally renowned choir from South London. Andy and the band will be sharing their song and discussing bullying in an online assembly to schools across the country on the morning of Odd Socks Day, which also features messages of support from Mo Farah, McFly and Anne-Marie.

Mars education project sets out to encourage schoolkids’ stellar ambitions – Education Today,"['KS2', 'KS3', 'KS4', 'News', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Space!', 'STEM', 'Teaching resources']","November 16, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/mars-education-project-sets-out-to-encourage-schoolkids-stellar-ambitions/,"An education project which aims to bring the science of Martian exploration into the classroom is preparing for launch during National Astronomy Week (14-22 November).
The project, called Roving with Rosalind, is aimed at children aged between 7 and 14 in disadvantaged and rural areas across the UK, who often have limited opportunities to participate in science outreach activities. The project is also setting out to help teachers train to deliver more effective science education.
Schools can sign up to borrow one of five kits packed with practical science experiments and take part in a suite of online activities, each linked to national science curricula. The activities are accompanied by video introductions from real space scientists, showcasing the diversity of talent working in the field.
Each activity provides insight into a different aspect of the science experiments that will be undertaken by the robotic Rosalind Franklin rover when it touches down on Mars in 2023. The rover is a key part of the joint European/Russian ExoMars mission, set to launch in 2022, which will search for traces of life on the red planet.
At an online event on Thursday 19 November, organised as part of the Mars-focused National Astronomy Week, teachers and pupils can find out more about how Roving with Rosalind aims to recreate the experience of being a rover mission scientist.
Each kit contains a large map of the Oxia Planum area of Mars, where the Rosalind Franklin rover will land. Pupils will be able to explore the map using LEGO rovers they design and build for themselves, planning routes to points of interest where they will complete tasks to unlock ‘downloads’ of data from Mars to analyse. Those experiments will include elements of spectroscopy, physics, maths, engineering, programming and a range of other skills connected to the ExoMars mission.
Roving with Rosalind is organised by Áine O’Brien and Sara Motaghian, two Scottish planetary science PhD students. They designed the project to inspire young people from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in space-related science. The project is supported by £30,000 in funding from the UK Space Agency’s Aurora Science Education and Outreach scheme.
Áine O’Brien (pictured above) is working towards a PhD at the University of Glasgow’s School of Geographical and Earth Science. She said: “I was a physics teacher for several years before I decided to go back to academia, and I’m passionate about finding new ways to spark young people’s interest in science.
“We’ve designed the project specifically to reach pupils who don’t live within easy reach of a science centre or university. Research has shown that children who don’t have access to science outreach can feel that science isn’t a realistic career option for them
“The message of Roving with Rosalind is that science is an accessible career for anyone. The rover itself is named after Rosalind Franklin, who made huge contributions to the discovery of DNA but only recently started getting the credit she deserves.
“We’ve recorded videos with real space scientists from all walks of life to accompany the activities in our kits. We hope that their stories of how they ended up in their careers will be just as inspiring as the science experiments, and encourage kids to explore a future in science.”
Roving with Rosalind was originally set to roll out across the country in the spring, before the spread of the coronavirus pandemic closed schools and spurred a rethink of plans. Many of their resources and activities can be carried out without the physical kits themselves on the project’s learning page at https://www.stem.org.uk/user/login?destination=node/484445
University of Glasgow graduate Sara Motaghian (pictured right) is studying for a PhD with the Natural History Museum. She added: “Although we’ll now need to quarantine each physical kit between sessions in schools, we’ve made up for any potentially lost opportunities by developing online versions of the activities in each kit. We’ve added new activities, too, like the opportunity for kids to control a virtual rover using the scratch programming language.
“It’s really important to us that teachers benefit from getting involved with Roving with Rosalind, too, and get the chance to brush up on new skills. We’ve been able to reach some of them directly over the summer and we’ve developed online training alongside the new resources for them to use in the classroom.
“We really hope that pupils and teachers alike choose to get involved with Roving with Rosalind, and we’re excited to start sending out the kits to schools across the UK.”

Oliver has been using 3D printers at home to make key PPE for local key workers during the pandemic and has used the skills he has learnt in class to make more than 150 masks.
He said: “I got the inspiration from reading about people in Italy using their printers to make similar equipment in the midst of their outbreak – I thought it was a great idea and decided to do the same.”
Oliver used PVC to create the front shield and elastic to secure the masks, using the help of his mum when needed.
He added: “It’s difficult to get the printers running, but once you’re in the rhythm it’s not hard anymore, but it is time-consuming to deal with all the fiddly bits.”
He started making the masks on his own, but now supports the demand with two other Twyford residents – Oliver Beardsall and David Dawkins – and in July, he estimated that they had created more than 200 between them.

"Top authors join Story Explorers: a new podcast for kids, by kids – Education Today","['Educational event', 'Literacy', 'News']","November 9, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/top-authors-join-story-explorers-a-new-podcast-for-kids-by-kids/,"Today marks the first episode of the brand new children’s radio and podcast series Story Explorers which is all about stories for 7 to 11-year-olds. It is available on the national children’s radio station Fun Kids, and has been developed by the National Literacy Trust and Pixiu, and funded by The Audio Content Fund.
The series, hosted by CBBC presenter Ben Shires, will feature a different children’s author and group of school children each week. Budding young podcasters from Years 5 and 6 will interview and chat virtually with top authors about their work, the stories they love and also take part in fun games together.
Each interview will be broken down into five episodes, each five minutes in length and a new episode will be released weekdays at 6.15pm throughout November and December. Teachers can share these with their classes as part of their daily learning schedule the following day, or later in the week, or alternatively, children can listen to them later at home.
The episodes will be broadcast on Fun Kids during The Club with Bex, available on their website at funkidslive.com and in all popular podcast apps.
The first episode launches today and features Waterstones Children’s Laureate Cressida Cowell (How to Train Your Dragon series, Hodder Children’s Books). Listen to Cressida and children from Ashmole Primary School in London chat about dragons, quiz Cressida on her writing and get her to finish their amazing story ideas.
The fantastic line up of authors also includes: Eoin Colfer (Artemis Fowl and the Fowl Twins series, HarperCollins Children’s), Greg James and Chris Smith (Kid Normal series, Bloomsbury Children’s), Katherine Rundell (Book of Hopes, Bloomsbury Children’s), Onjali Q. Raúf (The Boy at the Back of the Class, Orion Children’s Books) and Lauren Child (Clarice Bean series, Orchard Books).
Podcast consumption has increased steadily in recent years. In fact, new research from the National Literacy Trust shows that 1 in 5 children and young people say they listen to podcasts and nearly 1 in 4 children and young people listened to podcasts or audiobooks more during lockdown than they did before.
Podcasts can be a great tool to support children’s learning, giving them greater access to a whole world of topics and this series offers insights into an author’s world from children’s perspective, with reading and storytelling at the heart of the discussions.
Daveen, pupil from Arden Primary School, said: “I felt so surprised when I saw all the equipment used to make a podcast or radio show. I felt like I was on stage performing! Even though I was really nervous, speaking with Katherine Rundell was one of the best experiences ever! Katherine’s books are amazing, especially Rooftoppers, because you can imagine you are really there. My favourite part was when we challenged Katherine to finish our story starters – she was so mesmerising!”
Cressida Cowell, Waterstones Children’s Laureate and first guest on the show, said: “I’m really glad the National Literacy Trust and Pixiu invited me to join in with this truly fun project! I loved the children’s energy and curiosity and really enjoyed the wonderful discussions we had together.
“Listening to interesting discussions about stories, books and reading can inspire children to get into stories in whatever way is best for them and I hope we spark the magic of reading in those who listen to the show. It looks like it’s going to be a fantastic line-up in the coming weeks, so do tune in!”

Arkwright Engineering Scholarship Programme launches 2021 applications – Education Today,"['Awards', 'Bursaries', 'Educational event', 'Engineering', 'News', 'Secondary schools', 'STEM']","November 6, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/arkwright-engineering-scholarship-programme-launches-2021-applications/,"Children’s education charity, The Smallpeice Trust, is calling for students and schools to sign up to its highly respected engineering scholarship programme, The Arkwright Engineering Scholarship. The programme, for which applications are now open, is designed to inspire and equip the country’s brightest young people to pursue their dreams of changing the world through engineering.
The Scholarship provides 16-year old students in the UK with a two-year fully sponsored programme of hands-on experience, professional mentorship and careers guidance across a range of specialisms, from aerospace to automotive engineering.
Supporting the next generation of engineering talent is key for the nation’s development and economic recovery amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, yet we are currently facing an annual shortage of around 60,000 talented and diverse engineers.
Misconceptions around what it means to be an engineer and a lack of opportunities to gain first-hand industry experience are some of the obstacles preventing young people, particularly girls and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, from engaging with engineering.
The Smallpeice Trust has partnered with leading engineering firms such as the RAF, Rolls Royce and Network Rail to close this gap and provide invaluable, real-world learning experiences, from getting up close and personal with a Typhoon Jet to working on national solar energy and electrical power projects.
Arkwright Engineering Scholars will also benefit from a range of enrichment opportunities to help them pursue their engineering passions, including:

A £600 financial bonus which can be used to fund technical or curriculum-based projects, the purchase of equipment and additional courses
Mentoring from industry experts, providing practical advice and guidance with technical projects, further study and careers development
Networking opportunities at exclusive events run by the Programme’s partner companies, universities and trade associations
Nationally recognised Scholarship certification to supplement university and apprenticeship applications

Scholarship applicants are encouraged to show-off their enthusiasm and engineering knowledge in an online application process, with successful students being invited to interview at one of the country’s leading universities.
If a Scholarship is awarded participating schools further receive a £400 donation which they can utilise for STEM events and resources to benefit students.
2021 also marks the 30th anniversary of The Arkwright Engineering Scholarship Programme, which is celebrating increased numbers of female scholars. In 2020, the Programme supported 296 scholars, with 45 per cent of these being female, and 38 per cent of scholar from non-selective state schools.
Kevin Stenson, CEO of The Smallpeice Trust, said: “We’re thrilled to open 2021 applications for The Arkwright Engineering Scholarship Programme and support the next generation of engineering leaders. As Covid-19 has demonstrated, the engineering industry holds the key to solving some of our biggest social, environmental, and economic challenges. It’s essential that we inspire and support young people from all backgrounds to discover the real world of engineering and achieve their full potential.
“I’m incredibly proud of the achievements of the talented Arkwright Engineering Scholars who have been playing their part during the pandemic, developing PPE using 3D printers during lockdown and launching a COVID Challenge competition to get more young people into tech. Each of our Scholars have gone on to work with engineering giants such as BAE Systems and the RAF and make a real difference in society.”
The Arkwright Engineering Scholarship Programme is open to all Year 11 students in England and Wales, S4 students in Scotland and Year 12 students in Northern Ireland.

We also recognise that financial constraints remain as one of the main barriers to participation in the arts. Now more than ever, Orchestras for All believes in the importance of music-making for young people, and its ability to transcend educational ability, socio economic status and disability. By offering a free, flexible programme of specialist coaching, digital resources and performance opportunities, we invite music teachers to sign up and create a nationwide musical network that can keep music alive in our schools during these challenging times.”

The Modulo Programme, which usually costs schools £300 per year, supports music teachers working in state secondaries to set up a small ensemble – a ‘Modulo ’- and make music together. Whether beginner violinists or experienced electric guitarists, all instruments and skill levels are welcome.

Over the past seven years, the Modulo Programme has brought thousands of young people together to perform live as a massed pop-up orchestra, opening up the benefits of music- making to many who otherwise wouldn’t get the chance. Reacting to the extra challenges of Covid-19, this year’s programme is focused on supporting teachers to keep music-making going in their schools, providing any state secondary schools who wish to participate with the following:",national music education charity orchestra for all ofa ha announced that for one year only access to their transformative modulo programme for state secondary school will be free of charge to all participant offering vital support to music teacher and young musician throughout the uk according to nick thorne ofa executive director with covid having radically changed the musicmaking landscape music department across the country are currently facing huge challenge to play music together safely we also recognise that financial constraint remain a one of the main barrier to participation in the art now more than ever orchestra for all belief in the importance of musicmaking for young people and it ability to transcend educational ability socio economic status and disability by offering a free flexible programme of specialist coaching digital resource and performance opportunity we invite music teacher to sign up and create a nationwide musical network that can keep music alive in our school during these challenging time the modulo programme which usually cost school per year support music teacher working in state secondary to set up a small ensemble a modulo and make music together whether beginner violinist or experienced electric guitarist all instrument and skill level are welcome over the past seven year the modulo programme ha brought thousand of young people together to perform live a a massed popup orchestra opening up the benefit of music making to many who otherwise wouldnt get the chance reacting to the extra challenge of covid this year programme is focused on supporting teacher to keep musicmaking going in their school providing any state secondary school who wish to participate with the following,"['live', 'musical', 'education', 'disability', 'coaching', 'musicmaking', 'orchestra', 'violinist', 'teacher', 'charity']"
Education leaders launch anti-racism collective for schools across East Anglia – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'England', 'Inclusion', 'Leadership', 'News', 'Social issues']","November 4, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/education-leaders-launch-anti-racism-collective-for-schools-across-east-anglia/,"An organisation which aims to engender positive change in the promotion and teaching of anti-racism across East Anglian education has been launched.
The East Anglia Anti-Racism Education Collective (EEAREC) will collaborate at a regional level to undertake and deliver anti-racist work across schools to benefit pupils and teaching staff.
The EEAREC was set up by Prof. Paul Miller, Professor of Educational Leadership and Social Justice, Tim Coulson, Chief Executive of the Unity Schools Partnership and Stephen Chamberlain, Chief Executive of the Active Learning Trust.
While the scandalous and tragic deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the USA have further highlighted the need to break down the systemic racism and inequality that continue to exist in society, the EEAREC is committed to promoting through education equity, inclusion, diversity, and social justice for all.
Stephen Chamberlain, Chief Executive of the Active Learning Trust which runs primary and secondary schools across Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, said: “At the forefront of the East Anglia Anti-Racism Education Collective’s ambition is the facilitation of purposeful collaboration and partnership in pursuing an anti-racist education agenda.
“Although many would like to think of ‘education’ as a subject and as a practice as ‘squeaky clean’ or racism free, that is not the case. Education perpetuates racism in two main ways: institutional racist practices, systems and structures, and through the delivery of a curriculum that is not racially inclusive.
“It is important schools across East Anglia do more than just make statements and we must all commit to robustly reviewing existing practice and curricula, and support and challenge each other to increase the diversity in our workforce.
“This will ensure East Anglia is a leading example in the promotion of anti-racism and in the guarantee of an education system that is equitable for every pupil.”
Education leaders are invited to sign up as a member to the collective where they will benefit from a range of professional development modules and bespoke support tailored to their educational institution. The inaugural East Anglia Anti-Racism Education Collective virtual conference will take place on Tuesday 10th November.
The group has received very positive responses from local authorities across the region, many of whom are joining as members and offering subsidies to their schools to allow them to join. They have also offered to sponsor and host future events and conferences.
Professor Paul Miller, Principal Consultant & Director of Educational Equity Services, who has undertaken extensive research in the area of social justice in education, and racism and educational leadership, said: “From the outset of the East Anglia Anti-Racism Education Collective, our ambition is to talk about race openly and help each member and the group to develop a shared vocabulary and practice in anti-racism.
“We want to offer training and meaningful engagement activities in order to develop capacity and probe reflection for our membership at all levels.”
Tim Coulson, Chief Executive of the Unity Schools Partnership, added: “We want to engender and facilitate real and purposeful progress in the education of anti-racism across schools in our region. In decades’ time, when we look back at this pivotal moment for racial and social justice activism, we want each leader, each organisation and the EAAREC as a whole to be able to say, ‘I did something to challenge and stomp out racism’.”

BBC Children in Need: Joe Wicks and Laura Whitmore launch 2020 schools fundraising appeal – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Secondary schools', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources', 'Wellbeing']","November 3, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/bbc-children-in-need-joe-wicks-and-laura-whitmore-launch-2020-schools-fundraising-appeal/,"BBC Children in Need has announced Joe Wicks will be returning for the charity’s 2020 Appeal as the Schools Ambassador. Joe is leading this year’s primary schools campaign, ‘Five to Thrive’, which aims to unite children in schools across the UK in a week of activities to enhance their own wellbeing. In addition, Laura Whitmore lends her support to the charity’s schools fundraising appeal by asking secondary school pupils and teachers across the nation to ‘Come As You Are’ – by wearing what they feel makes them comfortable in aid of the charity. Schools are invited to download a fundraising pack from bbc.co.uk/Pudsey. Primary Schools who download a fundraising pack will enter a draw to win a special online workout with Joe Wicks.
The focus of this year’s primary schools campaign, ‘Five to Thrive’, is on supporting children’s mental wellbeing and resilience. Recent research commissioned by BBC Children in Need shows that the last six months have had a real impact on children and young people’s wellbeing. The nationwide survey of 831 parents and 697 children and young people respectively revealed that 94% of children and young people have had cause to feel worried, sad or anxious in the last six months, since the UK went into lockdown. Six months after lockdown, nearly half (45%) of parents feel that their child displays more feelings of worry or anxiety than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded.
The ‘Five to Thrive’ campaign is based on the 5 Ways to Wellbeing and will have five key themes: Connect, Take Notice, Get Active, Be Curious, and Give. In the run up to BBC Children in Need on 13 November, primary schools will be provided with video content from Joe Wicks and friends including Dr Radha Modgil every day of the Appeal week (beginning Monday 9 November), with a day dedicated to each of the Five to Thrive themes. The content will help children to learn new skills such as journaling and improve their mood through movement. Resources created to support learning and to offer daily activities will also be available from BBC Children in Need’s Official Education Partner, Twinkl. These free materials will be available for every primary school in the UK.
The primary schools campaign will also see the return of Joe’s extremely popular ‘PE with Joe’ especially for BBC Children in Need on the morning of the Appeal day, Friday 13 November, which will also mark an opportunity for primary schools to fundraise with a non-uniform day.
The secondary schools campaign, supported by Laura Whitmore, invites schools to host a ‘Come As Yourself Day’: a non-uniform day which will give pupils the opportunity to wear what makes them feel most confident. The campaign aims to help pupils recognise the qualities that make each of them special and unique and embrace each other’s differences whilst raising money for BBC Children in Need.
Last year’s campaign, led by Joe, is estimated to have reached 3m children in 17,000 schools throughout the UK. Speaking of the campaign, Joe Wicks said: “It’s brilliant to have the opportunity to make a difference to children and young people right across the UK who are feeling the effects of a challenging time over the last six months. I hope to see all of the schools across the nation get involved and help raise money so BBC Children in Need can continue to fund projects in communities all over the UK; many of these projects are likely just down the road from you, that continue to be a lifeline to children in need of support. Together, we can help local charities and projects continue their work in every corner of the UK.”
Speaking of the Secondary schools campaign, Laura Whitmore added: “I am urging secondary school pupils and teachers to celebrate their uniqueness and be true to themselves during Come As You Are Day. Sometimes I feel like I can’t be myself or that I should fit into a box, so for any secondary school pupils feeling the same, this special day will provide an opportunity to wear what they want and style their hair as they wish, all whilst raising much needed funds to support children and young people facing disadvantage in the UK.”

Cricket research partnership formed as a tool to boost student life chances – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'Sport & Play']","October 30, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/cricket-research-partnership-formed-as-a-tool-to-boost-student-life-chances/,"A new research programme launched by the Arundel Castle Cricket Foundation (ACCF) and Bohunt Education Trust (BET) aims to inform how cricket and the outdoors can support students struggling with disadvantage, anxiety, engagement and/or behaviour at secondary school. Funding for the project has kindly been provided by ACCF and by a grant from Ned’s Fund, which exists to support vocational activities for young people who find themselves lacking purpose in life.
Whilst studies have suggested that sport and outdoor education such as bushcraft have benefits to young people, the ambitious programme will look in detail at the types of intervention that work best for different profiles of student. The programme aims to allow targeted interventions to be developed so that students have greater chance to thrive at secondary school and beyond.
The timing of this programme is of further relevance given the increased risk to young people’s mental health posed by the current Covid19 pandemic, emphasising the need for alternative, creative programmes such as this to support young people both during and post this challenging period.
Beginning early in 2021, more than 230 students from the BET family of seven schools, plus Steyning Grammar School (soon to join BET) will be involved in a series of visits to ACCF’s incredible grounds, to take part in activities including: cricket coaching, bushcraft courses, health based activities, and visits to Arundel Castle and its gardens.
The activities will allow students to develop skills in resilience and self-confidence, which school staff will translate back into the classroom. Evaluation of the results will be completed by ImpactEd, a professional research organisation, so that all schools within and beyond BET can learn how best to ensure every child has an equal chance in school.
The new project will support BET’s ongoing work into the benefits of outdoor education and will ensure that curriculum policies are informed by the best possible research.
Neil Strowger, Trust Leader at BET said, “Outdoor activities and education can be life-changing experiences for many children. Some with very little confidence have gone on to be head boys and girls; others with little self-belief or who may have disengaged with school entirely have achieved excellent exam results and reached positive destinations.
“At BET, we welcome opportunities for collaboration and game-changing research. This programme breaks new ground by informing and giving us the chance to ensure that connections between student profiles and different types of outdoor activity intervention can be properly considered.”
Tim Shutt, Director of the Arundel Castle Cricket Foundation said: “Our education-rich surrounds here at Arundel are ideally suited to providing life-changing learning experiences to young people who may be facing some form of disadvantage or simply struggling with school. The need for interventions such as this, as we sit within a global pandemic, is as great as it has ever been.
“We are delighted to be forming this educational partnership with Bohunt Education Trust. They committed to innovative, “game-changing” outdoor education and their expertise will be crucial in delivering the desired outputs. In addition, we are incredibly grateful to Ned’s Fund, whose generosity has enabled us to deliver this potentially groundbreaking programme. Their ethos is very much aligned to ours and their passion to transform the lives of young people needing support is hugely inspiring.”",a new research programme launched by the arundel castle cricket foundation accf and bohunt education trust bet aim to inform how cricket and the outdoors can support student struggling with disadvantage anxiety engagement andor behaviour at secondary school funding for the project ha kindly been provided by accf and by a grant from neds fund which exists to support vocational activity for young people who find themselves lacking purpose in life whilst study have suggested that sport and outdoor education such a bushcraft have benefit to young people the ambitious programme will look in detail at the type of intervention that work best for different profile of student the programme aim to allow targeted intervention to be developed so that student have greater chance to thrive at secondary school and beyond the timing of this programme is of further relevance given the increased risk to young people mental health posed by the current covid pandemic emphasising the need for alternative creative programme such a this to support young people both during and post this challenging period beginning early in more than student from the bet family of seven school plus steyning grammar school soon to join bet will be involved in a series of visit to accfs incredible ground to take part in activity including cricket coaching bushcraft course health based activity and visit to arundel castle and it garden the activity will allow student to develop skill in resilience and selfconfidence which school staff will translate back into the classroom evaluation of the result will be completed by impacted a professional research organisation so that all school within and beyond bet can learn how best to ensure every child ha an equal chance in school the new project will support bet ongoing work into the benefit of outdoor education and will ensure that curriculum policy are informed by the best possible research neil strowger trust leader at bet said outdoor activity and education can be lifechanging experience for many child some with very little confidence have gone on to be head boy and girl others with little selfbelief or who may have disengaged with school entirely have achieved excellent exam result and reached positive destination at bet we welcome opportunity for collaboration and gamechanging research this programme break new ground by informing and giving u the chance to ensure that connection between student profile and different type of outdoor activity intervention can be properly considered tim shutt director of the arundel castle cricket foundation said our educationrich surround here at arundel are ideally suited to providing lifechanging learning experience to young people who may be facing some form of disadvantage or simply struggling with school the need for intervention such a this a we sit within a global pandemic is a great a it ha ever been we are delighted to be forming this educational partnership with bohunt education trust they committed to innovative gamechanging outdoor education and their expertise will be crucial in delivering the desired output in addition we are incredibly grateful to neds fund whose generosity ha enabled u to deliver this potentially groundbreaking programme their ethos is very much aligned to ours and their passion to transform the life of young people needing support is hugely inspiring,"['research', 'bushcraft', 'gamechanging', 'learning', 'classroom', 'education', 'student', 'cricket', 'coaching', 'educationrich']"
NewVIc launches new African Studies Centre to transform the teaching of black history in schools – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'Diversity', 'FE colleges', 'History', 'News', 'Resources', 'Social issues', 'Teaching resources']","October 29, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/newvic-launches-new-african-studies-centre-to-transform-the-teaching-of-black-history-in-schools/,"The new African Studies Centre, the first of its kind, will equip teachers with the skills and knowledge to teach students about the history of Africa, doing away with a tradition of learning about this diverse continent through the lens of European Colonialism.
The College has teamed up with world-class professors from leading universities to deliver a range of online sessions for teachers. In the sessions, teachers will receive training to teach medieval African kingdoms and explore a wide range of topic areas, for all key stages of students.
The online sessions will be a collaborative space where teachers from across the UK can exchange ideas and resources for teaching African history in secondary schools and sixth forms. The sessions are designed to broaden the parameters of the curriculum and students’ sense of British history, re-examining prevailing assumptions about national identity and belonging.
A principal goal will be to widen the scope of Black history that students are exposed to.
Traditionally, British schools have only taught African history through the perspective of European colonisation. The issue with such a narrow segment implies that Africa was ahistorical prior to European discovery, propagating a false perception that no noteworthy events, discoveries or civilisations occurred there.
The African Studies Centre hopes to challenge this narrative of Africa by exploring its history that predates Colonialism and explore how African civilisations recorded and told their own histories.
The idea of opening an African Studies Centre at the College was conceived by Carina Ancell and Alan Kunna, two history lecturers at NewVIc.
The pair identified the need for a specialist place whilst undertaking research for a book they are co-writing on Charlie Hutchinson, the only known Black British volunteer in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War.
Carina Ancell, History Lecturer and Honours Programme Manager at Newham Sixth Form College, said: “As far as we are aware there are not currently any schools or colleges in London offering a comprehensive super curricular African Studies programme. As such, this is a real opportunity to develop expertise amongst the capital’s teaching community whilst developing students’ interest in and appreciation of African history.”
Prior to choosing GCSE options, the National Curriculum dictates that in Key Stage 3, pupils should be taught a syllabus which enables them to “know and understand the history of these islands as a coherent, chronological narrative […] how people’s lives have shaped this nation and how Britain has influenced and been influenced by the wider world”.
In 2019, the Runnymede Trust found that despite the guidelines of the National Curriculum, there is considerable variability in how schools deliver lessons on British imperialism and post-colonial migration.
In addition to this, academies are not legally required to follow the National Curriculum, making it hard to determine how these topics are being explored with students.
A survey taken by the Trust, in conjunction with the Universities of Manchester and Cambridge, found that many teachers urgently wanted further support to bolster their confidence in exploring issues of empire and migration. 83% reported a desire for additional training on teaching about migration and 74% on teaching about empire.
The new African Studies Centre at NewVIc will provide a much-needed infrastructure of support so that more teachers are given the tools they need to tackle these subjects.
According to Carina Ancell, “All teachers, regardless of cultural background, must be encouraged to engage with this important section of history. We believe that it is really important that teachers who may not have a background or specialism in African history feel confident and supported in delivering materials on this topic.”
The hope is that the African Studies Centre will broaden the history taught in schools and change perceptions and public knowledge of what the history of the British people actually is.
Alan Kunna, History Lecturer and Foundation Learning Manager at Newham Sixth Form College, said: “We close down the possibility of being one people by ignoring others or disparaging their pasts which allows for division to exist and widen. Many Black and Asian students need to be encouraged to discover the relevance of their own histories in relation to current events in Britain today.”
The first session, The Issues with Teaching African History will be led by Toby Green, a senior lecturer in Lusophone African History at King’s College London, and will take place online on Wednesday 11 November at 5 pm.
All sessions are free and open to all teachers across the UK, prior registration is essential and available on the College’s website: www.newvic.ac.uk/african-studies-centre",the new african study centre the first of it kind will equip teacher with the skill and knowledge to teach student about the history of africa doing away with a tradition of learning about this diverse continent through the lens of european colonialism the college ha teamed up with worldclass professor from leading university to deliver a range of online session for teacher in the session teacher will receive training to teach medieval african kingdom and explore a wide range of topic area for all key stage of student the online session will be a collaborative space where teacher from across the uk can exchange idea and resource for teaching african history in secondary school and sixth form the session are designed to broaden the parameter of the curriculum and student sense of british history reexamining prevailing assumption about national identity and belonging a principal goal will be to widen the scope of black history that student are exposed to traditionally british school have only taught african history through the perspective of european colonisation the issue with such a narrow segment implies that africa wa ahistorical prior to european discovery propagating a false perception that no noteworthy event discovery or civilisation occurred there the african study centre hope to challenge this narrative of africa by exploring it history that predates colonialism and explore how african civilisation recorded and told their own history the idea of opening an african study centre at the college wa conceived by carina ancell and alan kunna two history lecturer at newvic the pair identified the need for a specialist place whilst undertaking research for a book they are cowriting on charlie hutchinson the only known black british volunteer in the international brigade during the spanish civil war carina ancell history lecturer and honour programme manager at newham sixth form college said a far a we are aware there are not currently any school or college in london offering a comprehensive super curricular african study programme a such this is a real opportunity to develop expertise amongst the capital teaching community whilst developing student interest in and appreciation of african history prior to choosing gcse option the national curriculum dictate that in key stage pupil should be taught a syllabus which enables them to know and understand the history of these island a a coherent chronological narrative … how people life have shaped this nation and how britain ha influenced and been influenced by the wider world in the runnymede trust found that despite the guideline of the national curriculum there is considerable variability in how school deliver lesson on british imperialism and postcolonial migration in addition to this academy are not legally required to follow the national curriculum making it hard to determine how these topic are being explored with student a survey taken by the trust in conjunction with the university of manchester and cambridge found that many teacher urgently wanted further support to bolster their confidence in exploring issue of empire and migration reported a desire for additional training on teaching about migration and on teaching about empire the new african study centre at newvic will provide a muchneeded infrastructure of support so that more teacher are given the tool they need to tackle these subject according to carina ancell all teacher regardless of cultural background must be encouraged to engage with this important section of history we believe that it is really important that teacher who may not have a background or specialism in african history feel confident and supported in delivering material on this topic the hope is that the african study centre will broaden the history taught in school and change perception and public knowledge of what the history of the british people actually is alan kunna history lecturer and foundation learning manager at newham sixth form college said we close down the possibility of being one people by ignoring others or disparaging their past which allows for division to exist and widen many black and asian student need to be encouraged to discover the relevance of their own history in relation to current event in britain today the first session the issue with teaching african history will be led by toby green a senior lecturer in lusophone african history at king college london and will take place online on wednesday november at pm all session are free and open to all teacher across the uk prior registration is essential and available on the college website,"['teach', 'online', 'manager', 'university', 'lecturer', 'principal', 'worldclass', 'teaching', 'professor', 'teacher']"
Positive Stories for Negative Times – the national project gifting free plays and resources to young people across the country garners large response in its first six weeks – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'Drama', 'News']","October 28, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/positive-stories-for-negative-times-the-national-project-gifting-free-plays-and-resources-to-young-people-across-the-country-garners-large-response-in-its-first-six-weeks/,"The latest project from Wonder Fools in association with Edinburgh’s Traverse Theatre, featuring in their unique digital Traverse Festival Programme has seen 107 groups from 51 schools, theatres and community groups across the UK sign up in just over six weeks since it was announced. The original aim to have 70 registered groups by the end of the seven-month project next March has already been surpassed and the numbers keep growing, demonstrative of the ongoing thirst for arts, culture and a sense of community as the challenges of 2020 continue.
The Glasgow theatre company has enlisted five of the UK’s most exciting playwrights to create a programme of plays to be gifted to young people – aged eight to 25 – across the country to perform and adapt as they wish, for free. Positive Stories for Negative Times is a direct response to the lack of physical spaces for young people to participate in creative activities currently, and the detrimental impact that this is having on their mental health and wellbeing.
Working with those from isolated areas, marginalised groups and vulnerable young people, Positive Stories for Negative Times is providing a new outlet to nurture creativity, encourage the exchange of new skills and ideas and provide a safe space online that could have a genuine impact on young people’s experience during the global pandemic.
Locations of those taking part so far includes Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dumfries and Galloway, Fife, Alloa, Mull, Aberdeen, Angus, Falkirk, West Lothian, East Lothian, Ayrshire, Dundee, Perth, North Berwick, London, Manchester, Oxford, Nottingham, Sussex, Northampton, Buxton, Malvern and Dorset. It has also garnered international interest with groups in Iceland and Oregon before it was officially announced.
Wonder Fools will provide a framework of how to rehearse, direct and record the works, with specific guidance on how to deliver the project in total lockdown, through blended learning or completely live in the space – a format that enables the work to continue despite changes in government guidelines. It’s entirely free and comes with a handbook that will help teachers and group leaders deliver the work whether that be live or remotely.
Suzie Lundy, curriculum leader of music and drama at Edinburgh’s Royal High School commented: “Positive Stories for Negative Times is a wonderful project providing a platform for young people’s creativity and engagement at a time when they need it most. The coronavirus pandemic has limited their lives and their opportunities through the impact of lockdown and ongoing restrictions, not least through the closures of theatres and other creative venues. The Wonder Fools project gives them back the chance to create their own work and engage with professionals in the industry. It is innovative and exciting in its design and we are thrilled to able to participate.”
Positive Stories for Negative Times runs through to March 2021, so there’s still plenty of time for new groups to register via the website now at positivestories.scot.

How owning a pet can teach your children valuable life lessons – Education Today,['News'],"October 27, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/how-owning-a-pet-can-teach-your-children-valuable-life-lessons/,"Dogs are a man’s best friend, but how about a boy or a girl’s best mate? What can the cat do to help your children do better at school? Will the presence of a rabbit’s floppy ears make your youngest become a better listener?
All questions you’ve probably never asked yourself or anyone else, but the truth is having pets in the home can teach your children some valuable and positive life lessons which they can carry forward into adulthood.
Here’s a glimpse into the wisdom your faithful pet could be passing on to the kids.
A sense of responsibility
You understand the burden of responsibility that comes with owning a pet. For example, the major financial responsibility that comes with purchasing and maintaining a healthy animal, and the rigours of its exercise routine, feeding times and so on and so forth.
That financial responsibility stretches over the animal’s lifetime, so make sure you check your finances before going ahead and adding a new member to your family.
While your children might not get absolutely all of the background stuff that goes on with keeping a pet, they can gauge the sense of responsibility required to look after a loved one. You can help them learn by giving them age-appropriate tasks, such as getting little ones to look for when the dog’s water bowl is empty or letting older children to help with the feeding process.
Learning compassion and enhancing communication
Most household pets are highly emotionally intelligent animals. Dogs in particular display their heart on their sleeve best, and day-to-day interaction with animals can help teach your kids the basics of compassion and communication.
Understanding when a pet is happy or sad, excited or angry, in distress or wants something; this is all based on learning your pet’s behaviours and actions. Just like you, the kids will get to understand this better as time goes on, understanding the limits of communication in play and learning to work around it to develop a better relationship.

Reducing stress and behavioural issues
Studies have shown that children of families with pets generally have better health, are more active and struggle less with behavioural and learning issues, not to mention are generally less moody, too. This, however, is likely down to better socio-economic circumstances rather than the animals themselves, but the use of animals as therapy pets suggest there is a stress reduction, and therefore behavioural improvement attached directly to owning a pet.
Encouraging a healthy lifestyle
Owning a pet is fun, but it’s also pretty tiring at points, so why not let the kids take over with the exercise elements from time to time. Whether that’s them accompanying you out walking the dog on a day or running around with the cat in the living room, owning a pet that needs to stay active encourages your kids to do the same.
When people come to get a pet, the psychological benefits one would provide for their children probably isn’t the top reason for getting one. There is, however, a lot of evidence to say that owning a pet can help your children develop some fundamental life skills – which is an added bonus to have a cute cuddle companion around at all times.",dog are a man best friend but how about a boy or a girl best mate what can the cat do to help your child do better at school will the presence of a rabbit floppy ear make your youngest become a better listener all question youve probably never asked yourself or anyone else but the truth is having pet in the home can teach your child some valuable and positive life lesson which they can carry forward into adulthood here a glimpse into the wisdom your faithful pet could be passing on to the kid a sense of responsibility you understand the burden of responsibility that come with owning a pet for example the major financial responsibility that come with purchasing and maintaining a healthy animal and the rigour of it exercise routine feeding time and so on and so forth that financial responsibility stretch over the animal lifetime so make sure you check your finance before going ahead and adding a new member to your family while your child might not get absolutely all of the background stuff that go on with keeping a pet they can gauge the sense of responsibility required to look after a loved one you can help them learn by giving them ageappropriate task such a getting little one to look for when the dog water bowl is empty or letting older child to help with the feeding process learning compassion and enhancing communication most household pet are highly emotionally intelligent animal dog in particular display their heart on their sleeve best and daytoday interaction with animal can help teach your kid the basic of compassion and communication understanding when a pet is happy or sad excited or angry in distress or want something this is all based on learning your pet behaviour and action just like you the kid will get to understand this better a time go on understanding the limit of communication in play and learning to work around it to develop a better relationship reducing stress and behavioural issue study have shown that child of family with pet generally have better health are more active and struggle le with behavioural and learning issue not to mention are generally le moody too this however is likely down to better socioeconomic circumstance rather than the animal themselves but the use of animal a therapy pet suggest there is a stress reduction and therefore behavioural improvement attached directly to owning a pet encouraging a healthy lifestyle owning a pet is fun but it also pretty tiring at point so why not let the kid take over with the exercise element from time to time whether thats them accompanying you out walking the dog on a day or running around with the cat in the living room owning a pet that need to stay active encourages your kid to do the same when people come to get a pet the psychological benefit one would provide for their child probably isnt the top reason for getting one there is however a lot of evidence to say that owning a pet can help your child develop some fundamental life skill which is an added bonus to have a cute cuddle companion around at all time,"['mate', 'family', 'household', 'valuable', 'youngest', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'dog', 'home', 'daytoday']"
Rare Breeds Survival Trust awards first ever RBST Education Accreditation – Education Today,"['Careers', 'England', 'Environmental Focus', 'Further Education', 'News']","October 27, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/rare-breeds-survival-trust-awards-first-ever-rbst-education-accreditation/,"Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) has awarded RBST accreditation to three new organisations, welcoming them to the expanded RBST Farm Park Accreditation Network. The first ever RBST Education accreditation has been awarded to Merrist Wood College in Surrey.
The charity is extending its Accreditation Network to include, for the first time, education establishments and other institutions that meet the RBST’s criteria for work supporting the conservation of native breeds of livestock and equines. They join the existing network of 21 RBST accredited farm parks and city farms across the UK.
RBST is the national charity that works to secure the future of rare breeds of native livestock and equines. The new RBST accreditations have been received in October 2020 by:

Merrist Wood College, Surrey: a multi-award winning 400 acre ‘outdoor classroom’, recipient of the first ever RBST Education accreditation.
Acton Scott Historic Working Farm, Shropshire: well-known as the setting of the BBC’s Victorian Farm series, and recipient of RBST Farm Park accreditation.
Almond Valley Heritage Centre, Livingston: a social enterprise that combines a museum, farm and discovery centre, and recipient of RBST Farm Park accreditation.

To become RBST accredited they have each fulfilled a set of criteria including participation in conservation breeding programmes and promoting the benefits of native breeds.
RBST Chief Executive Christopher Price says: “The expansion of the RBST Accreditation Network has great potential for rare breed conservation work. As well as opening up new breeding opportunities and encouraging a wider network for stock exchange, it will extend the reach of our crucial rare breed survival message and increase the opportunity to share experiences and techniques.
“The RBST accredited organisations do important work through rare breed conservation programmes, scientific research and public engagement. I am delighted to welcome Merrist Wood College, Acton Scott and Almond Valley to the network of RBST Accredited organisations and I look forward to working with them for the survival of our rare native breeds.”
Merrist Wood College
The college’s 400-acre estate features woodlands, wetlands, livestock, gardens and grasslands, as well as a specialist animal management centre. The College’s rare breeds conservation programme supports Portland sheep, Wensleydale sheep, Oxford Sandy & Black pigs, Golden Guernsey goats and rare breeds of poultry.
Luke Gates, Head of Animal Collections at Merrist Wood said: “The RBST is an organisation that we have been passionate about supporting for many years with our first rare breeds arriving at Merrist Wood in 2000. Over the last 7 years we have been serious about developing our rare breeds for teaching and learning and supporting the RBST. We now have ten different breeds who are in need of protection due to low numbers. Many people know about giant pandas and various rhino species needing conservation support, but many of our own native livestock breeds are actually more rare.”
Charlie Dodd, Farm Manager at Merrist Wood added: “This year the RBST is running a campaign called Love a Longwool which is what really spurred us on to become RBST accredited this year. To become the first ever Education Facility rare breeds farm under their new framework is fantastic news for the Activate Learning group. We have just scanned our rare breeds sheep and are excited to announce all are pregnant and with the help of the RBST we look forward to do our part in conserving these breeds.”
Acton Scott Historic Working Farm
Acton Scott Historic Working Farm, which was the first historic working farm of its kind, specialises in practical demonstrations of historic farming using traditional skills and period horse-drawn machines. The rare breeds conservation programme at Acton Scott includes Original Population Dairy Shorthorn cattle, Gloucester Old Spot pigs, Shropshire sheep and rare breeds of poultry.
Sarah Green, Facilities Manager at Acton Scott said: “We are very proud at Acton Scott to have been awarded with RBST Accreditation as our animals are not only beautiful, they are also a vital part of our social history. It is wonderful to be able to share their importance with a wider audience.”
Almond Valley Heritage Centre
Almond Valley is set either side of the River Almond and home to the historic Livingston Mill. It’s conservation programme supports rare breeds including Clydesdale horses, Tamworth pigs, North Ronaldsay sheep, Bagot goats, Golden Guernsey goats and rare breeds of poultry.
Craig Holmes, Farm Manager at Almond Valley Discovery Centre, said: “Almond Valley Heritage Centre are delighted to have become an RBST accredited Farm Park, a lot of hard work has gone into the farm over the last 18 months so it is great to be rewarded with this highly sought after accreditation. We are committed to the conservation of rare breeds, and inspiring our visitors to have an interest in Britain’s native rare breeds. It is fantastic to be central Scotland’s only ‘RBST Accredited Farm Park’ an approved conservation centre, acting as a hub for members of the public to visit and see native breeds conservation in action, with only one other in Scotland. We look forward to working with the RBST and its members, to help save some of Britain’s rarest native farm stock.”",rare breed survival trust rbst ha awarded rbst accreditation to three new

Pupils encourage kindness in the community – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'Coronavirus', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Scotland', 'Social issues']","October 26, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/pupils-encourage-kindness-in-the-community/,"Primary school pupils at The Glasgow Academy’s Milngavie campus are inspiring hope and kindness within their community, as a new round of Covid-19 restrictions are announced.
The ‘Little Notes of Kindness’ campaign has been launched by the Prep 4 class to keep spirits up ahead of what is set to be a challenging and difficult winter.
Pupils will write to elderly residents at Abbotsford House who have been forced to shield during the ongoing pandemic, as well as those in the Milngavie Friendship Circle – a local group who would normally meet once a week in Milngavie town hall.
The children are also calling for all Scots to support the campaign by distributing their own little notes of kindness throughout their local community.
Jean McMorran, Head Teacher at The Glasgow Academy’s Milngavie campus, said: “This has been an incredibly tough year for everyone and we have been working hard to return to some resemblance of normality.
“In times of hardship, we must look after each other and should do all we can to support the most vulnerable within our communities. This is an important message which we teach our pupils.
“Just a few kind words can bring so much joy to a person’s day, and if we can inspire even just one smile then the campaign has been a success.
“The children have been wonderful during the initial nationwide lockdown and quickly adapted to home-learning with a positive attitude. Hopefully their sense of optimism and cheerful nature can be spread with some little notes of kindness.”

An easy guide to the UK’s Student Visa Process – Education Today,['News'],"October 22, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/an-easy-guide-to-the-uks-student-visa-process/,"If you are student looking to study in the UK, the following guide is your holy grail:
All international students, including those from EU/EEA and Switzerland currently require a student visa to pursue their undergraduate and postgraduate studies in the region. Essentially, there are three types of student visas that one can opt for in the UK and these include:

Short-term Study Visa: This is a six month long visa for students above 18 years of age opting for enrollment into a short course
Child Student Visa: This is for students below 18 years of age opting for enrollment in an independent school
Student Visa: This is for students above the age of 16 opting for enrollment in university

Students can begin their visa application process three months prior to the start of their coursework in their respective institution. They must submit their application on the British government’s official website, and the average student visa application process requires six basic components:

A valid passport
A recent picture
An offer of enrollment and acceptance from respective institution
A document proof of English language skills
A document proof of financial support and assistance
A probable test for tuberculosis and/or self-isolation upon arrival

Students ought to be careful while processing their visa application and the following tips can come in handy:

Owing to Brexit, the visa process for the UK could potentially see changes in he 2021, and students ought to be on the lookout.
Students ought to ensure that the institution that they are accepted to is licensed with the UK government
Students ought to consult trained visa advisors at universities or get in touch with student visa immigration solicitors to make the process stress-free
Students ought to remain pro-active and make necessary preparations for their application process well in time to avoid any mishaps.

Owing to UK’s political climate and the probable tightening around UK’s student visa regulations, students ought to exercise caution, and follow the listed below DON’TS:

Don’t Lie: This is a no-brainer, but students often tend to forge documents in a positive light to guarantee acceptance. Lying or submitting a fraudulent application should be avoided at all costs as not only would it threaten your application, but also hold you accountable in the eyes of law.
Don’t be a rebel: This goes to say that students ought to follow all rules that guide their visa status – both before and after acceptance. Overstaying or working if not permitted are not recommended courses of action as they could pose a severe penalty and the student be charged legally.
Don’t be ambiguous: Any ambiguity or room for confusion could further delay the application process when you could already be on a short notice. If the officer in-charge has to call you multiple times to review or get clarification on your application, it indicates to them that you did not do thorough research or given enough thought – which is always a bad sign.

That’s that: Get to work and complete your application on time!",if you are student looking to study in the uk the following guide is your holy grail all international student including those from eueea and switzerland currently require a student visa to pursue their undergraduate and postgraduate study in the region essentially there are three type of student visa that one can opt for in the uk and these include shortterm study visa this is a six month long visa for student above year of age opting for enrollment into a short course child student visa this is for student below year of age opting for enrollment in an independent school student visa this is for student above the age of opting for enrollment in university student can begin their visa application process three month prior to the start of their coursework in their respective institution they must submit their application on the british government official website and the average student visa application process requires six basic component a valid passport a recent picture an offer of enrollment and acceptance from respective institution a document proof of english language skill a document proof of financial support and assistance a probable test for tuberculosis andor selfisolation upon arrival student ought to be careful while processing their visa application and the following tip can come in handy owing to brexit the visa process for the uk could potentially see change in he and student ought to be on the lookout student ought to ensure that the institution that they are accepted to is licensed with the uk government student ought to consult trained visa advisor at university or get in touch with student visa immigration solicitor to make the process stressfree student ought to remain proactive and make necessary preparation for their application process well in time to avoid any mishap owing to uk political climate and the probable tightening around uk student visa regulation student ought to exercise caution and follow the listed below donts dont lie this is a nobrainer but student often tend to forge document in a positive light to guarantee acceptance lying or submitting a fraudulent application should be avoided at all cost a not only would it threaten your application but also hold you accountable in the eye of law dont be a rebel this go to say that student ought to follow all rule that guide their visa status both before and after acceptance overstaying or working if not permitted are not recommended course of action a they could pose a severe penalty and the student be charged legally dont be ambiguous any ambiguity or room for confusion could further delay the application process when you could already be on a short notice if the officer incharge ha to call you multiple time to review or get clarification on your application it indicates to them that you did not do thorough research or given enough thought which is always a bad sign thats that get to work and complete your application on time,"['immigration', 'tuberculosis', 'passport', 'coursework', 'visa', 'student', 'switzerland', 'university', 'undergraduate', 'brexit']"

The Green Flag is the highest achievement given by Eco-Schools – a global programme which works to empower children and teenagers, to improve the environment and give them an environmental voice.
St Edmund Campion, on Tewkesbury Close, received the Green Flag Award for its environmental activities over the last five years, which were decided on and delivered by the school’s own Eco Council, made up of elected pupils from each class.
The Eco Council – led by teacher Mrs Hyland-Taylor – has worked tirelessly to meet the strict criteria of the Green Flag Award by adopting eco-friendly initiatives to reduce the school’s carbon footprint.
Following its accreditation, St Edmund Campion School – which featured in The Sunday Times’ Top 500 list of primary schools for 2020 – has been awarded the Green Flag to fly at the school, as well as a letter and certificate celebrating the pupil’s success.
The pupil’s sustainable activities included building a full-sized greenhouse from recycled plastic bottles, conducting litter-picks, managing the school’s allotment with the support of horticulturalist, Sarah Taylor, reducing unnecessary electricity usage by checking lights were switched off and collecting batteries to prevent them entering landfill.
They also hosted charitable giving events such as clothing collections for the Samaritans and donating loved but not worn-out shoes to charity Sals Shoes.
Mrs Hyland-Taylor, said: “I was overjoyed to receive confirmation that the school had been awarded the Green Flag. It is a testament to the pupils that have pushed forward their ideas to improve the way we look after and appreciate our environment. I cannot wait to see the school continue to flourish as we go from strength to strength in this area.
“The Eco-Schools programme is a wonderful example of an initiative that has a real impact on young people’s lives and the environment, and we at St Edmund Campion take pride in teaching pupils about the importance of a sustainable world.
“It’s been wonderful to see our students so passionate and engaged as part of these activities. Well done to them and to all the other schools who have achieved the Green Flag.”
Prior to obtaining the Green Flag Award, all schools must first acquire the Eco-Schools’ Bronze and Silver Awards, which St Edmund Campion achieved in 2017.
To determine the school’s eligibility for the Green Flag Award, St Edmund Campion had to be assessed by an Eco-Schools delivery officer, which was then followed by a visit from assessor to observe and celebrate the great sustainable work that St Edmund Campion had completed.
Eco-Schools is engaging 19.5 million children across 67 countries, making it the largest educational programme in the world.

A world first in Cambridge: IB special autism school to open in 2021 – Education Today,"['Behaviour & Special Needs', 'Mental health', 'News', 'SEND', 'State schools', 'Wellbeing']","October 21, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/a-world-first-in-cambridge-ib-special-autism-school-to-open-in-2021/,"The Cavendish School, the world’s first International Baccalaureate (IB) special autism school is set to open on the outskirts of Cambridge in Autumn 2021. Based in Impington, The Cavendish School will also be Cambridgeshire’s first state maintained special free school provision for young people with autism.
Initially admitting up to 40 students in Years 3 to 7, intake at the school will grow year on year, to a maximum capacity of 80 students from Year 3 to 13. The Cavendish School will be accessible and available to many families who cannot be catered for within current state provision in the county.
Ryan Kelsall, Deputy CEO of The Learning Alliance – a new multi-academy trust of which The Cavendish School is a member – said: “We are absolutely thrilled to be able to announce the plans for The Cavendish School to the public. Through our bespoke curriculum and teaching methodology, we will provide the educational environment that young people with autism need to thrive and succeed when their needs cannot be met in a mainstream school.
“The Cavendish School will celebrate diversity and accept, respect and recognise neurological and developmental differences to support each individual student through a differentiated programme that builds and focuses on their skills. Through the knowledge and expertise of The Learning Alliance, The Cavendish School will deliver exemplary education provision for students with Educational Health Care Plans.”
The first of its kind, The Cavendish School will be an IB World School, which means that it will follow the IB programmes and accredited qualifications, alongside specific therapies or interventions as appropriate for individuals. In an ever-changing world, the IB equips students with the skills, confidence and lifelong learning needed to thrive and make a difference. Each of the programme frameworks allows teachers to personalise learning to the unique abilities of their students.
Leah Cooper, Assistant Principal for SEND/PP and SENCo at the co-located Impington Village College, currently seconded to The Cavendish School, said: “Through our IB offering, we will provide our students with the skills and knowledge they need to become globally aware citizens, achieve a range of accredited qualifications and make measurable progress towards their own personal outcomes. Our individualised approach will ensure that we are offering the support and guidance needed to all who study with us, as well as helping families throughout the process. We will be drawing upon the success of our co-located mainstream schools (Impington Village College and Impington International College) to provide excellent opportunities for the students, through shared use of support staff and bespoke extra-curricular activities.”
At the heart of The Cavendish School will be relationships and the important ways in which they can support the growth of each student. Throughout the planning stages for the school, the team has drawn on the latest research into autism and used its expertise in education and experience of working with young people with autism and their families. Beyond high-quality teaching, therapeutic support will be offered, so that all students have full access to the curriculum, to learn and to achieve. The Cavendish School will offer students the opportunity for multidisciplinary support, which will be carefully matched to the explicit needs of the individual student.
Julie Bailey, Chair of Governors at The Cavendish School and doctoral researcher at the Faculty of Education within the University of Cambridge, said: “The Cavendish School aspires to remove the barriers to inclusion and achievement that many young people with autism face in their education. We’ve built on the best of current provision and the very latest research throughout the design and planning stages. The Cavendish School is set to have a transformative impact, giving its pupils an educational environment in which they will thrive.”",the cavendish school the world first international baccalaureate ib special autism school is set to open on the outskirt of cambridge in autumn based in impington the cavendish school will also be cambridgeshires first state maintained special free school provision for young people with autism initially admitting up to student in year to intake at the school will grow year on year to a maximum capacity of student from year to the cavendish school will be accessible and available to many family who can not be catered for within current state provision in the county ryan kelsall deputy ceo of the learning alliance a new multiacademy trust of which the cavendish school is a member said we are absolutely thrilled to be able to announce the plan for the cavendish school to the public through our bespoke curriculum and teaching methodology we will provide the educational environment that young people with autism need to thrive and succeed when their need can not be met in a mainstream school the cavendish school will celebrate diversity and accept respect and recognise neurological and developmental difference to support each individual student through a differentiated programme that build and focus on their skill through the knowledge and expertise of the learning alliance the cavendish school will deliver exemplary education provision for student with educational health care plan the first of it kind the cavendish school will be an ib world school which mean that it will follow the ib programme and accredited qualification alongside specific therapy or intervention a appropriate for individual in an everchanging world the ib equips student with the skill confidence and lifelong learning needed to thrive and make a difference each of the programme framework allows teacher to personalise learning to the unique ability of their student leah cooper assistant principal for sendpp and senco at the colocated impington village college currently seconded to the cavendish school said through our ib offering we will provide our student with the skill and knowledge they need to become globally aware citizen achieve a range of accredited qualification and make measurable progress towards their own personal outcome our individualised approach will ensure that we are offering the support and guidance needed to all who study with u a well a helping family throughout the process we will be drawing upon the success of our colocated mainstream school impington village college and impington international college to provide excellent opportunity for the student through shared use of support staff and bespoke extracurricular activity at the heart of the cavendish school will be relationship and the important way in which they can support the growth of each student throughout the planning stage for the school the team ha drawn on the latest research into autism and used it expertise in education and experience of working with young people with autism and their family beyond highquality teaching therapeutic support will be offered so that all student have full access to the curriculum to learn and to achieve the cavendish school will offer student the opportunity for multidisciplinary support which will be carefully matched to the explicit need of the individual student julie bailey chair of governor at the cavendish school and doctoral researcher at the faculty of education within the university of cambridge said the cavendish school aspires to remove the barrier to inclusion and achievement that many young people with autism face in their education weve built on the best of current provision and the very latest research throughout the design and planning stage the cavendish school is set to have a transformative impact giving it pupil an educational environment in which they will thrive,"['student', 'autumn', 'new', 'education', 'teacher', 'university', 'cambridge', 'ceo', 'doctoral', 'autism']"

Ocean Conservation Trust launches world first ocean lessons and virtual tours for schools – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Environmental Focus', 'KS1', 'KS2', 'National Curriculum', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Resources', 'Student engagement', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","October 16, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/ocean-conservation-trust-launch-world-first-ocean-lessons-and-virtual-tours-for-schools/,"Ocean conservation charity, the Ocean Conservation Trust – which also runs the much-loved National Marine Aquarium (the UK’s largest aquarium) – has launched an exciting curriculum learning project. For 22 years, the Ocean Conservation Trust has been providing an exciting and engaging learning programme, using the Ocean as a hook for teachers to deliver all subjects of the curriculum. The programme is co-created with teachers and comprises sessions and workshops that support curriculum-based learning at all key stages and abilities. The aim is to help people become ocean literate and #ThinkOcean.
Teachers can download self-contained lessons featuring video and resources, which link to the primary science curriculum and uses the Ocean as a tool for exploring the curriculum. The lessons are totally accessible and easy for teachers to use and have been piloted through the Connect Academy Trust.
In addition, the Ocean Conservation Trust is launching virtual tours, where visitors can virtually pass between the three distinct zones of the aquarium; the first covering local coasts and rockpool shallows and marine life that’s found slightly off shore; the second exhibits the inhabitants of the Atlantic Ocean, where some of the aquarium’s biggest animals live – such as the sharks and turtles; and the third region covering the tropical reefs – with familiar favourites Nemo and Dory – as well as follow up science activities, there are follow up art and literacy activities; all of which will be evaluated to see what learning has taken place. The tours will be given by marine biologists and scientists, working with trained teachers and youth workers who also have marine science qualifications.
The Ocean Conservation Trust is offering these virtual tours so that pupils all over the UK have the chance to learn about the Ocean. Living in the UK, no one is ever further than 70 miles from sea, but these virtual guides and lessons mean distance is not an issue. Next year sees the start of the UN Decade of the Ocean and the virtual tours and lesson plans are aimed to get the UK off to flying start. Alongside the tour, activities and lesson plans are offered as a package bundle giving users up to 2- or 3-days’ worth of activities and homework.
The virtual tours will be bespoke – and the National Marine Aquarium is the only aquarium in the world offering this – where one class or potentially two will be taken on an hour and a half virtual tour, which is the same length as an in-person tour. The class will be taken around the aquarium, work interactively and the children will have the opportunity to ask questions as if they were really in the aquarium.
The resources will also be updated every term, so what is in place for the autumn term will be updated for the spring term, with the charity reinvesting the money into the project. Ahead of the launch a teacher survey was conducted to see what was wanted from the learning packages and the tours and plans will be continually updated with any feedback. The only equipment needed at the schools’ end is a projector – and speakers ideally – basically what teachers would usually use to show a film to the class.
The Ocean Conservation Trust is not only concerned with general conservation – the charity wants to help educate and is aware that teachers are looking for things to support them in the classroom; how to make the curriculum interesting – particularly over the coming months when travel and school trips will be limited.

New toolkit to help London schools tackle poverty – Education Today,"['News', 'Primary schools', 'Resources', 'Secondary schools', 'Social issues', 'Support materials']","October 15, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/13364-2/,"With child poverty likely to rise sharply as the UK enters a coronavirus recession, Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) and Greater London Authority (GLA) have produced a practical toolkit to help London schools tackle poverty in the classroom.
Figures released earlier this week show the capital’s child poverty rate had reached 39%, even before the pandemic. It is the UK region with the highest child poverty rate. The pandemic is likely to make these figures much worse, with some estimates suggesting that 200,000 more children in the UK will be growing up in families living under the poverty line by the end of 2020.
Tackling child poverty: a guide for schools provides practical lessons and tips for schools on how to prevent and mitigate the worst effects of child poverty, to help London children living in poverty thrive in the school environment and get the most out of learning.
Drawing on examples and evidence from innovative programmes that are working well in some schools, the guide makes the case for ‘extended schools’: services that go beyond the classroom education of children, such as homework clubs, additional classes for disadvantaged children, sporting and cultural enrichment activities, before- and after-school childcare, holiday childcare and play provision.
The guide contains ideas and tips on how schools can:

find out what support children and parents need and actively promote services to families, such as claiming free schools meals and other financial support
bring down the financial barriers to learning, for example by reviewing and addressing the costs of uniforms, school trips, and subject costs
make the most of their local community and work with private and voluntary sector organisations to pool resources
establish practical partnerships with other organisations to bring in expertise and support services for parents, such as adult education, immigration advice and employment support.

The guide is being released this week as part of London Challenge Poverty Week, a week of joint action against poverty by organisations working alongside low-income families in the capital. London Challenge Poverty Week runs from 12 to 18 October.
The guide features examples from schools which have successfully taken steps to tackle child poverty:
One school featured in the guide established a community space on land attached to a new nearby housing development, which will include a community garden where children and parents can grow food and cook together. The school has also partnered with a football club, so that children can use its facilities.
Another school highlighted in the guide established partnerships with a number of external organisations to support children and parents living in poverty, and invites them to run workshops in the school and speak at parent events. Partner organisations include a counselling service and agencies with expertise in welfare rights and immigration issues.
A primary school started hosting information and advice sessions for parents focusing on financial and employment support, as part of a wider goal to increase children’s attendance at extended school activities. The school also surveyed pupils directly using a child-friendly electronic survey to understand their views on out-of-school provision and help ensure finance was not a barrier to taking part.
Alison Garnham, Chief Executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: “Many schools in London are already providing families in need with emergency help and food, but some schools want to go beyond this kind of emergency help and do more to routinely support children and parents. Our guide aims to inform these schools and offer them practical advice. We recognise that schools are managing heavy workloads and facing many challenges due to Covid-19; and ultimately it is for Governments, not schools, to prevent poverty. But small actions can improve children’s experience of school and allow them to engage more fully with education. Londoners want every child to have the chance to reach their potential but the pandemic is likely to see more of the capital’s children fall below the poverty line. Now more than ever, schools have a crucial role to play to protect London’s children from the potentially lifelong effects of poverty.”
Dr Debbie Weekes-Bernard, Deputy Mayor for Social Integration, Social Mobility and Community Engagement, Greater London Authority, said: “Every child has the right to a good education but for children living in poverty, key elements of school life – from going on trips to taking part in clubs – incur unmanageable costs.
“The coronavirus pandemic has shone a light on the deep inequalities in our society and it is increasingly clear that it is the households and families with the least who are suffering most.
“This report offers schools practical guidance on how to better support low-income families, empowering teachers to consider alternate ways of organising learning and enabling all children, whatever their background to achieve their very best at school.”

Science Quality Mark awarded to primary academy in West Yorkshire – Education Today,"['Awards', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Science', 'STEM', 'Student engagement']","October 14, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/science-quality-mark-awarded-to-primary-academy-in-west-yorkshire/,"Batley based Birstall Primary Academy has received the PSQM GILT award after its efforts and sustained improvements in raising the profile of science across its whole school community.
The GILT is awarded to those schools who have clearly established science leadership, successful teacher autonomy and innovation, development into science teaching and learning, and has shown a positive impact across all year groups.
In the feedback received, the school were praised for its ‘enriched’ subject experience and for its initiatives such as its science ambassadors’ and science club which were oversubscribed due to pupil popularity.
The school’s efforts to engrain science wider than the classroom has also been commended after the school facilitated a dedicated parent and pupil project and have supported parents in carrying out investigations and experiments from home during the coronavirus lockdown period.
This continued professional development programme has seen the school bolster its already successful science programme and as schools return in the next academic year, the teaching staff want to increase science capital with dedicated career learning sessions.
The school is amongst 160 schools from across the country who have received this prestigious accreditation.
Associate Professor Jane Turner, PSQM National Director said: “Schools that have achieved a Primary Science Quality Mark have demonstrated a significant commitment to science teaching and learning, even at this challenging time for schools.
“Children are engaging with great science both in and outside the classroom, developing positive attitudes towards science as well as secure scientific understanding and skills.
“Science subject leaders, their colleagues, head teachers, children, parents and governors should be very proud.”
Jayde Weir, Vice Principal at Birstall Primary Academy and lead on the project commented: “Thanks to the collective hard work of our dedicated staff throughout the school we have been able to enhance our science curriculum and begin to not just make this part of our school culture, but the wider communities too.
“We’ve had some excellent feedback from parents with children teaching younger siblings what they have learnt in the classroom which shows their level of engagement and enthusiasm for science.

Military charity launches free secondary school resources to support service children in school – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Community engagement', 'KS3', 'KS4', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Resources', 'Secondary schools', 'Social issues', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","October 13, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/military-charity-launches-free-secondary-school-resources-to-support-service-children-in-school/,"Little Troopers, the military children’s charity, has launched new secondary school resources to help teachers support children aged 11-16 who have parents serving in the British Armed Forces.
Created alongside teachers, forces families and behavioural experts, the resources offer lots of practical ideas to get children talking about forces life in school and can be used by any secondary school with service children – be that one service child or two hundred.
According to research from the charity, 96% of military parents would like schools to offer more specific support for military children and 38% said that moving school was an aspect of military life that their child struggled with the most. Other challenges faced by service children include being regularly separated from their serving parent, living away from extended family and moving home frequently.
The Little Troopers Secondary School Resource Hub is available on the Little Troopers website where education settings can now explore and download any of the lesson plans, activity templates and teacher training information. As well as one-off military-themed lessons and activity templates covering creative writing, sports activities, events, media skills, community engagement suggestions and more, the charity will also be adding details of how to set up a Forces Life Club in school.
In addition, the charity will be launching a secondary school Military Child Wellbeing Course template later this term and schools can now apply to receive this in the post. The six-session wellbeing course provides targeted early intervention and wellbeing support for all military children, not just those in crisis, and covers the topics of separation, deployment, house moves and living abroad, as well as the personal themes of belonging, identity and mindfulness. The course template includes everything schools need to deliver the course including a slide deck, facilitator notes, invitations, props and print-outs as well as everything on a USB.
The course can be integrated into schools’ existing wellbeing strategy and gives forces children the opportunity to explore specific themes and issues associated with military life. The aim is to empower all military children with positive strategies that they can use to cope with any challenges they face due to having a parent serving in the Armed Forces.
Little Troopers already has a Primary School Resource Pack and Primary School Wellbeing Course which are now used in hundreds of primary schools across the UK.
Louise Fetigan, founder of Little Troopers, comments: “As a charity, we think it is really important that military children feel recognised and included in school and are given the opportunity to talk about military life and share their experiences with their peers. The Secondary Resource Hub is packed with lots of practical and fun ways to do this. Meanwhile the Military Child Wellbeing Course template offers more targeted wellbeing support for military children in school to make sure they have the tools to cope with some of the more challenging aspects of forces life such as being separated from their serving parent and moving home and school frequently.
“We’ve wanted to create these resources for a really long time and we are very grateful to The Armed Forces Covenant Fund who have provided us with a £15,000 grant to enable us to make these secondary resources free to all schools.”

Calling all budding mini MasterChefs! – Education Today,"['Catering & Nutrition', 'Competition', 'Educational event', 'KS1', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools']","October 12, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/calling-all-budding-mini-masterchefs/,"Children’s food and farming education initiative Kids Country have announced the launch of their annual Winter Warmer Soup Challenge, which this year will be judged by MasterChef 2018 finalist, Simon Spooner.
Simon is an award-winning private chef who reached the top 10 of MasterChef in 2018 and now runs the private catering and events company Knife Fork and Spooner based near Stamford, Lincolnshire. Simon commented: “The Kids Country Winter Warmer Soup Challenge covers many things that are close to my heart, helping school children become more at home with great seasonal British produce and learning important nutrition and cooking skills.”
The annual cooking competition gives primary schools the opportunity to win a £200 first prize for their school – jointly donated between Central England Co-operative and Kids Country – as well as the coveted Winter Warmer Soup Challenge Trophy and a behind the scenes visit to a local farm, subject to Covid-19 restrictions.
Sandra Lauridsen, education manager for Kids Country, the East of England Agricultural Society’s education programme, says: “We are thrilled that we can still run our popular cooking challenge this winter, despite the restrictions that the Covid-19 pandemic has put on so many activities for children this year. We are grateful to Simon for joining the competition as our head judge, and he will be cooking up the three finalists’ recipes at the final stage of the competition. We hope that the Winter Warmer Soup Challenge will give primary schools an opportunity to not only engage with seasonal British produce, but also that it will be something that children can really put their imagination into.”

TV presenters give their support to school trips – Education Today,"['News', 'School Trips', 'Wellbeing']","October 9, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/tv-presenters-give-their-support-to-school-trips/,"TV presenters and adventurers Paul Rose and Kate Humble have given their support to school visits as a generation of young people risk missing out on these experiences. Due to Covid19 restrictions, there has been a dramatic decrease in school groups undertaking educational visits. This is impacting on the educational opportunities available to children and is threatening the survival of those organisations providing these experiences.
Paul Rose, television presenter, expedition leader for National Geographic’s Pristine Seas Expeditions and former vice president of the Royal Geographic Society, said his life was turned around by a school trip when he was a teenager: “I failed my Eleven Plus and hated school. I just couldn’t see the point of anything. Then in Secondary school my Geography teacher took my class to the Brecon Beacons. All the horrors of education and learning disappeared. It was truly inspirational. At last things made sense – if I wanted to use a map and compass then I needed Maths. If I wanted to understand the map and the ground, then I needed Geography. That trip was the making of me, it was what I desperately needed. That was my door opening, it was me becoming Paul Rose. We cannot let these opportunities disappear.”
Kate Humble, television presenter, wildlife specialist and author, said: “Lessons in a classroom can only achieve so much.  School trips I took to see the geological features we were learning about in geography, or to the Natural History Museum, or simply to our local park to collect leaves & pinecones, brought those lessons alive.  They made sense of things, gave us all a greater understanding & appreciation of what we were learning, and made our newfound knowledge something exciting.  They were an invaluable part of my education.”
Dr Anne Hunt, Chief Executive for the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom (CLOtC), said: “Covid related school closures and restrictions are resulting in organisations who provide high quality educational visits closing their venues and losing whole teams of staff and volunteers. With no overnight visits since March and for the foreseeable future, the providers of residential learning experiences are facing particularly challenging circumstances. There is a very real possibility that many organisations providing these very valuable learning opportunities simply won’t survive the current crisis, meaning a whole generation of pupils could go through school without experiencing a visit to a museum, a field studies trip or a foreign language tour.”
Even though UK-based educational day visits are permitted by the Department for Education, the impact of the pandemic on providers is becoming very stark and it is hitting organisations big and small – the National Trust is currently consulting on a proposal that would make all its learning staff redundant, PGL has lost a quarter of its workforce, STA Travel ceased trading in August, and Cheddar Caves has closed ‘for the foreseeable future’.
Dr Hunt continues: “Alongside the impact on the  dedicated skilled staff and volunteers who run these inspiring programmes, these closures will push the opportunities for educational visits beyond the reach of the many thousands of children who we know do not get the chance to have these experiences in any other way than with their schools.’’
The evidence is clear that learning outside the classroom, including through well-planned educational visits supports pupils to engage with their learning and delivers a wide range of socio-emotional outcomes that underpin their achievement and attainment. It also has a positive impact on children’s health and wellbeing.  School-based learning outside the classroom opportunities should be an integral part of strategies for supporting all children and young people to recover from the consequences of disrupted learning.
Prof Justin Dillon, Professor of Science and Environmental Education at Exeter University, said: “There is a wealth of evidence that learning outside the classroom can have a transformative impact on education and learning. Given that the National Foundation for Education Research has reported recently that the gap in inequalities between children from different social backgrounds has widened already by 46% in a year, it is clear that educational visits can play a crucial role in enabling pupils to ‘catch up’ and address this widening inequality in education.”
Martin Smith, Chair of the Outdoor Education Advisers’ Panel said: “The Department for Education has given approval for schools to take day visits off-site. We strongly encourage schools to utilise local venues, grounds and amenities to help bring some normality back to student’s lives and build confidence in undertaking educational visits further a field. Such activities are essential for young people in terms of broadening their horizons and to help accelerate their learning. We also need insurance companies to cover educational visits for Covid-related cancellations. Without this, teachers aren’t able to plan ahead which is further affecting the ability of educational visit providers to recover from the pandemic.’’
To support the educational visits sector and protect these vital opportunities for children and young people, the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom, the Outdoor Education Advisers Panel, School Travel Forum and the Expedition Providers Association are working with Government to advocate for:

Recognising the positive benefits that learning outside the classroom and educational visits can deliver and their role in helping address widening inequalities
Reiterating the recommendation that schools can take their learning off-site and on day visits, and work with other learning providers to bring their services into schools, as long as these follow school Covid secure guidelines
Working with insurance companies to ensure future educational visits are covered for cancellations arising due to Covid so schools can start planning for the future.

Dr Hunt continues: “There is a unique opportunity for the learning outside the classroom sector to be mobilised to support more schools to take their learning beyond the classroom, dramatically increasing health, wellbeing and learning outcomes for all children and young people. If we do nothing there is a very real risk that these benefits will only be available to some children and young people and many of these experiences may no longer be available at all when restrictions are finally lifted. If we fail to act now, a whole generation of children may miss out.”",tv presenter and adventurer paul rose and kate humble have given their support to school visit a a generation of young people risk

Fife College streams lessons live so students don’t miss out – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'Further Education', 'News']","October 8, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/fife-college-streams-lessons-live-so-students-dont-miss-out/,"Fife College has brought in an innovative system to live stream lessons to students to make sure that they don’t miss out on their learning experience.
The College is currently using a blended learning approach due to the Coronavirus, with some students carrying out their studies online.
For subjects such as Maths and Biology this has led to classes being split in two, with students rotating who will be in class and who will be studying from home each week.
However this had the potential to limit the amount of face-to-face teaching students received, so the College has introduced a live-stream of lessons, meaning that those studying at home can participate in the class and ask questions of the lecturer throughout.
The classes also include an interactive whiteboard so that students can see what is being written up by the lecturer and interact with it, and it also allows for captions to be included and for an interpreter to appear on screen for those who are hearing impaired.
If students are unable to watch the lesson as it happens, they also have the opportunity to watch a recording of it that is uploaded on to Microsoft Teams afterwards.
Stewart McDonald, Academic Head for Engineering, Science and Mathematics at Fife College, said: “Given the measures we’ve put in place to ensure the health and safety of staff at Fife College, it’s not been possible to have all students return to class.
“This left some facing a reduction in the amount of face-to-face teaching time that they receive, which could potentially have an impact on their studies.
“The College’s priority during these times is to ensure the best possible learning experience for all students, which is why we developed this system of live streaming lessons to those who aren’t in class.
“Not only does it allow them to follow lessons as they happen, but they can ask questions and take part in class activities as they happen.
“We’ve already had great feedback from students, and we’ll continue to investigate ways that we can enhance their learning experience.”
The online system has proved popular with students, with Alexandra Marjoram, a student studying National 4 Maths at Fife College saying it helped her feel as if she was still in the lesson with her classmates. She said: “It was good because despite being at home I still felt I was part of the class, I could see what was going on and raise my hand and ask questions if I had any queries.
“I could hear what other students who were studying from home were saying so it felt like we were one big class despite having been separated into different bubbles.
“If you’re needing any help or you’re struggling you can ask questions, go back to previous lectures, or you can communicate with your classmates on the chat function.”
Natalie Fisher, who is also on the National 4 Maths course is hearing impaired, and said the technology helped her understanding of lessons.
“The advantage is I can see live captions at the same time as the interpreter as some English is different from the British Sign Language, and now I have both.
“I and others who are hard of hearing have hearing aids on so we can listen in to the lesson through those which is another advantage.”",fife college ha brought in an innovative system to live stream lesson to student to make sure that they dont miss out on their learning experience the college is currently using a blended learning approach due to the coronavirus with some student carrying out their study online for subject such a math and biology this ha led to class being split in two with student rotating who will be in class and who will be studying from home each week however this had the potential to limit the amount of facetoface teaching student received so the college ha introduced a livestream of lesson meaning that those studying at home can participate in the class and ask question of the lecturer throughout the class also include an interactive whiteboard so that student can see what is being written up by the lecturer and interact with it and it also allows for caption to be included and for an interpreter to appear on screen for those who are hearing impaired if student are unable to watch the lesson a it happens they also have the opportunity to watch a recording of it that is uploaded on to microsoft team afterwards stewart mcdonald academic head for engineering science and mathematics at fife college said given the measure weve put in place to ensure the health and safety of staff at fife college it not been possible to have all student return to class this left some facing a reduction in the amount of facetoface teaching time that they receive which could potentially have an impact on their study the college priority during these time is to ensure the best possible learning experience for all student which is why we developed this system of live streaming lesson to those who arent in class not only doe it allow them to follow lesson a they happen but they can ask question and take part in class activity a they happen weve already had great feedback from student and well continue to investigate way that we can enhance their learning experience the online system ha proved popular with student with alexandra marjoram a student studying national math at fife college saying it helped her feel a if she wa still in the lesson with her classmate she said it wa good because despite being at home i still felt i wa part of the class i could see what wa going on and raise my hand and ask question if i had any query i could hear what other student who were studying from home were saying so it felt like we were one big class despite having been separated into different bubble if youre needing any help or youre struggling you can ask question go back to previous lecture or you can communicate with your classmate on the chat function natalie fisher who is also on the national math course is hearing impaired and said the technology helped her understanding of lesson the advantage is i can see live caption at the same time a the interpreter a some english is different from the british sign language and now i have both i and others who are hard of hearing have hearing aid on so we can listen in to the lesson through those which is another advantage,"['livestream', 'class', 'studying', 'academic', 'lecture', 'teaching', 'microsoft', 'coronavirus', 'biology', 'online']"
TransUnion and Leeds United team up to teach teens about finance – Education Today,"['Financial education', 'KS3', 'KS4', 'News', 'Secondary schools', 'Support materials']","October 7, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/transunion-and-leeds-united-team-up-to-teach-teens-about-finance/,"TransUnion, one of the UK’s leading credit reference agencies, has teamed up with Premier League football club Leeds United to take its education programme – Credit Scores Explained – into schools.
Focusing on being financially fit in preparation for adult life, the #KnowYourScore initiative will launch in Leeds, ahead of a national rollout next year.
Kelli Fielding, managing director of consumer interactive at TransUnion in the UK said: “Our Credit Scores Explained course will be delivered in secondary schools, in partnership with the Leeds United Foundation. Our aim is to give teens the best start to their financial life, helping them learn more about managing money and understanding from an early age the role that their credit report and score can play.
“This information can help prepare them for their adult lives, whatever path they choose, and is particularly timely, as COVID-19 exacerbates financial stresses. Nearly a third (31%) of teens say their parents talking about money worries is making them think more about finance, according to our recent survey.”
Paul Bell, executive director at Leeds United added: “We’re really pleased to be working with TransUnion on this, so that together we can support the community and help teach young people important life skills. Our charity foundation has a strong rapport with numerous local schools, and the interest we’ve had to date has been fantastic, so we’re looking forward to getting started.”
The course, which is for young people aged between 13 and 18, will cover specific aspects of managing money and the role credit information plays in day-to-day life, with lessons aligning to financial education frameworks.
It follows a successful pilot programme last year with three local secondary schools, including Corpus Christi in Leeds. Mr Stones, lead teacher of business and enterprise there said: “The students found the session to be enlightening, engaging and informative. As a college we appreciate the support and insight that private organisations such as TransUnion can provide to help us equip our students for their futures.”
The latest research from TransUnion confirms the need to combat a lack of wider financial awareness amongst teenagers. One in seven young people (14%) lack confidence in basic money skills, only a third feel confident they can stick to a budget (36%) and just a tenth (9%) are comfortable keeping up repayments on money loaned. Whilst the majority look to their parents for money advice, lessons at school and banks are the next most important sources of this information.

New multi-academy trust offers broadest range of secondary and sixth form options in Cambridgeshire – Education Today,"['Academies', 'MATs', 'News']","October 6, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-multi-academy-trust-offers-broadest-range-of-secondary-and-sixth-form-options-in-cambridgeshire/,"A new multi-academy trust, The Learning Alliance (TLA), has been officially launched with the merger of two existing successful trusts – Cambridgeshire Educational Trust (CET) and Morris Education Trust (MET).
CET (which included Chesterton Community College and Downham Market Academy) and MET (which included Impington Village College, Impington International College and Witchford Village College) each had strong track records for academic excellence and innovation. Together, they now offer the widest range of subject and qualification options of any non-selective secondary school or sixth form in Cambridgeshire. These include GCSEs, A Levels, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Programme, Diploma Programme and Career-related Programme, and BTECs.
Heading the new trust’s leadership team are Lucy Scott, of Chesterton Community College, which consistenly achieves in the top 1% of schools in the country for exam performance and is rated outstanding by Ofsted, and Ryan Kelsall, previously Principal of Impington Village College, which was selected as State School of the Year in East Anglia in the Sunday Times Parent Power list 2020.
Lucy Scott, CEO of TLA, said: “Our new Trust is a small purposeful family of schools, each with its own distinct identity which, combined, offer more choice than any other group of schools, enabling every student to pursue their dreams and passions. As our Trust grows, each school will retain that identity but share the same values and standards of academic rigour, excellent extra-curricular opportunities and exceptional arts and performing arts.
“What makes TLA so very different is that it is born out of an alliance between two existing trusts, not out of a need for one school to grow. Our joint commitment is to being proudly international and internationally minded, serving a diverse community of families from Cambridge, across the UK and overseas, facilitated by our host family network, with a broad, specialist and inclusive provision.
Ryan Kelsall, Deputy CEO of TLA, added: “Our new Trust offers a truly international experience for students with over 40 different languages spoken by students at Chesterton Community College alone. We value equality and promote diversity in our schools and are committed to continuing to increase the number of our students studying languages in KS4.”
Rolf Purvis, Headteacher at Downham Market Academy, is part of the Trust’s new senior leadership team and has become the new Executive Headteacher at Witchford Village College. He said: “Within the Trust’s team we really do have an enviable wealth of teaching and school improvement experience, evidenced by the success of Downham Market Academy and its Athena Sixth Form College, since they became part of CET in 2017.”
Lucy Scott concluded: “Our existing schools have long track records for supporting students in achieving their full potential in a happy, respectful and nurturing environment. They also have reputations for providing excellent professional development opportunities for teachers and staff and, through our merger, we are combining all of this knowledge, experience and insight.”",a new multiacademy trust the learning alliance tla ha been officially launched with the merger of two existing successful trust cambridgeshire educational trust cet and morris education trust met cet which included chesterton community college and downham market academy and met which included impington village college impington international college and witchford village college each had strong track record for academic excellence and innovation together they now offer the widest range of subject and qualification option of any nonselective secondary school or sixth form in cambridgeshire these include gcse a level the international baccalaureate ib middle year programme diploma programme and careerrelated programme and btecs heading the new trust leadership team are lucy scott of chesterton community college which consistenly achieves in the top of school in the country for exam performance and is rated outstanding by ofsted and ryan kelsall previously principal of impington village college which wa selected a state school of the year in east anglia in the sunday time parent power list lucy scott ceo of tla said our new trust is a small purposeful family of school each with it own distinct identity which combined offer more choice than any other group of school enabling every student to pursue their dream and passion a our trust grows each school will retain that identity but share the same value and standard of academic rigour excellent extracurricular opportunity and exceptional art and performing art what make tla so very different is that it is born out of an alliance between two existing trust not out of a need for one school to grow our joint commitment is to being proudly international and internationally minded serving a diverse community of family from cambridge across the uk and overseas facilitated by our host family network with a broad specialist and inclusive provision ryan kelsall deputy ceo of tla added our new trust offer a truly international experience for student with over different language spoken by student at chesterton community college alone we value equality and promote diversity in our school and are committed to continuing to increase the number of our student studying language in k rolf purvis headteacher at downham market academy is part of the trust new senior leadership team and ha become the new executive headteacher at witchford village college he said within the trust team we really do have an enviable wealth of teaching and school improvement experience evidenced by the success of downham market academy and it athena sixth form college since they became part of cet in lucy scott concluded our existing school have long track record for supporting student in achieving their full potential in a happy respectful and nurturing environment they also have reputation for providing excellent professional development opportunity for teacher and staff and through our merger we are combining all of this knowledge experience and insight,"['gcse', 'principal', 'merger', 'academic', 'cambridgeshire', 'innovation', 'btecs', 'careerrelated', 'cambridge', 'headteacher']"
Stockport student wins Rise Up 2020 for plantable chocolate wrapper that grows into flowers – Education Today,"['Competition', 'Digital skills', 'News', 'Secondary schools', 'Social issues']","October 5, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/stockport-student-wins-rise-up-2020-for-plantable-chocolate-wrapper-that-grows-into-flowers/,"Layla Assi (aged 16) from Stockport, Greater Manchester, studying at Southport College, Merseyside, has been named the winner of “Best Campaign” in advertising and digital skills competition, Rise Up 2020. Part of The Code from global advertising, marketing and digital agency, Dentsu, Rise Up 2020 challenged young people from diverse backgrounds to put their creativity to the test and develop a purpose-led brand campaign for Cadbury.
The young talent impressed the judges, including Cadbury’s Senior Brand Manager, Claudia Miceli and Brand Manager, Lyndsey Homer, as well as Paola Cassinelli, Senior Brand Manager from Mondelēz and Lauren Ashleigh Kelly, Client Director from Dentsu’s agency, Carat.
The winning campaign recommends using biodegradable paper wrappers, including a limited edition seeded card that can be planted to grow into plants and flowers. The judges were particularly impressed with the concept of taking something with a negative image and impact – packaging and wrappers – and turning it into a positive asset that helps promote biodiversity.
In her winning pitch to the judges, Layla Assi explained:
“It’s about time we started looking after the planet. Cadbury can be seen as a company that cares about the world’s future as well as their customers. Young, old, Cadbury consumers would be making a contribution to their ecosystem by simply buying a bar of chocolate. Cadbury really can feed the planet one wrapper at a time.”
The annual Rise Up competition, now in its fourth year, provides young people with a real-world client brief and support to create and present an advertising and marketing campaign to a panel of senior industry decision-makers. This year’s competition called on young people to create a campaign for Cadbury. They were challenged to shine a light on everyday moments of generosity and kindness, building on Cadbury’s history of social justice and community spirit, to show how the brand can inspire and showcase a little more goodness in the world.
The Code was launched in January 2017 in the UK as a proactive solution to the industry-wide need to promote a diverse workforce reflective of the population. It aims to excite young people about careers in advertising, digital industries and marketing. Dentsu works with schools in areas of low social mobility across the UK, specifically with schools that have an above-average percentage of students of BAME heritage and also above-average numbers of young people entitled to free school meals. 240 young people joined Rise Up 2020; 52% of competition entrants were from BAME backgrounds and 61% were female. The Code’s name is derived from its four pillars: Creativity, Opportunity, Diversity, Empowerment.
Euan Jarvie, CEO, Dentsu UK and Ireland, said: “2020 has been a challenging year for young people who have had to contend not only with studying remotely during lockdown, but also seeing opportunities for work experience and training dry up. We were determined to make sure Rise Up remained accessible for the young people taking part in The Code to enable as many as possible to enter this year’s competition. Layla’s concept stood out for its environmental impact and clear link to an urgent issue. We’re all looking forward to seeing the idea evolve when Layla joins the Mondelēz and Carat brand teams for work experience, and know she has a bright future ahead of her.
“The advertising industry cannot expect to connect and engage diverse audiences with impactful brand campaigns if the teams behind them are not equally as diverse. In 2016, we recognised that starting to resolve the lack of diversity in the advertising industry would mean directly reaching out to people of different heritages, life experiences and social backgrounds, and exciting them about careers in fields they may never have considered. That is good for us, it’s good for the young people and schools taking part, and ultimately it’s good for the brands we work with.”
Lyndsey Homer, Brand Manager, Mondelēz (parent company of Cadbury’s), said: “Congratulations to Layla for creating an engaging and timely campaign. It has been a tough year for so many people up and down the country. The thousands of examples of generosity and kindness we’ve all witnessed have been essential to getting the nation through this crisis. Rise Up called on young creative minds to show that there’s a ‘glass and a half’ in everyone and showcase those acts of goodness. Layla’s campaign achieves that and more.”
Chiana Pettitt from Southend High School in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, was also highly commended by the judges for her one-minute elevator pitch. Her slogan, “Kindness and generosity is happiness – happiness is Cadbury”, captured the judges’ attention. So too did her wider campaign encouraging consumers to complete a bingo-style board of acts of kindness – from cooking a meal for a neighbour to saying ‘good morning’ to a stranger – and sharing their moments of generosity on social media.
In addition, all of the Rise Up 2020 finalists were surprised at the virtual awards ceremony with the offer of mentoring sessions with Dentsu experts to talk about life, school and their career paths. Each of the finalists received an XBOX Game Pass too to reward their impressive efforts.

Local student wins prestigious national languages competition – Education Today,"['Competition', 'KS5', 'Modern languages', 'News']","October 2, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/local-student-wins-prestigious-national-languages-competition/,"Stratford Girl’s Grammar School student Kirsty Duncan has won the national Mother Tongue Other Tongue KS5 French competition for 2020.
Mother Tongue Other Tongue is a national multilingual poetry competition that celebrates cultural diversity and the many languages currently spoken in schools across the UK. The competition aims to celebrate languages, culture and language-learning, allowing secondary school students to practice and improve their foreign language skills and appreciate their heritage using poetry.
The competition was originally developed by the Faculty of Humanities, Languages and Social Science at Manchester Metropolitan University and Routes into Languages North West. It has since rolled out across the country and become a nationally recognised award, with students from all over the UK competing for the annual prize. Mother Tongue Other Tongue is officially endorsed by Malala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner and education activist.
This year, ‘other tongue’ entries required an original poem written in a language that is not the first language spoken by the student writing it. Entries could be provided in Spanish, German, Italian, or French.
Kirsty initially entered the competition during the height of the coronavirus pandemic that saw schools close and students study from home, attending all of their classes virtually. The competition was suggested to Kirsty by her French teacher at Stratford Girls’ Grammar School as an extra way to apply herself with language learning during this time.
Kirsty said, “I enjoy linguistic challenges like these as they are always a bit like a puzzle. I wasn’t expecting to finish the poem at first,  because I thought it would be too difficult to get it to rhyme or to keep a coherent theme throughout. But after writing each verse, I discovered I really enjoyed constructing each line. In the end, I created something that I was proud of, regardless of the competition results. When I found out that I had been named the winner, I was really over the moon. It was definitely a confidence boost before taking my mock French exam the next day!”
In addition to being named this years KS5 French winner, Kirsty also received an Amazon gift voucher. Stephanie Wood is Head of Modern Foreign Language studies at Stratford Girls’ Grammar School, she said,
“We are very proud of what Kirsty has achieved with her fantastic poem and ongoing commitment to learning. Competitions like Mother Tongue Other Tongue are incredibly welcomed by our school as they help broaden students understanding beyond the classroom, which is especially important after the unexpected lockdown situation earlier this year. Students have now returned to our school, but we are still encouraging them to enter more competitions, such as those celebrating the European Day of Languages this month. Congratulations once again to Kirsty for her well-deserved win and prize.”",stratford girl grammar school student kirsty duncan ha won the national mother tongue other tongue k french competition for mother tongue other tongue is a national multilingual poetry competition that celebrates cultural diversity and the many language currently spoken in school across the uk the competition aim to celebrate language culture and languagelearning allowing secondary school student to practice and improve their foreign language skill and appreciate their heritage using poetry the competition wa originally developed by the faculty of humanity language and social science at manchester metropolitan university and route into language north west it ha since rolled out across the country and become a nationally recognised award with student from all over the uk competing for the annual prize mother tongue other tongue is officially endorsed by malala yousafzai the youngest nobel peace prize winner and education activist this year other tongue entry required an original poem written in a language that is not the first language spoken by the student writing it entry could be provided in spanish german italian or french kirsty initially entered the competition during the height of the coronavirus pandemic that saw school close and student study from home attending all of their class virtually the competition wa suggested to kirsty by her french teacher at stratford girl grammar school a an extra way to apply herself with language learning during this time kirsty said i enjoy linguistic challenge like these a they are always a bit like a puzzle i wasnt expecting to finish the poem at first because i thought it would be too difficult to get it to rhyme or to keep a coherent theme throughout but after writing each verse i discovered i really enjoyed constructing each line in the end i created something that i wa proud of regardless of the competition result when i found out that i had been named the winner i wa really over the moon it wa definitely a confidence boost before taking my mock french exam the next day in addition to being named this year k french winner kirsty also received an amazon gift voucher stephanie wood is head of modern foreign language study at stratford girl grammar school she said we are very proud of what kirsty ha achieved with her fantastic poem and ongoing commitment to learning competition like mother tongue other tongue are incredibly welcomed by our school a they help broaden student understanding beyond the classroom which is especially important after the unexpected lockdown situation earlier this year student have now returned to our school but we are still encouraging them to enter more competition such a those celebrating the european day of language this month congratulation once again to kirsty for her welldeserved win and prize,"['girl', 'classroom', 'annual', 'kirsty', 'amazon', 'competition', 'competing', 'teacher', 'mother', 'nobel']"
Leading EdTech companies join forces to create free online teaching masterclass – Education Today,['News'],"October 1, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/leading-edtech-companies-join-forces-to-create-free-online-teaching-masterclass/,"ClickView partners with Makematic, Adobe, iCivics and Participate to deliver much needed Teaching Online Masterclass (TOM), a free video course for educators full of practical strategies for online teaching
As schools and colleges settle into the ‘new normal’ and return to classroom-based teaching for the first time in nearly six months, the impact of closures due to COVID-19 has highlighted the undeniable importance of digital and blended learning.
Educators across the UK have had to adapt quickly and in many cases without training to teach remotely and deliver lessons online. With increased concerns about the potential for local lockdowns and the need to revert to remote teaching without much warning, the masterclass couldn’t be better timed.
Responding to the pressures felt by teachers across the globe, leading EdTech companies have joined forces to create a free online teaching masterclass, TOM.
Introducing Teaching Online Masterclass (TOM)
The world-leading video content resource for primary schools, secondary schools and further education settings, ClickView, has partnered with Makematic, Adobe and iCivics, to name a few of the EdTech companies involved, to launch a new online masterclass series, TOM.
TOM is a free online professional development resource for teachers making the leap into online learning. The move to remote and blended learning has been accelerated worldwide during the COVID19 pandemic. This engaging, self-paced video series provides teachers grappling with change, practical approaches, and strategies for online teaching.
The ‘new normal’ is likely to include a more blended approach to teaching and learning at all levels; with ongoing uncertainty around local lockdowns and the evident need for education to play catch up with the digital world of today.
Teaching online is about more than just the technology. Of course, it is important to know your Teams from Zooms from your Google Classrooms, but the way lessons are planned, classrooms are managed and engaging with students is different online too.
Created for educators by educators, discover useful strategies for online learning and hear from experienced teachers, academics and industry professionals who share their expertise and insights in more than 50 bite sized videos, which focus on pedagogy.
TOM aims to equip educators with the confidence and skills they need to teach successfully online, including practical, actionable strategies that can be implemented straight away.
ClickView CEO, Edward Filetti, explains: 
“2020 has seen educators have to adapt to an entirely new way of planning, teaching, assessing, and resourcing, in addition to ensuring the wellbeing of their students without a physical presence. They’ve been expected to become masters of digital teaching and learning tools overnight, regardless of their experience, budget or the digital resources already at their disposal. The Teaching Online Masterclass gives teachers everything they need to deliver engaging, proven outcomes with their students, and we’re providing it 100% free.”
Tara Walsh, Director of Engagement, and Innovation, Makematic said:
“TOM is a series that has been created with K-12 educators in mind. It focuses on online pedagogy over technology and really takes into account what the research tells us works in this space. The contributors were carefully chosen because of their expertise in the K-12 education space, as practitioners or professionals who really know what it takes to be a super online educator. More than ever educators are crying out for resources such as this, and that’s why it’s such an exciting project to be involved in.”
The Masterclass series itself is organised into six categories:
1. Online is different: Looks at the key differences between teaching online and in a face-to-face environment, with plenty of tips and tools for successful online teaching.
2. Designing online learning experiences: Explores the elements of effective and inclusive online learning, how to prepare students and how best to approach feedback and assessment.
3. Pedagogical strategies: Looks at cognitive, behavioural, emotional and social pedagogy tips, strategies, and activities for reimagining classes online.
4. Technology as a tool: Advice for choosing the right technology, multimedia, and online education resources, how to facilitate live classes and also make instructional videos.
5. Community building: Explores how to develop a community of practice and professional learning network, plus ways to facilitate partnerships with parents and caregivers.
6. Digital well-being: Looks at the best ways for educators and students to find balance when using technology more often.
The online masterclass contributors are from different parts of the world, meaning unique content with multicultural perspectives, which provides insights into how countries abroad have approached online learning.
Scott Hayden, Digital Innovation Specialist & Lecturer, Basingstoke College of Technology (DfE EdTech Demonstrator college) and one of the UK contributors to the site commented:
“The TOM series gives authentic, genuine, and empathetic support to teachers making their first attempt at what is a daunting task. The on-demand pick ‘n mix approach makes teachers able to select bespoke support easily, as and when they need it, for FREE.”

Education Select Committee Chair hails Ron Dearing UTC as flagship for future of learning – Education Today,"['Digital learning', 'Digital skills', 'Educational event', 'Engineering', 'Maths', 'News']","October 1, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/education-select-committee-chair-hails-ron-dearing-utc-as-flagship-for-future-of-learning/,"A leading education expert has hailed Ron Dearing University Technical College (UTC) as a flagship school and praised staff for transforming the lives of students.
Robert Halfon, Chair of the Education Select Committee and Conservative MP for Harlow in Essex, took time out from his Parliamentary roles to visit Hull’s employer-led school.
He met Principal Sarah Pashley and her Senior Leadership Team, spoke to students, observed engineering, maths and digital media lessons, experienced virtual reality technology and met two former students who have been taken on as apprentices by one of the school’s Founding Partners, Spencer Group.
Mr Halfon also took questions from Year 13 students about online learning, apprenticeships and concerns about exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Halfon said: “Ron Dearing UTC is one of the flagship UTCs and it’s been a pleasure to visit because everything I believe about in education seems to be reflected in the ethos of this school.
“It is clearly transforming the lives of hundreds of students. Some of them may not have been so successful in their traditional schools previously, but they clearly love learning here.
“They told me a key reason they came to this school is because they’ve got a very good chance of having a great career afterwards.
“To me, this is the future and this school is truly fit for the 21st century. The organisational ethos is second to none and there is a really great atmosphere.
“It’s all down to leadership. Every time I’ve visited a great school, I’ve found it’s because it has a brilliant leadership team.”
Mr Halfon added: “I’m a huge supporter of UTCs because I think they’re the future of learning and they’re doing things that are absolutely vital because the world is changing. I would love it if there were many more UTCs like Ron Dearing UTC – one in every town and city.
“A fourth industrial revolution is under way, driven by technology, and 28% of jobs that are currently done by young people could be lost to automation.
“This is why education has to change. Students here are destined for good jobs with blue chip companies – they’re the people who are going to thrive in this new industrial revolution.”
Mr Halfon took time for a Q&A session with students and said he understood their concerns regarding the impact of Covid-19 on education.
Year 13 student Alex Burr, 17, asked Mr Halfon for his thoughts on costly university fees as face-to-face learning has decreased and more tuition is carried out online.  Alex suggested universities should offer a discount when they were unable to offer their usual curriculum.  Mr Halfon agreed that she had a very good point and said he would raise Alex’s concerns with ministers.
Principal Sarah Pashley said she was delighted the visit was able to go ahead despite the challenges posed by Covid-19.
She said: “It’s a really key time for a visit such as this because education is facing many challenges at the moment and it’s really good to have somebody who is influential in Government to feed back the views of staff and students.
“Mr Halfon has certainly been very interested to hear what we have to say about how we get through the difficult next 12 months in education.  It’s also great to meet someone who is clearly a huge supporter of technical education and apprenticeships and understands how education needs to change.
“We’re very passionate about our curriculum, with its balance between technical and academic learning, the opportunities it provides for students to apply theory to real practice and the very strong partnerships we have with our employer sponsors and the University of Hull.
“Mr Halfon seems to agree with us that this approach is the way forward for education in this country.

The importance of providing specialist performing arts works hand in hand at the school with the successful teaching of core academic subjects. They provide an additional platform for all pupils to engage in a creative environment that allows them to grow, thrive and learn on their journey through the school.
In the primary school pupils take part in weekly drama, dance and music lessons and secondary pupils continue to participate in all performing arts subjects, with the addition of studying film studies from year 9 to GCSE.
Performing arts facilities at the school include a studio theatre, music teaching spaces and a TV and film production studio and a spacious main hall. The Bedford Music Hub is also based on the school site and this strong partnership offers networking opportunities and the sharing of resources and expertise.
Over recent years the 4SIXTEEN Theatre Company, the school’s in-house theatre company under the direction of the school’s resident theatre director, has produced a number of award-winning shows including The Lion King, The Railway Children, We Will Rock you and The Addams Family. The company are currently rehearsing (within government guidelines due to Covid-19) for their next production Sister Act.
Ruth Wilkes, Federation Principal, said “We are incredibly proud of our pupils and their achievements within performing arts and the NODA awards won for the school productions are testament to the dedication, hard work and expertise of the staff and pupils involved in these magnificent and high quality theatre productions.”
Luke Skeel, Federation Head of Performing Arts said, “Watching our pupils from an early age engaging in the arts is so powerful. The arts are integral to the wellbeing and development of all children. Our staff come from all backgrounds of the arts sector and their experiences mean that we are able to shape our high-quality provision.
“I am proud to lead such a dedicated team whose mission is one thing – that all children should have the opportunity to learn the joy of singing, playing an instrument, dancing and acting. We engage in dance research projects through our partnership with the University of Bedfordshire and our pupils participated in Generations Dancing which was covered by national news.
“We are on a new journey building all-through performing arts education, we have plans to create an all-through choir, expand our dance company and continue to develop our suite of GCSE qualifications, to include a second music course which focuses on music technology.”",performing art is a creative thread that run through the whole of castle newnham school bedford from year to year the importance of providing specialist performing art work hand in hand at the school with the successful teaching of core academic subject they provide an additional platform for all pupil to engage in a creative environment that allows them to grow thrive and learn on their journey through the school in the primary school pupil take part in weekly drama dance and music lesson and secondary pupil continue to participate in all performing art subject with the addition of studying film study from year to gcse performing art facility at the school include a studio theatre music teaching space and a tv and film production studio and a spacious main hall the bedford music hub is also based on the school site and this strong partnership offer networking opportunity and the sharing of resource and expertise over recent year the sixteen theatre company the school inhouse theatre company under the direction of the school resident theatre director ha produced a number of awardwinning show including the lion king the railway child we will rock you and the addams family the company are currently rehearsing within government guideline due to covid for their next production sister act ruth wilkes federation principal said we are incredibly proud of our pupil and their achievement within performing art and the noda award won for the school production are testament to the dedication hard work and expertise of the staff and pupil involved in these magnificent and high quality theatre production luke skeel federation head of performing art said watching our pupil from an early age engaging in the art is so powerful the art are integral to the wellbeing and development of all child our staff come from all background of the art sector and their experience mean that we are able to shape our highquality provision i am proud to lead such a dedicated team whose mission is one thing that all child should have the opportunity to learn the joy of singing playing an instrument dancing and acting we engage in dance research project through our partnership with the university of bedfordshire and our pupil participated in generation dancing which wa covered by national news we are on a new journey building allthrough performing art education we have plan to create an allthrough choir expand our dance company and continue to develop our suite of gcse qualification to include a second music course which focus on music technology,"['studying', 'performing', 'choir', 'principal', 'education', 'theatre', 'awardwinning', 'academic', 'teaching', 'rehearsing']"
Primary and secondary school programmes launched to engage pupils in Census 2021 – Education Today,"['Citizenship', 'Maths', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Resources', 'Secondary schools', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","September 29, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/primary-and-secondary-school-programmes-launched-to-engage-pupils-in-census-2021/,"The next generation is set to learn all about the census and how it benefits their local area as part of two new, engaging educational programmes launching this term.
With just 6 months until the next census, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has developed a series of census-related lessons and activities for both primary and secondary schools across England and Wales. Now it is calling on schools to sign up.
The primary school campaign, Let’s Count!, is a cross-curricular programme developed in conjunction with Family and Education and their education resource centre, iChild. The education programme is designed to excite children and families alike about the census.
Let’s Count! has achieved accreditation from Mathematics in Education and Industry, National Association for the Teaching of English, and the Geographical Association. With maths and statistics at its core, the programme provides flexible lesson plans and engaging activities for pupils to learn how they can use statistics across many topics.
British historian, Professor David Olusoga OBE, is also on board and he will be delivering a special live stream lesson on equality and representation.
Professor Olusoga said: “I am thrilled to be part of this campaign. I passionately believe in public history and above all in making the stories of everyone and every community in the UK accessible to children. 2020 has been a year in which young people have shown us that equality and representation, the issues my lesson will explore, are issues that acutely matter to them. The census – as ever – will provide a snapshot of who we are as a nation. History explains how we got here.”
Meanwhile, a secondary school campaign has been developed by EVERFI EdComs. The programme was co-created with teachers and students to develop engaging content to help raise awareness of the census with a pre-launch film profiling the diverse voices of the census being released today. Students will explore why the census matters to them and their local communities, covering topics across the curriculum.
Iain Bell, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “These programmes offer a great opportunity for children to learn about the importance of the census. They help children learn more about maths and their own local area, and they will also raise awareness of the census, which informs many important issues like the number of school place or hospital beds. By running programmes in primary and secondary schools across England and Wales, we want to engage pupils of all ages in the census and by doing so make Census 2021 a huge success.”
The Let’s Count! primary school campaign was piloted during the 2019 Census rehearsal, with many schools taking part within the rehearsal areas. A selection of schools also took part in the Let’s Count! competition, creating school-centred census displays, with Jubilee Primary School in Hackney being crowned the winners.
George Gould, Head of Year 6 at Jubilee Primary school, said: “This competition was a great way of developing all of our children’s statistics and citizenship skills, speaking and listening to members of the local community and collecting and presenting data.”
Phil Bird, CEO of Family & Education/iChild said: “We are delighted to be part of this unique event, and excited to develop and share time-saving Census 2021 education resources with our iChild network. The Let’s Count! programme will help improve maths, geography and writing skills, using Census 2021, a significant real-life event, as a stimulus. It has accreditation and exclusive content from MEI, NATE and the Geographical Association.”
The Secondary School Education Programme will aim to engage young people, empowering them to use their voices to encourage their families and community to complete the census. The programme will use real-world tasks to explore how data is used and influences decisions across society. The lesson content will inspire whole-school participation and link to curriculum subjects such as citizenship, PSHE, maths and history.
Darren Sayer, Secondary Deputy Headteacher at Hanson Academy, Bradford, said: “The census is a very worthwhile topic and the resources provided by this programme form a very valuable insight into why data and information are so important and how they can affect change.”
Nick Fuller, President of EVERFI EdComs said: “It’s great to be part of this historic campaign and we at EVERFI EdComs want to ensure young people and their families understand what Census 2021 means for them and the communities they live in.”
It is hoped the school campaigns will help raise awareness of the digital-first census, happening on 21 March 2021. The census occurs once every ten years and provides a snapshot of households in England and Wales, helping to plan and fund public services.

"Many children feel healthier and are more active since the return to school, research finds – Education Today","['Catering & Nutrition', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Social issues', 'Sport & Play', 'Wellbeing']","September 28, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/many-children-feel-healthier-and-are-more-active-since-the-return-to-school-research-finds/,"A new survey from the British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) analyses how the healthy eating habits and physical activity levels of both children and adults have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, throughout the lockdown and now in the recent period of eased restrictions. The survey, conducted as part of BNF Healthy Eating Week 2020, reveals that 50 percent of primary school children and 26 percent of secondary school students say that they feel better or healthier now that they are back at school, while 27 percent of adults say they feel more healthy since lockdown restrictions were eased (July) compared with during the lockdown that started in March this year.
Over half (56 percent) of primary school children and exactly half (50 percent) of secondary school students surveyed say that they are more active now that they are back at school. Only 11 percent of primary school children and secondary school students say that they are now less active than before they went back to school. However, almost one third (29 percent) of adults state they are less active now than before lockdown started in March.
The survey also indicates the extent to which adults and secondary school children have turned to ‘comfort’ foods and drinks throughout the pandemic. Nearly half (46 percent) of adults and 43 percent of secondary school students say that they have consumed more chocolate when feeling tired, stressed, bored or anxious throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. 41 percent of adults and 35 percent of secondary school students have consumed more cakes or biscuits; 33 percent of adults and 41 percent of secondary school students have eaten more crisps; and 13 percent of adults and 28 percent of secondary school students have drunk more sugary drinks. Well over a third (35 percent) of all adults say that they have consumed more alcohol when feeling tired, stressed, bored or anxious during the pandemic.
In contrast, 37 percent of secondary students and 18 percent of adults report eating more fruit, and 21 percent of secondary students and 12 percent of adults report eating more vegetables when feeling tired, stressed, bored or anxious.
Sara Stanner, Science Director at BNF says: “As we navigate this next stage of the pandemic, we know that being in good health is more important than ever to help us stay well, but making healthy choices isn’t always easy. The unprecedented effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our lives have challenged all of us so it’s great to see our survey suggest that many children are feeling healthier and are more active now they are getting back to school. However, it’s not surprising that many adults and secondary students have been reaching for less healthy foods when tired, stressed or anxious.
“BNF Healthy Eating Week aims to support children and adults to make more informed choices and to lead healthier lives by increasing knowledge of healthy eating and wellbeing, and the benefits of physical activity and cooking. 4,929 schools and nurseries, and 1,324 workplaces (or workplace teams), colleges and universities across the UK are taking part in BNF Healthy Eating Week 2020 (28 September to 4 October). The week’s activities include seven daily health challenges, which people are encouraged to take part in at school, in the workplace, or at home.”
One of the BNF Healthy Eating Week challenges is to ‘Eat more wholegrains’. The BNF survey suggests that knowledge of what wholegrain foods are among both children and adults is varied. Wholegrain foods such as bran flakes, oats, wholegrain bread and wholemeal pasta were all correctly identified by many, for example, over 40 percent of primary and over 80 percent of secondary school children and adults said that wholemeal bread is a wholegrain food. However, over 30 percent of primary and secondary school children think that basmati rice is a wholegrain food and over 20 percent of adults think that couscous is a wholegrain. Beans, potatoes with skins and dried fruit were also selected by many respondents and, although these provide fibre, they do not count as wholegrain.
BNF Healthy Eating Week also highlights the value of including a variety of different fruits and vegetables in the diet. The new survey explores consumption of fruit and vegetables among the different age groups and finds that children report eating more fruit than adults, while adults report consuming more vegetables. 52 percent of primary school children and 53 percent of secondary school students say they usually eat three or more portions of fruit each day, compared with 44 percent of adults. 53 percent of primary school children and 58 percent of secondary school students report that they eat three or more portions of vegetables each day, compared with 64 percent of adults. One in 10 primary school children and 7 percent of secondary school students say that, if they could, they would eat no vegetables at all, while a fifth (20 percent) of primary school children and 14 percent of secondary school students would choose to only ever eat one type of vegetable.
Primary school children who took part in the survey were asked to name their three favourite vegetables. The clear winner is carrots (68 percent of children), followed by beetroot (36 percent), cauliflower (32 percent) and cucumber (31 percent). Parsnips, swede and pak choi are joint last in the primary school children’s vegetable league table (0.3 percent each).
Secondary school students and adults were asked to select all of the different types of vegetables they have eaten in the last two weeks. For secondary school students, carrots also top the list, included by 84 percent. This is followed by onions, broccoli, cucumber and peas, which are each included by over 60 percent. Tomatoes are the most frequently mentioned vegetable for adults, included by 89 percent of respondents. Carrots, onions and peppers are the next most frequently included, mentioned by over 80 percent of adults. Over 70 percent of adults report eating beans (e.g. baked beans), broccoli, cucumber, lettuce and peas in the previous two weeks. Okra and celeriac are the least consumed vegetables in both age groups.
The BNF survey also asked about the social eating habits of the different age groups within the home and found that half (50 percent) of all primary school children say that they eat with other people at home five or more nights of each week, with 42 percent of these eating with others every night of the week. The number of secondary school students who say they eat with other people in the home, without the distraction of technology (TV, mobile phones, laptops, etc), five or more times a week is 53 percent, 38 percent of those eating together every night of the week. Less than a third (29 percent) of adults say that they eat with other family members, without distractions, every night of the week and 42 percent say they eat with others at home five or more nights each week.
Stanner concluded: “From our survey, while it’s good to see that many adults and children report eating with others at home regularly, about 20 percent of all groups we surveyed say they never eat with others at home without the distraction of TV, phones or other technologies. One of the BNF Healthy Eating Week challenges is to eat together and this is something that can help build healthy eating habits for children, as well as providing an ideal opportunity to chat and catch up without other distractions. Our other weekend challenge is to get active together and we asked secondary students and adults whether exercising with other helps motivate them to be active – 68 percent of adults and 73 percent of secondary students agreed. So, getting active with others, bearing in mind current measures to control the spread of COVID-19, could be a great way for many to get moving.”",a new survey from the british nutrition foundation

Royal British Legion launches new resources to help pupils learn the importance of Remembrance – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'History', 'KS1', 'KS2', 'KS3', 'KS4', 'News', 'Remembrance', 'Resources', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","September 25, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/royal-british-legion-launches-new-resources-to-help-pupils-learn-the-importance-of-remembrance/,"The Royal British Legion, together with the National Literary Trust, has created a range of teaching resources for children in Key Stages 1-4, designed to help them explore their shared heritage of Remembrance and understand its relevance to today.
In a year where the nation marked 75 years since Victory in Europe, Victory over Japan and 70 years since the beginning of the war in Korea, the Legion is also encouraging people to acknowledge the contribution of a new generation of Armed Forces who have responded alongside essential workers on the frontline in the fight against Covid-19.
The Legion’s new resources are designed to help children draw parallels between these modern-day challenges and the Second World War generation, highlighting the significance of Remembrance in today’s world. The resources have been created to provide children with the right level of support and challenge.
As the national champions of Remembrance, the Legion is committed to ensuring that it is understood and available to every child and community in the UK.
Catherine Davies, Head of Remembrance at The Royal British Legion says: “In this unique and challenging year, the Legion wants to support children in understanding why we remember. Our new teaching resources will not only teach children about the significance of remembering those from past conflicts, but also help them discover the relevance of Remembrance to today. The Royal British Legion is committed to making sure the torch of Remembrance is passed on to the next generation, and these resources will play an important role in achieving that.”
Fay Lant, Senior Programme Manager at the National Literacy Trust, says: “This year, the service and sacrifice of front-line workers is more relevant than ever before and taking a moment to pause and think about the people who work and volunteer to look after us seems especially important. As such, and as we also mark 75 years since VE Day, we have created a variety of resources for schools that tell the stories of the Second World War and offer a range of creative ways for pupils to explore Remembrance. Whether it’s taking part in our book club focused on ‘Now or Never’ by Bali Rai, creating a whole school Remembrance radio programme or creating your own work of art as an act of Remembrance, there really is something for everyone.”
The resources, available to download on the Legion’s website, include:

Assemblies – Key Stage 2 & 3 – Explore and understand what Remembrance has meant and continues to mean to us in 2020. These resources will support children in understanding the relevance of Remembrance in their lives and encourage them to find their own ways to observe it.
Bitesize Activities – Key Stage 2 & 3 – Designed to provide quick, meaningful activities which relate to both Remembrance as a whole, and through a ‘then and now’ lens.
Book Club – Key Stage 2 & 3 – Explore Remembrance and themes of ‘Then and Now’ through a popular fiction text, Now or Never by Bali Rai. The resources are tailored to each key stage and include veteran interview films and input from the author himself.
Primary and Secondary ‘whole school’ resources:

Creative Writing – Pupils can engage with Remembrance as they experience and create their own fiction texts. Extracts from Scholastic / The Royal British Legion’s book ‘Home Again’, author top tips and veteran interview films will encourage children to create their own written responses to past and present events.

By applying The Beattie Method, AT The Bus facilitators help students feel secure and valued; find enjoyment and interest in the world around them; build positive and trusting relationships; and take pride in their own unique creations.
Teachers in both mainstream and special needs schools have welcomed the transformative art as therapy programme. AT The Bus in a BOX broadens the reach of this tried and tested practice.
The need for youth mental health support — already acute before the Covid-19 pandemic — intensified during lockdown, as many young people were deprived of routines, education and relationships with peers and teachers. When leading charity YoungMinds surveyed 2036 young people with a history of mental health needs in June-July 2020, results were conclusive:

80% agreed that the pandemic had made their mental health worse
87% agreed they had felt lonely or isolated during the lockdown
31% said they had not been able to access the help they needed

DfE supports new programme launched to support up to 20 new Directors of Children’s Services – Education Today,"['Leadership', 'News', 'Policy', 'Social issues']","September 23, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/dfe-supports-new-programme-launched-to-support-up-to-20-new-directors-of-childrens-services/,"Last week saw the launch of a new programme aimed at increasing the pool of future Directors of Children’s Services, supported by the Department for Education.
The programme has been initiated in response to the DfE identifying significant challenges in attracting and retaining talented leaders in DCS roles. For example, in 2018/2019 alone, over 25% of local authorities experienced a change in DCS. It was also found that the current average length of tenure as a DCS is 47 months.
The “Upon Leaders Programme” co-created by a consortium awarded with the tender comprising of The Staff College, Institute of Public Care, Skills for Care, and GatenbySanderson, aims to increase the pool of talent leaders that flow into DCS roles with up to 20 participants in the first year, providing support that results in DCS’ remaining in the post for a longer period of time.
The programme has been designed with guidance from current DCS’s, and is looking to attract a diverse range of applicants from both the public and private sector, to find and develop those with the core behaviours and skills that are needed in a DCS role.
The programme will develop leadership and management skills, including personal leadership qualities and resilience, systems leadership and building alliances and partnerships; working in political and corporate contexts; leading in complexity; engaging communities; delivering results; innovation and change.
The first programme is open to 20 candidates with at least 3 years effective senior leadership and management experience in local government children’s services or related fields and sectors.
The application process launches today, selection will occur in October, ahead of the first programme commencing in November and running until June 2021.
Jo Davidson, Director of upon, commented: “The role of a DCS is wide-ranging, challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Due to the nature of the role, current DCS’s very rarely get the time to share what’s involved and just how much of an impact they make. Our aim is to demonstrate what life is like as a DCS and prepare our candidates for the journey they’ll take, stoking a fire in the belly of future leaders that truly want to make a positive change to children’s lives”.

The International School Award celebrates the achievements of schools that do exceptional work in international education. Fostering an international dimension in the curriculum is at the heart of the British Council’s work with schools, so that young people gain the cultural understanding and skills they need for life work in today’s world.
Stantonbury International School’s international work includes partnership activities on values and street markets with India and Lebanon through Connecting Classrooms, a global education programme; Erasmus+ project work with Spain, Greece, Poland, Czech Republic, and Estonia on matters relating to inclusion, and many other global cross-curricular activities in its Performing Arts, Modern Foreign Languages and English departments.

Sir Ciarán Devane, CEO of the British Council, said: “The school’s fantastic international work has rightfully earned it this prestigious award.

“Beyond Words” writing project launches to support young people’s mental health – Education Today,"['Literacy', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Wellbeing']","September 17, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/beyond-words-writing-project-launches-to-support-young-peoples-mental-health/,"A new creative writing project is launching today for young people to express their feelings about this extraordinary year, helping to support their mental wellbeing.
Beyond Words for Mental Health Day run by the Bupa Foundation in partnership with Cheltenham Festival, Mind and the National Literacy Trust invites young people of all ages to get their pens (or keyboards!) at the ready and share their own unique thoughts. There are no rules, so participants can also share their creative work through art, music, spoken word, photography or a combination of media.
As well as awards for individuals and schools, each person’s creative submission will generate a £3 donation from The Bupa Foundation to the partner charities to support mental wellbeing projects for young people.
Recent research from Mind shows that two thirds of young people said that their mental health worsened during lockdown. According to research by the National Literacy Trust, 2 in 5 children said writing made them feel better during lockdown and 1 in 4 children said writing helped when they felt sad that they couldn’t see friends and family.
Beyond Words for World Mental Health Day is supported by leading children’s authors including Matt Goodfellow and Jennifer Bell, as well as poets Sophia Thakur and Caleb Parkin. They have provided their thoughts to inspire entrants across the UK to take part.
Writing about how he used words to support his thinking during the pandemic Caleb, a poet said: “When things were at their most confusing and chaotic during lockdown I wrote ‘morning pages’ of whatever was in my head. I still haven’t looked at those pages, and may never, but the act of getting it on the page helped me feel calmer and clearer about another day at home during a pandemic. Writing helps us unpack and learn about pesky, persistent thoughts, and feelings we didn’t even realise we had.
“I hope this project helps others – even if it’s just once – to discover more of themselves and each other through the writing process.”
Sophia Thakur, an award winning, best-selling author and performance poet who has even taken to the stage at Glastonbury agrees: “At first, I found the sudden stillness of 2020 precious. Necessary even. Until I realised how much time we would be spending with our thoughts and feelings. For me it opened a floodgate of new revelations about self. Poetry and art is a way to tap into our thoughts, worries and truths and make sense of our internal happenings during this unsettling time.”
Entries can be uploaded and showcased on the online hub at www.bupafoundation.org/beyond-words.Teachers and students will also be able to access inspiration work from authors and mental wellbeing resources. A selection of entries may also be published in an anthology.
Alex Cole, Chair of the Bupa Foundation said: “In this extraordinary time of Covid-19, Black Lives Matter and climate crisis, it’s never been more important for young people to have time and space to express themselves. Beyond Words for World Mental Health Day provides a platform for young people to put words to their feelings and share their perspectives to help others.”
Ali Mawle, Director of Learning and Public Engagement at Cheltenham Festivals said: “We’ve witnessed first-hand the enormous impact Beyond Words has had on the lives of young people in Gloucestershire who, through physical or mental illness, have been too ill to attend school. Creative writing has been a lifeline for them. We are proud to work in partnership with Bupa Foundation, Mind and the National Literacy Trust so that all young people across the country can take part.”
Jonathan Douglas, Chief Executive of the National Literacy Trust, said: “During lockdown, many children and young people turned to creative writing as a way to make sense of the extraordinary times we are living in. Giving young people the freedom to explore their thoughts and feelings through creative writing can unlock their imaginations, aspirations and academic potential, while providing them with an essential coping mechanism for difficult situations and emotions. Creative writing will continue to play a vital role in young people’s lives, so we must do everything we can to nurture this – starting with encouraging all young people to take part in Beyond Words for Mental Health Day.”
Paul Famer, Chief Executive Officer of Mind, said: “The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has affected mental health across the country, but children and young people are facing the brunt of it. Nearly half of young people we recently surveyed reported poor or very poor mental health during lockdown, compared to less than a third of adults. Despite some schools and normal activities starting again, the toll of the pandemic and uncertainty we all still feel cannot be underestimated.
“We want to thank the Bupa Foundation for choosing to donate to Mind, and for encouraging young people to share their feelings about how they’ve found this difficult year. The donations will help fund Mind’s vital services, such as our information and advice tailored to children and young people, as well as the campaigning we do to ensure everyone with a mental health problem gets the support and respect they deserve.”

Stoke Reads partners with International Paper Company to bring educational support to local families – Education Today,['News'],"September 17, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/stoke-reads-partners-with-international-paper-company-to-bring-educational-support-to-local-families/,"600 families have received exciting activity packs thanks to a partnership between Stoke Reads and the International Paper Company.
Distributed via local 15 primary schools, each pack contained writing activities, craft ideas, puzzles and a section of high quality paper and card for families. Some of the writing activities were based on Story Quest, an initiative run by Stoke Reads and funded by Sport England that encourages families to explore their local areas by following a story trail packed with local facts, history and physical challenges.
The response from local schools was really positive. A teacher from Belgrave Saint Bartholomew’s Academy, who sent her class home with the packs at the end of term, said:
“Our children were so excited to receive them and couldn’t wait to get started at home. They were such a massive support in allowing the children to develop their reading and writing skills over the summer break!”.
 
Providing important support during lockdown
The National Literacy Trust released research on National Writing Day (24 June 2020) showing that writing helped children and young people process and cope with feelings of worry, anxiety and uncertainty around the coronavirus pandemic. Over 2 in 5 (41%) children and young people said that writing makes them feel better and 1 in 4 (25%) said that writing helps them when they feel sad that they can’t see friends and family. Many children and young people attributed this rise to lockdown providing them with the inspiration and conditions they need to write more creatively, such as having more time and space to think and generate ideas.
Since lockdown restrictions limited families’ access to these outdoor spaces, the Stoke Reads team swiftly adapted delivery and created a series of indoor Story Quest challenges that families could do in their own home. The activity pack included a space-themed Story Quest and a guide to creating your own Story Quest around your home.
Other highlights included an easy to follow, step-by-step guide to creating your own miniature book, a novel and accessible way for children to creatively chronicle their lockdown experiences. The packs were printed on high quality white and coloured REY paper (an International Paper brand), and featured brand mascot ‘Rey Bear’ starring in activities with his friends including origami, word games and puzzles.
 
Antony Mackie, International Paper Country Manager United Kingdom & Ireland, said:
“Literacy is a signature cause for International Paper, and we are very happy to support and contribute to the Stoke Reads campaign. We relocated our UK office to Stoke-on-Trent in 2019 and want to make a positive impact to the surrounding communities. This campaign makes a difference to families in the local area, and I’d like to thank National Literacy Trust for letting us be part of it”.
Lois Bateman, Story Quest Project Manager, said:
“We’re thrilled to have received this generous donation from International Paper Company. The families we work with are grateful for physical supplies to help them keep their children entertained.
“The Stoke Reads team have seen the effect creative expression has had on children’s wellbeing over lockdown so we’re so pleased to be able to share these high quality activities with so many families. We’d love to see the work children create with the materials in the packs; please share it with us on the Stoke Reads Facebook page!”.

Scottish students can accelerate economic recovery – Education Today,['News'],"September 16, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/scottish-students-can-accelerate-economic-recovery/,"Scottish Institute for Enterprise responds to Scottish Technology Ecosystem Review 
Scottish Institute for Enterprise (SIE) – which supports students across Scotland to develop enterprise skills, discover their entrepreneurial talent and start their own ventures – has welcomed the recent Scottish Technology Ecosystem Review.
The report, by Mark Logan and commissioned by the Scottish Government, is a detailed assessment of the technology sector, highlighting how Scotland can accelerate the maturity of its tech ecosystem with education a fundamental enabler to achieving economic success. SIE already plays a critical national role in this ecosystem through empowering innovative students of any discipline to start tech-enabled businesses. 
Fiona Godsman, chief executive at Scottish Institute for Enterprise, said: “SIE wholly welcomes the recommendations as set out in the report and we agree that we must build on our current tech ecosystem. 
“Whilst the tech sector is important it is also important to recognise that Scotland has excellence across a diverse range of entrepreneurs and all start-up ventures can be harnessed in a bid to aid Scotland’s economic recovery. Tech, whilst seen by many as a standalone sector, now underpins every industry – whether that’s beauty, agriculture or engineering – and this will become even more apparent in the years ahead.”
Funding, education and infrastructure have already been earmarked as the three pillars to influence the performance of the ecosystem as proposed by Logan. With education at the heart, SIE has called for more emphasis to be put on the role that universities and colleges have to play as catalysts for and facilitators of economic recovery. The early instilling of an enterprising mindset in students of all disciplines is foundational for an entrepreneurial economy. 
The report suggests that the output of the new technology ecosystem should be a stream of technology start-ups that reach sustained profitability, including a significant proportion that do so at scale with consequential benefits in opportunity for our people, in job creation and in tax revenues.
Fiona Godsman continued: “In order to achieve this output we should recognise the importance of multidisciplinary start-up ventures – innovative ideas come from a wide range of disciplines and having that diversity of thinking is absolutely crucial in growing the flow of students into the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Whilst technology and computing skills will be vital to economic recovery, we must pair such skills alongside others for Scotland to successfully achieve a robust economic recovery. 
“Across the nation through our universities and colleges, we already have access to budding entrepreneurs which is a result of the institutes taking a proactive approach to integrating innovative and enterprise thinking within the curriculum. This, in my opinion, is the stage that we need to capitalise on now and into which additional investment should be focused.”
By supporting education bodies and institutes across Scotland, SIE has enabled hundreds of students to accelerate start-up ventures including former Dundee University medical student, Chris McCann. His tech business, Current Health which provides a digital platform for medical staff to monitor patient health, was nurtured through the specialist support available collectively through SIE and the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem, and has gone on to achieve remarkable success across the globe. 
University of Strathclyde alumni, Rebecca Pick, founded Pick Protection which develops ground-breaking solutions for lone worker and employee protection and received support from SIE when starting her business. 
Rebecca commented: “Scotland already has a fantastic range of resources, support and funding opportunities for entrepreneurs and students alike who have innovative ideas that need nurtured. There’s a pool of talent awaiting to be unlocked across the country and ensuring that even more students can access the existing range of support will accelerate our economic recovery.”
Many of the recommendations being put forward in the report are already underway in Scotland, particularly on the education front, so creating new platforms may not be necessary. Instead, SIE suggests that we should harness and amplify the progress that is already being made. 
Fiona concluded: “Vital to enabling the technology ecosystem, as coined in the report, is working together with decision-makers, education bodies and importantly, students. The report shines a light on the potential we have here in Scotland to create a future-proofed economy and with the right investment, time and understanding as suggested within the recommendations, collectively we’ll deliver a strong economic recovery.”",scottish institute for enterprise responds to scottish technology ecosystem review scottish institute for enterprise sie which support student

Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) to continue to fund apprentices – Education Today,"['Apprenticeships', 'News']","September 16, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/education-and-skills-funding-agency-esfa-to-continue-to-fund-apprentices/,"Gillian Keegan, apprenticeship and skills minister, announced yesterday that a Statutory Instrument had been laid out in parliament to allow the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) to continue to fund apprentices to complete their training if they are at least 75 per cent of the way through their programme at the point of redundancy.
The HomeServe Foundation, a not-for-profit arm of leading home repairs company HomeServe Plc, is launching later this month with the goal of dramatically increasing the number of apprentices in the UK by supporting employers to take on and train more apprentices.
In reaction to this announcement, Helen Booth, Director of HomeServe Foundation said:
“Businesses across the UK have faced an incredibly challenging period through the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the Brexit deadline looming the future is still very uncertain for so many.
“Without doubt, apprentices have been some of the worst hit during the pandemic, with many unable to complete their training through no fault of their own. With apprenticeship numbers expected to decline by as much as 50%, it’s important for government and businesses to step up.
“It’s unclear when this change may come into place, but if passed it would mean that a significant number of apprentices will have the opportunity to complete their training and continue their career path in the future, which is welcome news.
“Whilst it’s great to see the government bringing in measures to support the apprentice workforce, we’re yet to see if this will make a significant impact.  We know that through apprenticeships, young people have the opportunity to build and learn skills that are vital for the UK’s economy and so we’ll continue to do what we can to support both employers and apprentices during this time.”",gillian keegan apprenticeship and skill minister announced yesterday that a statutory instrument had been laid out in parliament to allow the education and skill funding agency esfa to continue to fund apprentice to complete their training if they are at least per cent of the way through their programme at the point of redundancy the homeserve foundation a notforprofit arm of leading home repair company homeserve plc is launching later this month with the goal of dramatically increasing the number of apprentice in the uk by supporting employer to take on and train more apprentice in reaction to this announcement helen booth director of homeserve foundation said business across the uk have faced an incredibly challenging period through the covid pandemic and with the brexit deadline looming the future is still very uncertain for so many without doubt apprentice have been some of the worst hit during the pandemic with many unable to complete their training through no fault of their own with apprenticeship number expected to decline by a much a it important for government and business to step up it unclear when this change may come into place but if passed it would mean that a significant number of apprentice will have the opportunity to complete their training and continue their career path in the future which is welcome news whilst it great to see the government bringing in measure to support the apprentice workforce were yet to see if this will make a significant impact we know that through apprenticeship young people have the opportunity to build and learn skill that are vital for the uk economy and so well continue to do what we can to support both employer and apprentice during this time,"['employer', 'plc', 'launching', 'month', 'apprenticeship', 'parliament', 'homeserve', 'deadline', 'yesterday', 'brexit']"
Leeds Primary School prepares for all eventualities by supplying Google Chromebooks to 450 pupils – Education Today,"['Computing', 'Digital learning', 'News']","September 16, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/leeds-primary-school-prepares-for-all-eventualities-by-supplying-google-chromebooks-to-450-pupils/,"Every child from year 2 upwards at Little London Community Primary School will receive a Google Chromebook
Internet access will be provided for 150 families with limited or no access at home
Innovative project supported by Next Generation IT and Google Education

As schools return after a six-month hiatus, one Leeds school has used great vision to guarantee access to learning for every child from year 2 and above, some 450 pupils. Little London Community Primary School has taken the bold step of ensuring these children will have their own Google Chromebook and internet access so they are covered for every eventuality.
The scheme is the brainchild of Jill Wood, head teacher at Little London Community Primary School, who recognised that a ground-breaking solution was needed post-lockdown. Little London is an inner-city school of 630 children, where the proportion of disadvantaged pupils is much higher than the national average. Pupils have extremely limited access to technology and the internet outside school. A quarter of families have either no internet access, or limited access through a mobile phone, making home learning impossible.
Little London Community Primary School has taken delivery of new Chrome Books for their pupils.Pictured are some of the pupils with headteacher Jill Wood and Steven Lightfoot of Next Generation IT.
Jill enrolled the help of local IT provider, Next Generation IT, along with Google Education to provide a ground-breaking solution. Next Generation IT will begin the Google Chromebook rollout for pupils this month. Secure filtered Internet access will be provided to the 150 families currently without. Each family will receive a 4G router with pre-loaded data which will only work with the managed Chromebook supplied.
Jill Wood, head teacher at Little London Community Primary School, said: “We knew we had to deliver a bold solution to ensure that all pupils have access to learning. The return of pupils in September was never going to be straightforward however we have prepared for every eventuality by providing technology that will help all pupils reach their potential.
“Our teachers have done an amazing job of producing top quality lessons that can be delivered online, but children need to be able to access them. We needed to make sure children had their own device that was safe and used purely for education and Steven from Next Generation IT has come up with the perfect solution. The Governors have been extremely supportive of the project and are devoted to ensuring learning for the future. The Chromebooks can be used at home and at school and we see them as an essential tool for learning.”
The school has worked with Next Generation IT for over 15 years and has recently opted for Google Classrooms to be setup through DfE grant funding. This made the Google Chromebook solution the natural choice for the school, with an easy roll out solution for all students, allowing safe and secure access to learning. The Google Chromebook project is being funded by the school.
Steven Lightfoot, director of Next Generation IT, said: “Jill Wood is a true visionary and it has been amazing to work with her on this project. Getting the right support for the children drives Jill every day and we were delighted to partner with Google Education to provide a solution that is truly life-changing for the children.
“We will be supporting the school and families during the rollout and look forward to continuing to work with them closely. It’s great to know that whatever happens with schools as they return to their ‘new normal’, the children of Little London Primary School will be equipped to learn whenever and wherever they need to.”
Next Generation IT is the education support department of Pudsey Computers. The company started 30 years ago and is currently supporting or supplying around 70 schools across Leeds Bradford and Kirklees.",every child from year upwards at little london community primary school will receive a google chromebook internet access will be provided for family with limited or no access at home innovative project supported by next generation it and google education a school return after a sixmonth hiatus one leeds school ha used great vision to guarantee access to learning for every child from year and above some pupil little london community primary school ha taken the bold step of ensuring these child will have their own google chromebook and internet access so they are covered for every eventuality the scheme is the brainchild of jill wood head teacher at little london community primary school who recognised that a groundbreaking solution wa needed postlockdown little london is an innercity school of child where the proportion of disadvantaged pupil is much higher than the national average pupil have extremely limited access to technology and the internet outside school a quarter of family have either no internet access or limited access through a mobile phone making home learning impossible little london community primary school ha taken delivery of new chrome book for their are some of the pupil with headteacher jill wood and steven lightfoot of next generation it jill enrolled the help of local it provider next generation it along with google education to provide a groundbreaking solution next generation it will begin the google chromebook rollout for pupil this month secure filtered internet access will be provided to the family currently without each family will receive a g router with preloaded data which will only work with the managed chromebook supplied jill wood head teacher at little london community primary school said we knew we had to deliver a bold solution to ensure that all pupil have access to learning the return of pupil in september wa never going to be straightforward however we have prepared for every eventuality by providing technology that will help all pupil reach their potential our teacher have done an amazing job of producing top quality lesson that can be delivered online but child need to be able to access them we needed to make sure child had their own device that wa safe and used purely for education and steven from next generation it ha come up with the perfect solution the governor have been extremely supportive of the project and are devoted to ensuring learning for the future the chromebooks can be used at home and at school and we see them a an essential tool for learning the school ha worked with next generation it for over year and ha recently opted for google classroom to be setup through dfe grant funding this made the google chromebook solution the natural choice for the school with an easy roll out solution for all student allowing safe and secure access to learning the google chromebook project is being funded by the school steven lightfoot director of next generation it said jill wood is a true visionary and it ha been amazing to work with her on this project getting the right support for the child drive jill every day and we were delighted to partner with google education to provide a solution that is truly lifechanging for the child we will be supporting the school and family during the rollout and look forward to continuing to work with them closely it great to know that whatever happens with school a they return to their new normal the child of little london primary school will be equipped to learn whenever and wherever they need to next generation it is the education support department of pudsey computer the company started year ago and is currently supporting or supplying around school across leeds bradford and kirklees,"['lightfoot', 'teacher', 'classroom', 'brainchild', 'internet', 'online', 'headteacher', 'chromebook', 'chromebooks', 'google']"

nasen widens SEND support with free membership for all from January 2021 – Education Today,"['Charity', 'News', 'SEND']","September 15, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/nasen-widens-send-support-with-free-membership-for-all-from-january-2021/,"nasen, a charity that supports and champions those working with, and for, children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and learning differences, has announced that nasen membership will be free for all individuals across the UK from January 4th 2021.
Following a comprehensive consultation with members last year, nasen’s new free membership will replace the current tiered model, to ensure the organisation’s expertise in SEND is available to every school and setting across the UK.
Membership will include access to shared information, research, Continuing Professional Development and Learning (CPDL) training and webinars from the Whole School SEND Consortium, hosted by nasen, to ensure every child and young person with SEND can achieve their potential at school.
Professor Adam Boddison, CEO at nasen, said: “As a leading charitable membership organisation, nasen is committed to representing and championing the SEND workforce. Now more than ever, it is important that every part of the education workforce – from SENCOs to senior leaders, teachers to TAs, local authorities to leadership boards and beyond – is equipped to understand, identify and support those with SEND and learning differences.
“By opening access to our membership for free, we can collectively work to ensure all children and young people – particularly those with SEND and learning differences – can succeed in education and thrive. Breaking down the barriers that impact children and young people’s participation in education is even more critical following the long period of social upheaval that all families and professionals have experienced.”
nasen free membership will offer individuals a range of benefits including:
● Access to the most up-to-date knowledge and support rooted in research and evidence-informed best practice to support the education workforce to become effective, inclusive practitioners
● Exclusive online access to nasen Connect magazine six times a year, packed with advice, analysis and opinions on the current topics and future trends impacting on the SEND workforce
● Easy-to-access information through nasen’s e-communications including monthly member newsletter, resource news blasts, sector newsflash and much more featuring news, practical advice, training and CPDL tips, policy and sector updates and partner discounts from a range of selected SEND organisations
● Continued access to our comprehensive and new look SEND Gateway, a one-stop-shop for SEND home to information and resources from the Whole School SEND Consortium alongside wider SEND publications, events and the independent SEND Forums e-communities www.sendgateway.org.uk
Boddison continues: “We want to represent the collective voice of our members to contribute to the national debate on key issues and effect real and tangible change to improve outcomes for early years, schools, post-16 and wider settings and ultimately, the children and young people that they support.
“Our work in the coming months, and over 2021, will include a wide range of opportunities for peer-to-peer sharing and influencing policy and practice. We are currently calling for SENCOs to share their experiences of working in schools generally, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the 2020 National SENCO Workforce Survey, led by our partner Bath Spa University.”
In addition to the free membership offer, nasen will continue to lead targeted programmes and projects to deliver widespread improvements, including offering a new range of paid-for SEND services in the UK and internationally.
nasen’s SEND CPDL Annual Webinar Pass, introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to support professionals to easily access topical CPDL opportunities, is available now, offering subscribers at least 30 webinars per academic year on key topics such as The Identification of SEN Post Lockdown, and An Introduction to Mental Health Needs.
From January 2021, a range of additional services will launch, including the SENCO Support Service, available to anyone in a SENCO role from early years to further education to answer questions or tackle issues around SEND in education.
nasen’s work also spans the delivery of international programmes of support with membership available to international colleagues for £50 a year.

National Literacy Trust launches new digital platforms for parents and teachers to support literacy of children most affected by COVID-19 – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Coronavirus', 'Literacy', 'News']","September 14, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/national-literacy-trust-launches-new-digital-platforms-for-parents-and-teachers-to-support-literacy-of-children-most-affected-by-covid-19/,"The National Literacy Trust has enlisted the support of its Patron, HRH The Duchess of Cornwall, and leading children’s authors to launch two new digital platforms for parents and teachers to support the literacy of children who have been most adversely affected by COVID-19.
School closures as a result of COVID-19 could see the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their better-off peers widen by as much as 75% to 16 months. This is a gap many may never recover from, as these children were already almost twice as likely as their better-off peers to leave primary school unable to read and write at level expected for their age and to leave secondary school without good GCSEs in English language and maths.
New research from the National Literacy Trust also found that, during lockdown, 1 in 4 (22.5%) parents said their children did not have access to books of their own or library books, while half of parents (50.1%) said they would like more digital resources to support their child’s literacy at home.
To help children who have fallen behind with their literacy and to safeguard children’s access to books and families’ access to literacy support in the event of future local lockdowns, the National Literacy Trust has launched a Virtual School Library http://virtualschoollibrary.org.uk to give every primary school child in the UK access to books all year round, and its new Words for Life website to provide families with fun activities to support their children’s literacy at home https://wordsforlife.org.uk. Kindred2, a charitable foundation, has supported the creation of both the Virtual School Library and Words for Life.
In an exclusive video, recorded during a visit to Ivydale Primary School in London last week, Her Royal Highness launches the charity’s new Virtual School Library. The Virtual School Library will provide all primary school children in the UK with a free ebook or audiobook, an exclusive video and engaging activities from a different beloved children’s author or illustrator every week. Partnerships with publishers including Bloomsbury Publishing, Bonnier Books and Penguin Random House will ensure the books and activities featured support children’s wellbeing through reading.
The Virtual School Library will give children vital access to books all year round, whether they are learning at school or at home. Its first guest school librarians are children’s authors Greg James and Chris Smith who have shared an exciting new video, a free audiobook from their Kid Normal series (published by Bloomsbury Children’s Books), some super literacy activities and their top three recommended children’s books.
The duo also feature in the launch video alongside author Katherine Rundell, who earlier this year collated The Book of Hopes (Bloomsbury Children’s Books) – a collection of poems, short stories and pictures from more than 110 authors and illustrators to comfort, inspire and entertain children during lockdown.
In the video, Rundell introduces The Book of Hopes, which is free to read exclusively on the National Literacy Trust’s website, and authors Greg James, Chris Smith and Rutendo Tavengerwei share their poems from the collection. Five primary school children who are supported by the National Literacy Trust’s work across the UK also share their very own jokes inspired by The Incredible Instant Joke-Creating Machine by Susie Day, which is also included in the collection.
In the video, HRH The Duchess of Cornwall said: “I love libraries. They are absolute treasure troves of knowledge, wisdom and hope. Enter a library and you will suddenly find you are able to walk through wardrobes and pop out of rabbit holes and play Quidditch and maybe even steal the Crown Jewels… I am delighted to launch the National Literacy Trust’s Virtual School Library. What a fantastic idea it is: a library that allows us to read books online, meet authors, see inside their writing rooms and enjoy reading activities – all from our own armchairs. I know children will have a fabulous time exploring it.”
The National Literacy Trust has also launched its words for Life website today, which is filled with simple, fun and educational tips, activities and resources to help parents support their children’s learning and literacy at home: https://wordsforlife.org.uk. Parents and families can expect themed book lists, quizzes, creative activities, tips and advice to help children of all ages to improve their reading, writing and communication skills from home.
The website brings together all of the National Literacy Trust’s existing digital support for parents in one place, including the charity’s hugely popular Family Zone, which supported more than 400,000 families with home learning resources during lockdown, and its Small Talk website, developed in partnership with the Department for Education’s Hungry Little Minds campaign, which provides parents of children aged 0-5 with simple activities to build into their daily routines to support their children’s early language development.
Jonathan Douglas, Chief Executive of the National Literacy Trust, said: “We must do everything we can to support the literacy, learning and wellbeing of all children as they return to school after such a significant disruption to their education, particularly those who have been hit the hardest. As the nation marks 150 years of state education, the new school year will see a marked change in how children are taught, with blended learning at school and at home, so we must also adapt how we support children, teachers and families through this transition.
“Our Virtual School Library will ensure children who need it most have access to the magical world of stories all year round while our Words for Life website will provide parents with the activities they told us they need to help support their child’s literacy at home. Together, we can ensure that the impact of COVID-19 does not last a lifetime for any child.”
Department for Education, said: “We are delighted that the National Literacy Trust has launched Words for Life to enhance the learning capabilities of children at home. This is a great example of Government and charities working together in our shared ambition to improve the outcomes for every child, no matter their background. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that learning at home is now more important than ever, and this site is a fantastic resource to enhance children’s education as they return to nursery and school.”

Aldermans’ new portable sink makes handwashing accessible and fun – Education Today,"['Buildings & Maintenance', 'News']","September 8, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/aldermans-new-portable-sink-makes-handwashing-accessible-and-fun/,"Alderman Tooling has launched a new cost-effective portable handwashing station for schools, to enable students and staff to wash their hands easily and safely.
Branded Jengu, the portable sink was originally developed for humanitarian use by the major engineering consultancy Arup, working in conjunction with the British Red Cross and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  Aldermans worked with Arup to adapt the design and create a cost-effective handwashing unit to help schools respond to the challenges of COVID-19.
The portable sinks require no plumbing as water is supplied from a container, and wastewater is also piped into a separate canister or direct into a drain where available.  This flexibility means that the sinks can be deployed indoors or outdoors, wherever needed.
Indoors, students can wash their hands near their classrooms, without needing to leave their designated areas or bubbles.  Outdoors, students can wash their hands in the playground as soon as they arrive, or before returning to classrooms after break times.
Operated with an easy-to-use foot pump, and accommodating soap and a mirror, handwashing becomes a fun experience for all ages, with minimal supervision needed.
The sinks are robust yet lightweight and can easily be moved by one person.  They can also be secured to the ground, if required.

Trials have taken place in schools during the summer term, with positive feedback.  Sandy Gardner, School Business Manager at the Maynard School in Exeter commented:
“Having a hands-free solution was extremely beneficial by reducing the risk of infection at a crucial time for the school. In fact, for many of our students washing their hands became a socially fun experience and they really enjoyed using the sinks! These sinks will inevitably prove to be an invaluable tool in ensuring high hygiene levels are maintained.”
Deploying Jengu hand washing stations demonstrates a duty of care and is also an important visual reminder for everyone to wash their hands regularly.

Becoming a Teacher: A Beginner’s Guide – Education Today,['News'],"August 21, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/becoming-a-teacher-a-beginners-guide/,"Teaching is considered a noble profession. Teachers help us pass on information from our past onto future generations. They offer guidance on all levels, from teaching the ABCs to explaining rocket science. Teachers aren’t as well compensated as some other professions, even though most professionals have to pass through their hands. If you are considering becoming a teacher, this guide is for you. Here are a few steps to follow.
1.      Be Absolutely Sure You Want to Teach
Why do you want to be a teacher? There are a few questions to ask to help you evaluate this:

Do you have the desire? It will help you hang on when things get tough.
Can you complete the requirements? There are some prerequisites that need to be met, like earning a degree and a teaching license.
Are you okay with the salary? Though the salary varies depending on various factors, it is lower than some other professions, and you need to be okay with that.
Do you have the necessary skills and talent? You need patience, charisma, willingness, and strictness, to name a few qualities.

One way you can be sure is to gain prior experience. You can do this by volunteering, shadowing teachers, or becoming a substitute. You will experience firsthand how it is to be in the teaching environment. One great thing about teaching is job satisfaction. Seeing your students better at the end of the school year than they were at the beginning is a great motivator.
2.      Determine What You Want to Teach
This is a two-fold point. First, you need to determine what age you want to teach. Secondly, you may also need to decide which subject you want to teach. Pre-school and elementary teachers have a broader curriculum. Teachers for these levels need to be knowledgeable in many disciplines. Teachers for older students like from middle school onwards can specialize in specific subjects. There is also the option of specializing in special needs education. Here, you will teach children with disabilities and developmental disorders. For special education, teaching does not follow age but knowledge base.
3.      Settle on How You Will Gain the Training
Every district has specific requirements they require their teachers to meet. Be sure to know what the prerequisites are. There are four key training options to consider:
a.      University-Based Training
This option means you go to school first, obtain the certificate then start teaching. Many districts require the teachers to have experience before they are licensed. Some teaching programs incorporate a teacher preparation program to help teachers gain this experience. This option may mean that you are in school for longer before you start teaching. University-based training can be expensive, so you may need to consider payment options like getting a scholarship or applying for financial aid.
b.      Teach First
The goal of Teach First is to eradicate educational inequality. They place top graduates in challenging schools for two years minimum. After a brief residential program, you begin teaching and earning immediately. This is a good option for those who want to start teaching quickly. It is also great for those who feel they may not be able to afford a university or college tuition. What’s more, you gain experience on the job eliminating the need for a preparatory program.
c.       School Direct
This is a great middle point between university training and Teach First. You start teaching in a single school immediately and attend school once a week. You have the option of paying for the university tuition or getting paid by the school. The choice available to you will depend on your experience level.
d.      School Centered Initial Teacher Training (SCITT)
In this case, you will approach a school directly and train with partnered institutions. SCITT is not as common as Teach First and School Direct. You usually need a pre-existing relationship with the school you approach.
There are some common things every teacher must learn. They include:

Psychology
Teaching methodologies
Special education
Curriculum and instructional designs
How to assess students

Platforms like essayservice can help you with crafting reports and essays to meet your coursework requirements.
4.      Get a Teaching License
You won’t always start teaching immediately you finish your training. Some schools and districts have to test you before giving you a teaching license. You may have to do some assessment tests like Praxis. Some students do this alongside their training so that they start teaching immediately.
Conclusion
Once you have met the necessary prerequisites, you can start looking for a job. Look for guides on how to draft good resumes and cover letters. Learn about how to conduct yourself at interviews. Finally, search for job vacancies. You can look through generalized boards, niche job boards, or specific school and district websites. When you get that job, do your best. Besides bringing up great future professionals, you may inspire some of your students to become teachers later on.",teaching is considered a noble profession teacher help u pas on information from our

Sarwar Khawaja: Motivation in Education – Education Today,['News'],"August 17, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/sarwar-khawaja-motivation-in-education/,"Sarwar Khawaja
In 2017, Sarwar Khawaja received the Brian Tracy International Excellence Award for services in education & research. The renowned Tracy presented Khawaja with the award at a business event in London. One thing both Tracy and Khawaja understand is the importance of motivation and inspiration when it comes to education and business. Here are 5 ways to motivate yourself, and to stay motivated, when learning and working.
1) Create Goals
The former American football player Lou Holtz once said that “If you’re bored with life – you don’t get up every morning with a burning desire to do things – you don’t have enough goals.” Goals aren’t just something to aim for, they’re also ways in which to measure your accomplishments. Whether you start out with small, manageable goals or aim for larger, more ambitious aspirations, goals help to locate where you are and what you need to do to achieve your dreams.
2) Celebrate Successes
However small the success, make sure you celebrate. Success could be as simple as getting through a difficult day, or completing a particularly challenging task. Reward yourself for those successes, as they’ll help you to progress. By celebrating your accomplishments, the road you’re taking towards your goals will be much easier to walk, and you’ll have more to motivate you along the journey.
3) Assess your Goals
Sometimes, it’s important to review your goals in order to understand if they’re still the right goals for you. During the course of your education or work, you may find your goals have changed, at which point you’ll need to revise those aspirations in order to stay motivated. If you feel your motivation to achieve is waning, it could be time to re-evaluate to ensure you don’t lose momentum. Reviewing and amending your goals is a positive sign that you’re able to focus on the correct destination.
4) Consider Deadlines
Benjamin Franklin once made the prescient point that “You may delay, but time will not.” Procrastination is an issue for all workers and students – it’s human nature. But in order to overcome that issue of time, it’s good practice to create deadlines that you can stick to in order to ensure you don’t lose track of your aims. However, make sure they’re achievable deadlines, and do give yourself time to rest and relax.
5) Be Optimistic
It’s not an easy concept to advise someone to be optimistic, but being positive is a key way of maintaining focus. Sometimes, positivity can be accomplished through sheer will – focus on what benefits achieving your goals will bring you, and understand how success will improve your life. Other times, you may need to work to feel positive. This may involve taking a little time off to do something you enjoy, or focusing on things you know to bring you a sense of peace and happiness. Colin Powell once described “Perpetual optimism” as a “Force multiplier”. Where you can, harness optimism to help give you the extra energy and motivation to move forward.",sarwar khawaja in sarwar khawaja received the brian tracy international excellence award for service in education research the renowned tracy presented khawaja with the award at a business event in london one thing both tracy and khawaja understand is the importance of motivation and inspiration when it come to education and business here are way to motivate yourself and to stay motivated when learning and working create goal the former american football player lou holtz once said that if youre bored with life you dont get up every morning with a burning desire to do thing you dont have enough goal goal arent just something to aim for theyre also way in which to measure your accomplishment whether you start out with small manageable goal or aim for larger more ambitious aspiration goal help to locate where you are and what you need to do to achieve your dream celebrate success however small the success make sure you celebrate success could be a simple a getting through a difficult day or completing a particularly challenging task reward yourself for those success a theyll help you to progress by celebrating your accomplishment the road youre taking towards your goal will be much easier to walk and youll have more to motivate you along the journey ass your goal sometimes it important to review your goal in order to understand if theyre still the right goal for you during the course of your education or work you may find your goal have changed at which point youll need to revise those aspiration in order to stay motivated if you feel your motivation to achieve is waning it could be time to reevaluate to ensure you dont lose momentum reviewing and amending your goal is a positive sign that youre able to focus on the correct destination consider deadline benjamin franklin once made the prescient point that you may delay but time will not procrastination is an issue for all worker and student it human nature but in order to overcome that issue of time it good practice to create deadline that you can stick to in order to ensure you dont lose track of your aim however make sure theyre achievable deadline and do give yourself time to rest and relax be optimistic it not an easy concept to advise someone to be optimistic but being positive is a key way of maintaining focus sometimes positivity can be accomplished through sheer will focus on what benefit achieving your goal will bring you and understand how success will improve your life other time you may need to work to feel positive this may involve taking a little time off to do something you enjoy or focusing on thing you know to bring you a sense of peace and happiness colin powell once described perpetual optimism a a force multiplier where you can harness optimism to help give you the extra energy and motivation to move forward,"['student', 'london', 'dream', 'business', 'deadline', 'american', 'celebrating', 'morning', 'bored', 'football']"
Fimatix Launches Shield for Schools – UK’s First Leading Independent Boarding School to Implement an Independent COVID-19 Track and Trace System – Education Today,"['Buildings & Maintenance', 'News']","August 6, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/fimatix-launches-shield-for-schools-uks-first-leading-independent-boarding-school-to-implement-an-independent-covid-19-track-and-trace-system/,"Fimatix has launched a track and trace kit developed especially for schools, in time for the start of the autumn term. Shield for Schools uses Bluetooth wristbands linked to a desktop control system to allow schools to immediately detect and isolate anyone in school who has been in contact with infected students or staff members.
Buckswood School in East Sussex is the UK’s first leading independent boarding school to implement an independent track and trace system of this kind. Shield for Schools will be available to roll out to other interested schools across the UK and around the world.
Tim Howarth, Managing Director for Financial Services, at Fimatix said: “We created Shield for Schools to play a positive role in the management of risk and to give pupils, families and schools additional reassurance and peace of mind during these challenging times. By allowing real time contact tracing of the entire school community, we’re helping to ensure that everything possible is being done to make the most of a COVID-19 free learning environment.”
Kevin Samson from Buckswood commented: “We believe that this technology provides a key component in our school’s ability to manage Covid-19, enabling us as a school to instantly identify and isolate students who have been in close contact with anyone who tests positive. Additionally, Shield for Schools is an extremely useful tool in being able to quickly provide important information to Public Health England and the NHS should there be a need to track and trace individuals outside of our school community. It allows us to minimise wider isolation of staff and students, thus minimising the impact on education for all whilst at the same time providing an extra layer of reassurance for parents.”
Mark Taylor, Executive Director of Taylor Education, who are closely involved in Shield for Schools, added: “We have worked in partnership with independent schools over the last 10 years – assisting in their strategic planning. This is certainly the most challenging time schools have ever experienced. Working with the Boarding School’s Association, independent schools have developed policies and procedures that can give students, parents and staff confidence that independent schools are doing everything possible. A robust strategy of testing for the virus coupled with Fimatix’s track and trace Shield for Schools, complements and builds on the BSA guidance and allows schools to demonstrate that they are creating the most virus free learning environments possible. By introducing the track and trace systems, schools are given the edge in making risk based decisions, based on clinical assessment.”
With students, teachers and staff wearing Bluetooth wristbands from the first day of term, and having been trained on the new system, Shield for Schools follows three steps. Should a student or member of staff report feeling ill or have positive COVID-19 test results, the system administrator will be notified, log the data and the individual will be isolated as part of the first step. Step two involves cross checking the wristband ID with other wristband IDs on the Shield for Schools dashboard. The school will then perform isolation, retesting and safety protocols as part of the third step, helping to protect the wider school community and minimise disruption to learning.
The Shield for Schools algorithm is designed by medical experts to comply with latest Public Health England guidance on social distancing and contagion prevention and only the schools themselves will have access to, and manage, data relating to pupils and staff.
While the first phase of Shield for Schools is being implemented in leading UK independent boarding schools, the system is also being made available to other interested schools. Fimatix are also implementing bespoke test, track and trace solutions for businesses and workplaces looking for additional reassurance and risk management as teams return to work in offices.
Fimatix is a leading Fintech and Govtech business. With a team of over 150 staff, partners and associates, Fimatix Group’s purpose is to enhance the productivity of business, governments and organisations to the benefit of economies, communities and people around the world.

HIGH IMPACT CAMPAIGN TO UNMASK THE HIDDEN FACES OF DESPAIR – Education Today,['News'],"July 28, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/high-impact-campaign-to-unmask-the-hidden-faces-of-despair/,"A leading suicide prevention charity has launched a new campaign urging young people to face up to their feelings of desperation and get help.
PAPYRUS Prevention of Young Suicide says a happy, confident smile may mask true feelings of anxiety and fear.
The charity hopes its high-impact campaign will provoke a response among young people and others who are concerned for someone who may be having thoughts of suicide.
Ged Flynn, Chief Executive of PAPYRUS, said: “There is much debate about face masks just now. For some, masks are seen as protective; for others, masks are an obstacle or a barrier.
“Young people often find it difficult to express their emotions, especially when their circumstances change. Lockdown is a good example of how a sudden change can have a huge impact on young people. Staying at home, working or learning in a new environment, having less privacy and having less access to friends, families and colleagues, all mitigate against feeling safe and emotionally well.
“I would urge us all to help young people navigate the new normal and not to wait for them to struggle or suffer. We all need to find new ways of enabling our young people to be themselves, to express themselves, to share their challenges as well as their achievements.
“Children and young people are often grieving, reacting to the losses which come with change. We need to help them learn how to live through these difficult times. PAPYRUS is here to support you and them to enable life, however difficult this can be just now, and ultimately to prevent harm and death.
“There are many hidden faces of despair out there and they need to know there is someone to talk to and that help is available.”
HOPELINEUK is the charity’s confidential helpline service which is staffed by trained professionals. Practical advice and support is available by ringing 0800 068 4141, texting 07860 039967 or by email to pat@papyrus-uk.org.
The artwork for the PAPYRUS campaign was created by the award-winning agency TBWA Manchester. Gary Fawcette, Executive Creative Director, said: “At a time when it has never been more important to wear a mask and particularly when more people than ever are possibly struggling with their mental health, these images will hopefully remind people to keep talking.”
In 2017 PAPYRUS and TBWA collaborated on the award-winning social media campaign #BraveFace, which contained similar messaging around suicide, openness and young people helping one another.
PAPYRUS says these and a number of other hard-hitting campaigns play an important role in supporting young people, engaging and equipping local communities and helping to shape suicide prevention strategies.
“Ged Flynn from PAPYRUS added: “If you are a young person who is struggling and not showing how you really feel, don’t suffer in silence. Please talk to us.
“If you are a parent who is worried about your child, or you are concerned about someone else who could be thinking of taking their own life, look closely and reach out to them before it’s too late.”

How To Encourage Parents To Send Their Children Back To School This September – Education Today,['News'],"July 20, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/how-to-encourage-parents-to-send-their-children-back-to-school-this-september/,"As schools prepare to reopen, many teachers are apprehensive about how many students will actually be returning.
After all, many parents are uneasy about sending their kids back to school, and this might make your preparations difficult.
While keeping kids at home might seem like a viable option for many parents, homeschooling could leave them behind and mean that they struggle to achieve the qualifications that they need to succeed in the future.
As such, you should work with parents to help them understand that your school is doing its best to keep their precious children safe. Here are some handy tips to help you encourage parents to send their children back to school next term.
Ask For Feedback
Your school will never be able to meet parents’ expectations if it doesn’t know what they are. As such, you should communicate with parents to find out what they want your school to do to keep their children safe, and then see how viable each solution is so that you can implement as many as possible. If parents are making unreasonable demands based on false information, then communicate with them and inform them of the truth about the virus and how it spreads.
Work With A Professional Cleaning Company
Show parents that you are committed to keeping your school clean and safe for their children by working with a professional cleaning company. Ideal Cleaning specializes in commercial cleaning and works with a wide range of schools and education providers, so the team can offer a tailored solution that meets your needs and ensures that your school is clean and safe in time for the new term and that it stays that way.
Follow Government Advice To The Letter
Many parents are turning to the government for advice and information, so make sure that your school follows government guidelines and abides by every regulation. It can be confusing when the government makes contradictory statements but do your best to interpret their information correctly and make the best possible decisions for your students and staff.
Install Hand Sanitizer Stations Throughout Your School 
As the virus is transmitted through water droplets, touching your face and skin can help the virus to spread. The best way to reduce the spread is to keep your hands clean and avoid touching your face, but this can be tough for kids, especially young ones. Install hand sanitizer stations throughout your school so that they can always keep their hands clean and reduce the spread of the virus.
Embrace Technology
Shared textbooks and printed handouts could harbour germs and be unsafe, so instead embrace technology. Consider installing projects in every classroom, so that teachers can show the entire class visual resources that they can’t touch. This approach will save your school a lot of wastage and money, as well as making it safer for children and teachers alike. Check out projectors that use remote controls, so that staff don’t have to touch as many surfaces",a school prepare to reopen many teacher are apprehensive about how many student will actually be returning after all many parent are uneasy about sending their kid back to school and this might make your preparation difficult while keeping kid at home might seem like a viable option for many parent homeschooling could leave them behind and mean that they struggle to achieve the qualification that they need to succeed in the future a such you should work with parent to help them understand that your school is doing it best to keep their precious child safe here are some handy tip to help you encourage parent to send their child back to school next term ask for feedback your school will never be able to meet parent expectation if it doesnt know what they are a such you should communicate with parent to find out what they want your school to do to keep their child safe and then see how viable each solution is so that you can implement a many a possible if parent are making unreasonable demand based on false information then communicate with them and inform them of the truth about the virus and how it spread work with a professional cleaning company show parent that you are committed to keeping your school clean and safe for their child by working with a professional cleaning company ideal cleaning specializes in commercial cleaning and work with a wide range of school and education provider so the team can offer a tailored solution that meet your need and ensures that your school is clean and safe in time for the new term and that it stay that way follow government advice to the letter many parent are turning to the government for advice and information so make sure that your school follows government guideline and abides by every regulation it can be confusing when the government make contradictory statement but do your best to interpret their information correctly and make the best possible decision for your student and staff install hand sanitizer station throughout your school a the virus is transmitted through water droplet touching your face and skin can help the virus to spread the best way to reduce the spread is to keep your hand clean and avoid touching your face but this can be tough for kid especially young one install hand sanitizer station throughout your school so that they can always keep their hand clean and reduce the spread of the virus embrace technology shared textbook and printed handout could harbour germ and be unsafe so instead embrace technology consider installing project in every classroom so that teacher can show the entire class visual resource that they cant touch this approach will save your school a lot of wastage and money a well a making it safer for child and teacher alike check out projector that use remote control so that staff dont have to touch a many surface,"['reopen', 'textbook', 'education', 'apprehensive', 'student', 'class', 'classroom', 'parent', 'homeschooling', 'teacher']"
Association of Colleges responds to government guidance on reopening colleges and schools in September – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'FE colleges', 'Further Education', 'News']","July 2, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/association-of-colleges-responds-to-government-guidance-on-reopening-colleges-and-schools-in-september/,"Today the Department for Education has published guidance to support colleges to fully reopen in September. Responding to the announcement by the Education Secretary, Chief Executive of the Association of Colleges, David Hughes said: “Since the outbreak of COVID19, colleges have been pragmatic and acted swiftly to protect student safety, whilst also protecting their continued access to learning and training. Students should be confident that they will continue to receive a high quality education with great pastoral support as colleges continue to increase the numbers of students able to return to their sites.
“This guidance offers some clarity to college leaders and staff planning for the safe reopening of their building and campuses in September, but they should continue to make their decisions based on health and safety advice and their local context.
“There is no doubt that much of the teaching in colleges will need to be a blend of online and on-campus delivery, and colleges have learned a lot about how that mix can work best for different groups of students. Colleges will all be facing different challenges in September and will know what works best for them in regards to the amount of teaching and learning to keep online and the students or provision that have an urgent need for face-to-face delivery.
“It is right that the government has focused on getting young people back into education and training as quickly as possible, but there remains a gap that needs to be plugged. Students leaving school face an uphill challenge to get back on track with their learning, colleges are preparing to help them as much as they can but they need the same catch up support that have been given to their peers in schools. Anything less is indefensible.
“Government must also look urgently into how they safely bring adults back into education and training. It cannot be right that an adult can now go to the pub with their mates, but they cannot undertake an assessment to complete their construction course, even when things have been put in place to make it safe to do so.
“Colleges are working extremely hard to ensure they are ready to offer the best experience to their new and returning students. There are still questions that will need clarification ahead of September, including around transport, minimising contact and mixing and for students with a work experience or placement element to their studies. They also need to clarify funding rules that will allow colleges to deliver all that is being asked.
“AoC will continue to work with officials to ensure students and staff can transition back into colleges safely when the new term arrives.”",today the department for education ha published guidance to support college to fully reopen in september responding to the announcement by the education secretary chief executive of the association of college david hughes said since the outbreak of covid college have been pragmatic and acted swiftly to protect student safety whilst also protecting their continued access to learning and training student should be confident that they will continue to receive a high quality education with great pastoral support a college continue to increase the number of student able to return to their site this guidance offer some clarity to college leader and staff planning for the safe reopening of their building and campus in september but they should continue to make their decision based on health and safety advice and their local context there is no doubt that much of the teaching in college will need to be a blend of online and oncampus delivery and college have learned a lot about how that mix can work best for different group of student college will all be facing different challenge in september and will know what work best for them in regard to the amount of teaching and learning to keep online and the student or provision that have an urgent need for facetoface delivery it is right that the government ha focused on getting young people back into education and training a quickly a possible but there remains a gap that need to be plugged student leaving school face an uphill challenge to get back on track with their learning college are preparing to help them a much a they can but they need the same catch up support that have been given to their peer in school anything le is indefensible government must also look urgently into how they safely bring adult back into education and training it can not be right that an adult can now go to the pub with their mate but they can not undertake an assessment to complete their construction course even when thing have been put in place to make it safe to do so college are working extremely hard to ensure they are ready to offer the best experience to their new and returning student there are still question that will need clarification ahead of september including around transport minimising contact and mixing and for student with a work experience or placement element to their study they also need to clarify funding rule that will allow college to deliver all that is being asked aoc will continue to work with official to ensure student and staff can transition back into college safely when the new term arrives,"['increase', 'today', 'college', 'announcement', 'education', 'training', 'teaching', 'september', 'reopen', 'reopening']"
Innovating Minds teams with childhood trauma expert to help children impacted by domestic violence during lockdown – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Secondary schools', 'Social issues']","July 1, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/innovating-minds-teams-with-childhood-trauma-expert-to-help-children-impacted-by-domestic-violence-during-lockdown/,"Clinical psychologist Dr Asha Patel (left) of the multi award-winning social enterprise Innovating Minds is running a series of webinars on essential mental health topics and is partnering with author Jane Evans to create The Healing Together Facilitator Programme.
The course is aimed at those who work with children at both primary and secondary schools or in other community settings. It will help individuals become trauma aware and give them the skills and understanding to help children who have been impacted by domestic abuse and violence.
The United Nations has called domestic abuse the ‘shadow pandemic’ as it estimates incidents globally have increased by at least 20 per cent.
Researchers at the Counting Dead Women Project have told UK MPs that 14 women and two children were killed in the first three weeks of lockdown – the largest number of killings in a three-week period for 11 years and more than double the average rate.
The NSPCC has confirmed a shocking increase in calls to their service, ‘Contacts to our helpline about the impact of domestic abuse on children have increased by 32% since the start of the lockdown, to an average of one an hour’.
Jane Evans (right), who is based in Wiltshire, is known internationally for her work with parents and children. She’s also the author of a number of books to which help adults explore discuss difficult issues with children including one on domestic abuse called How Are You Feeling Today Baby Bear?
Innovating Minds, based in Birmingham, is a not for profit which has consistently provided support and funding for children who have witnessed domestic abuse. Asha Patel believes that there will be a tsunami of referrals to statutory mental health services once lockdown finishes and waiting lists will spiral out of control.
The course will upskill schools, social workers, early help workers and community organisations to deliver support to children impacted by domestic abuse.
‘Early intervention is crucial to a child’s emotional wellbeing and education.’ said Asha. ”This course will enable children to access therapeutic help from people they trust, in a space where they feel safe. This is a unique programme as every aspect (videos, worksheets, training) has been developed through a trauma informed lens. Experience has shown us at Innovating Minds that this is the best strategy, as children need to connect with their bodies and feelings to aid their journey to recovery.’

Basil Brush and Martin Roberts team up to help kids in lockdown – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'KS2', 'Literacy', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Wellbeing']","June 18, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/basil-brush-and-martin-roberts-team-up-to-help-kids-in-lockdown/,"Perhaps not surprisingly, one of the side effects of lockdown has been the huge pressure on the mental health of our children. Charities like the NSPCC and its Childline service have counselled thousands of children struggling to cope with the current situation. At the same time, schools are trying to find ways to help children continue their learning whilst at home. An unlikely celebrity pairing and a new initiative with a friendly fox at the helm should help with both issues.
Best known for his 17 years hosting BBC TV property auction show Homes under the Hammer, Martin Roberts is also an established children’s book author.
Martin has enlisted the support of legendary children’s entertainer and all round good fox, Basil Brush, to create a charming narrated and partially animated version of Sadsville, a magical and whimsical illustrated book from his ‘Herman and the Magical Bus to The Villes’ series. The recording has just been released on YouTube for general viewing, and is also being sent out with an accompanying home study pack FREE to all primary schools in the UK, with a view to them passing it on to their pupils.
Roberts wrote Sadsville in support of the invaluable work of the NSPCC and Childline. It contains an emotional well-being self-help guide and details of how to contact Childline. It forms part of the campaign to help children’s mental well-being that is the mainstay of the author’s own charity The Martin Roberts Foundation (reg no 1172905) which aims to give a free copy of the physical book to every child in year 4 (8 & 9 year olds) in the UK. So far over 30,000 books have been distributed, with more to come.
Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC says: “Currently, we are hearing from children in their thousands who have been cut off from vital support networks such as school and friends, and that has increased their feelings of loneliness and vulnerability. However, there are many more out there who are suffering in silence, which is why we are doing all we can to let children know we are still here for them.
“Using Basil Brush to narrate Sadsville is a unique and entertaining approach to letting even more children know how they can contact Childline if things are tough, and I am confident it will be very successful.”
Martin Roberts comments: “I have my own kids aged 10 and 13 so I understand the pressures that lockdown has put on young people.
“The Villes is a series of magical and whimsical books aimed at children aged 6 to 10. In Windyville it’s always windy, in Tiredsville everyone is always tired, in Latesville everyone is always late, in Sadsville everyone is always sad… and so on… and the reader has to work out why.
“The books in general encourage problem solving and fire the imagination in readers of all ages. Sadsville in particular encourages children to question their own emotions and ‘think outside the box’ as to why they may be struggling with unhappiness. It helps them find ways to feel happier and to reach out for support if they need it.”
Basil Brush says: “It was a booming pleasure to be part of Mr Martin’s wonderful book, to read his lovely story and help the NSPCC and their Childline service at the same time. The illustrations are perfect, but for some reason I felt peckish at the end – you’ll know why when you read it. It might even bring a tear to your eye …”

The competition is a drawing contest for children, aged between four and eleven. NYMR is inviting parents who are home schooling due to the current pandemic to encourage their children to think about what the railway might have looked like during wartime and put pen to paper to draw their interpretation of it.
During the second world war, Britain’s railways were used more heavily than at any time in their history and played a pivotal role in evacuating thousands of children and transporting them to safety, as well as delivering vital supplies across the breadth of the country.
Drawing competition entries should be submitted via nymr.co.uk/drawing-competition by Friday 28 August at 5pm and will be shortlisted by Chris Price, General Manager of NYMR. Once the top designs have been chosen, voting for the winning candidate will be handed over to the public to decide via the railway’s social media channels.
The winner will be announced on 9 October, during what would have been the Railway in Wartime event that usually welcomes more than 30,000 visitors.
Chris Price, General Manager of NYMR said: “This is a wonderful opportunity to teach children about the past as well as the importance of preserving our heritage railways. It was such a tough decision to have to cancel this year’s Railway in Wartime event due to the global pandemic, but we are so excited to see what the children come up with, and their interpretation of the Railway in Wartime. We’re hoping that this competition gives families the opportunity to get creative and feel inspired during these uncertain times.”

ExaClair launches PPE range to support schools re-open – Education Today,['News'],"June 15, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/exaclair-launches-ppe-range-to-support-schools-re-open/,"ExaClair, the UK subsidiary of office product and stationery brands such as Clairefontaine, Rhodia, Décopatch and Exacompta, has developed an extensive range of personal protective equipment, specifically developed to help meet the rapidly changing demands of businesses returning to a post-lockdown world.
With a factory in King’s Lynn in Norfolk, operational since 1967, the company is using its Europe-wide manufacturing expertise in filing, display, and desktop accessories to develop the ExaScreen range of protective screens. With entirely hermetic materials that are designed to prevent the spread of viruses and microbes, the ExaScreen range meets exacting European quality specifications.

Lawrence Savage, Marketing Manager at ExaClair, says the range has been developed with the goal of ensuring every work environment is safe for staff, customers and visitors: “The range offers a comprehensive set of solutions for social distancing within various locations, including offices, call centres, restaurants and other retailing outlets.”
The new ExaScreen landscape, portrait and hanging screens each feature a window for customer interactions, and desk partition screens provide clear desktop walls to offer excellent protection within open-plan office and educational establishments. The range also includes visors and facemasks with anti-bacterial and water-resistant properties, and signage products including standing and countertop sign holders, and magnetic display pockets and clipboards to help communicate COVID-19 rules and regulations in the workplace.

New competition for teachers looking to inspire their students in the world of food and farming – Education Today,"['Competition', 'Environmental Focus', 'KS4', 'News', 'Secondary schools']","June 10, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-competition-for-teachers-looking-to-inspire-their-students-in-the-world-of-food-and-farming/,"Leading farm education charity, LEAF Education in partnership with Coleg Cambria Llysfasi have launched the annual National Competition in Food, Farming and Environment. The competition, which is open to all secondary schools across the UK, is quick and easy to enter and asks teachers to explain why their students and school would benefit from winning an exclusive weekend experience on a real working farm at Coleg Cambria Llysfasi in October. Teachers can enter the competition between 8 June – 3 July by visiting www.leafuk.org/education/the-national-food-farming-and-environment-competition
The competition, supported by Waitrose & Partners, looks to engage young people with farming, food production and the natural environment.  Selected schools will go through to the final prize weekend in October at Coleg Cambria Llysfasi, in the beautiful Vale of Clwyd, North Wales.
Students will be immersed in practical farm activities such as milking cows, handling sheep, using drone technology, seeing agro-forestry in action and tractor driving. They will also compete in a debate around the competition’s theme ‘Will farmers continue to be the guardians of our land and environment?’ where they will cover a range of educational topics, such as climate change and natural capital and compete in answering a hypothesis during the weekend. At the end of the two days, the winning school team will be crowned the ‘Innovation school of the year 2020 in food, farming and environment’.
Now in its third year, the competition has had a significant impact in engaging and inspiring young people about farming and food production and highlight the many career opportunities available in the sector. In its first two years, of the 33 students who took part, 12 went on to apply to study at land-based colleges, with all students reporting that it had ‘positively changed their perception of the farming industry’ and that it had ‘helped them with their studies back at school’.
LEAF Education Director, Carl Edwards explained: “There has never been a more critical time to harness the strength of feelings our young people have for the future of their planet.  This competition addresses issues they care most about – sustainability, environmental protection, health and nutrition and climate change. By providing young people with first-hand experience of farming, food production and opportunities for deeper level, critical analysis around a current farming issue, our aim is to raise their awareness of the importance of farming in their everyday lives and its role in addressing the climate and ecosystem emergency.”
New for 2020, regional competitions are also being run by the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society and Embleton Hall Dairy, County Durham which will feed into the national competition. Schools in Jersey and the North East of England are encouraged to enter their regional competition to win a secured place at the national competition. The regional element will expand the profile and reach of the national competition as well as help drive wider industry support.
Iain Clarke, Head of Llysfasi added: “The importance of sustainable farming has never been so important in mitigating against climate change.  Young people feel strongly about the future of their planet and farming is under an intense spotlight; this competition provides a fantastic opportunity for students to gain first-hand experience of farming as well as consider how it is also part of the climate crisis solution.”
Speaking from Waitrose & Partners, supporters of this year’s competition, Caroline Silke, Social Impact Manager, concluded: “Young people are the consumers and decision makers of tomorrow. They are passionate about the future of their planet and farming is key to driving forward positive change. Strengthening connections with farming can help promote healthier lifestyles, drive demand for sustainably produced food and nurture an interest in the natural world. We are delighted to support this important initiative.”
The 2020 Food, Farming and Environment competition is for students aged 14 to 16-year olds.  Secondary schools wishing to apply should enter the competition here:

Alexandra Palace and Little Inventors launch The Wildlife Challenge – Education Today,"['Competition', 'Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'KS1', 'KS2', 'KS3', 'News', 'Science']","May 20, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/alexandra-palace-and-little-inventors-launch-the-wildlife-challenge/,"Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust and Little Inventors have today launched The Wildlife Challenge where budding young inventors aged up to 16 years old from the greater London area will be tasked with letting their imaginations run wild.
One of the biggest green spaces in London, Alexandra Park is home to over 319 different species – including 38 rare or protected species. The Wildlife Challenge will look to celebrate the space and the natural world by inviting young people to design a new invention to help one of the creatures found in the park. The winning inventions chosen by Alexandra Palace and Little Inventors, will be made into installations and displayed in the park later this year.
The young inventors taking part will be asked to research their chosen animal considering where they live, what they eat, what dangers they might face, how they move and what they need to stay healthy before they start their designs. The inventions, which could be anything from an animal’s dream home to a state-of-the-art feeding station, should be submitted as drawings using the upload page on the Alexandra Palace website. The deadline for all inventions is the 31st July 2020.
The launch of the Wildlife Challenge is being supported by CBBC presenter Naomi Wilkinson.  It is the second collaboration between Little Inventors and Alexandra Palace. In 2019, children across Haringey, Hackney, Waltham Forest, Islington, Camden, Enfield and Barnet were invited to come up with a new invention inspired by the innovative spirit of famous adventurers, aeronauts and by Alexandra Palace, which has itself been home to inventors and innovators for the past 140 years. Four of the designs were chosen, made into models and displayed in the newly opened Creativity Pavilion in Alexandra Palace’s East Court.
Louise Stewart, Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust chief executive said: “Creativity and invention is imbedded in the history of Ally Pally and the team we have here. This meant we were able to quickly move our creative learning programme, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, online and continue our work during the pandemic, to give young people the opportunity to participate and have a lasting input on the park. As a charity this programme is important to us, engaging different audiences in new ways and we are looking forward to seeing all the great ideas.”

National School Sport Week at Home: Youth Sport Trust and Sky Sports team up to unite the country through sport this summer – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Coronavirus', 'News', 'Sport & Play', 'Wellbeing']","May 20, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/national-school-sport-week-at-home-youth-sport-trust-and-sky-sports-team-up-to-unite-the-country-through-sport-this-summer/,"Children’s charity the Youth Sport Trust and Sky Sports have teamed up on a campaign to unite the country through sport and promote young people’s wellbeing this summer.
With millions of young people set to miss out on a school sport day, the Youth Sport Trust’s annual National School Sport Week campaign will this year be opened up to parents and families and reinvented as National School Sport Week at Home.
Taking place from 20 to 26 June, the UK-wide campaign will give families, communities, schools and sports clubs the opportunity to engage in a series of virtual sporting challenges which help young people capture the enjoyment, competition and camaraderie they have been missing out on during weeks of school closures and social distancing.
People can register to take part in the campaign from today. Anyone signing up will receive videos and activity cards to help them plan a series of challenges across the week for their families, neighbours, friends or colleagues.
In previous years National School Sport Week has seen thousands of schools join in a week-long celebration of school sport and Physical Education, and their important role enhancing young people’s wellbeing.
Sky Sports will supercharge this year’s campaign, helping to inspire families across the country to take part. This builds on a long-term relationship between the broadcaster and charity. In 2003 the Youth Sport Trust and Sky launched Sky Sports Living for Sport, with over half a million young people taking part in the initiative over a decade. The Youth Sport Trust is now a key charity partner for Sky Cares, Sky’s employee volunteering programme. Earlier this month the £75,000 commercial fees from the sportsmen and women whom appeared in the #IAmSport marketing film were donated by Sky Sports to the charity.
National Governing Bodies of sport will also be supporting the week, with several appointing stars of their sport as School Sport Champions.
Youth Sport Trust Chief Executive Ali Oliver said: “The Youth Sport Trust and Sky Sports share a passionate belief in the power of sport to change lives and unite us, even through the most difficult times. We are delighted that Sky Sports will be partnering this summer’s National School Sport Week at Home, helping us to support the millions of young people missing out on a school sport day this year.
“Right now, young people are missing their friends and missing the sense of connection they get through sport.
“Sport has such a crucial role to play in promoting young people’s wellbeing and this has never been more apparent than it is now. After weeks of isolation we hope that YST National School Sport Week at Home 2020 can help bring families, communities, schools and sports clubs back together.”
Sky Sports Managing Director Rob Webster said: “At Sky Sports we are all passionate about sport and the power it has to unite people. National School Sport Week at Home will help inspire schoolteachers and families all across the country to help get children active.  We are delighted to be able to help supercharge the campaign.”

Jobs and Careers in Hull after Graduation – Education Today,['News'],"May 12, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/jobs-and-careers-in-hull-after-graduation/,"If you have just graduated as an engineer, manufacturing expert, designer, environmentalist or marketing genius, there are graduate jobs in Hull waiting for you!
Hull and the surrounding area were once heavily reliant on the fishing industry and related jobs. However, these industries have been in a steady decline. Hence the reason why it is reported that those living in coastal regions of the UK earn £1,600 less on average per year than those in inland communities.
Despite the doom and gloom around seafaring jobs in Hull, the local industry has managed to reinvent itself into an epicentre for engineering, manufacturing and healthcare. Smith & Nephew, Seven Seas and BP are all major employers in the area today – and they are continually looking for the best graduate talent.
Where to Work in Hull after Graduation?
If you have recently graduated from the University of Hull or are a returning graduate to the area, you may be wondering what opportunities you can find in Hull. These opportunities have grown recently with plenty of new graduate jobs up for grabs. You can find these directly on employer sites or by searching for jobs in Hull on JobRapido.
Some great examples of graduate employers in Hull include:

The University of Hull: You can take up further study to earn a doctorate, research fellowship, or start working in the teams behind the scenes at the university.
Hull City Council: Work in the public sector on environmental programmes as well as housing or IT jobs.
BAE Systems: Get into a manufacturing, engineering or marketing graduate job here.
BP: Newly graduated engineers may be interested in working for BP and their exciting projects.
Associated British Ports: Just because seafaring jobs have declined does not mean they are dead. The industry still needs fresh-faced grads to keep the industry afloat.

Many of these companies have added automation to recruitment processes. So if you do apply, you are likely to find out if you have been successful quicker!
Hull’s Growing Industries
Hull has moved away from its maritime reputation, but just like any other location, it cannot cater to all graduates of different disciplines. Hull’s new-look job market is geared towards engineering and manufacturing, with some emphasis on healthcare and chemical engineering. These are complex and rewarding professions, meaning the pay for these jobs is usually lucrative.
Along with these types of roles, Hull also has a place for those working in sales and marketing. After all, these manufacturing companies also need other departments to complete their processes and operations. Moreover, Hull has just expanded its main shopping centre, providing further opportunity for graduate job growth.
Reasons to Work and Live in Hull
Hull is improving its reputation as a place to live and settle down after graduation. Alongside enhanced career prospects for graduates, those living in Hull can also tap into vibrant urban life, as well as cheaper living costs. Compared to London and bigger norther cities, Hull offers much more affordable living costs and is close to many other locations where graduates may find work, including Lincoln (36 miles), York (38 miles) and Grimsby (32 miles).",if you have just graduated a an engineer manufacturing expert designer environmentalist or marketing genius there are graduate job in hull waiting for you hull and the surrounding area were once heavily reliant on the fishing industry and related job however these industry have been in a steady decline hence the reason why it is reported that those living in coastal region of the uk earn le on average per year than those in inland community despite the doom and gloom around seafaring job in hull the local industry ha managed to reinvent itself into an epicentre for engineering manufacturing and healthcare smith nephew seven sea and bp are all major employer in the area today and they are continually looking for the best graduate talent where to work in hull after graduation if you have recently graduated from the university of hull or are a returning graduate to the area you may be wondering what opportunity you can find in hull these opportunity have grown recently with plenty of new graduate job up for grab you can find these directly on employer site or by searching for job in hull on jobrapido some great example of graduate employer in hull include the university of hull you can take up further study to earn a doctorate research fellowship or start working in the team behind the scene at the university hull city council work in the public sector on environmental programme a well a housing or it job bae system get into a manufacturing engineering or marketing graduate job here bp newly graduated engineer may be interested in working for bp and their exciting project associated british port just because seafaring job have declined doe not mean they are dead the industry still need freshfaced grad to keep the industry afloat many of these company have added automation to recruitment process so if you do apply you are likely to find out if you have been successful quicker hull growing industry hull ha moved away from it maritime reputation but just like any other location it can not cater to all graduate of different discipline hull newlook job market is geared towards engineering and manufacturing with some emphasis on healthcare and chemical engineering these are complex and rewarding profession meaning the pay for these job is usually lucrative along with these type of role hull also ha a place for those working in sale and marketing after all these manufacturing company also need other department to complete their process and operation moreover hull ha just expanded it main shopping centre providing further opportunity for graduate job growth reason to work and live in hull hull is improving it reputation a a place to live and settle down after graduation alongside enhanced career prospect for graduate those living in hull can also tap into vibrant urban life a well a cheaper living cost compared to london and bigger norther city hull offer much more affordable living cost and is close to many other location where graduate may find work including lincoln mile york mile and grimsby mile,"['doctorate', 'dead', 'environmental', 'jobrapido', 'employer', 'graduate', 'healthcare', 'seafaring', 'fishing', 'environmentalist']"
"Sandwell College shows support for local NHS staff, key workers and former students with giant rainbow tribute – Education Today","['Coronavirus', 'News']","May 12, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/sandwell-college-shows-support-for-local-nhs-staff-key-workers-and-former-students-with-giant-rainbow-tribute/,"Located in the heart of West Bromwich, the College’s seven-storey site will be home to the area’s largest rainbow display, joining a trail across the country that has become a symbol of kindness, solidarity and courage during the Coronavirus pandemic.
The installation will be accompanied by pictures from nearby nurseries and schools, whose pupils are invited to share their own messages of thanks to key workers.
With many of its former students now working in the healthcare and medical sector, Sandwell College hopes the rainbow will also send a signal of support for alumni on the frontline, who are currently playing a key role in responding to the pandemic.
Since graduating from Central Saint Michael’s Sixth Form in 2014, Pavanjit Kaur is now a Foundation Year 1 Doctor in general surgery. After her final rotation was cancelled due to the Coronavirus outbreak, Pavanjit’s portfolio will be signed off two months early, and she credited Sandwell College for giving her many of the skills that have helped her work through the challenging conditions.
Pavanjit commented: “There has been a lot of uncertainty over the last couple of months, however I’ve found that being able to quickly adapt is crucial – particularly as new medicine is always changing. Looking back, my time at college definitely shaped my skills and lay the foundations for me to become a more resilient person, which has been hugely important when coping with the recent events.”
Graham Pennington, Principal of Sandwell College, commented: “We’re extremely proud to see how our former students are contributing to the response against Coronavirus, and want to let them know how grateful we are for their services.
“Sandwell College is an active member within the local community, and we want our rainbow to build a sense of togetherness and hope for anyone who sees it over the coming weeks. We will continue to support both current and future students, adult learners, and the amazing NHS staff and key workers during this incredibly difficult time.”
Whilst college doors have been closed, staff have continued to provide students with vital support, including essential care packages, online teaching resources and regular phone calls, whilst resources from the Fab Lab have been used to produce face visors for the NHS.

Why The Education Sector Is Choosing Modular Construction For Schools – Education Today,"['Buildings & Maintenance', 'News']","May 11, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/why-the-education-sector-is-choosing-modular-construction-for-schools/,"Preparing for the new school year isn’t just about setting lesson plans. Ensuring that the school is capable of accommodating the new influx of pupils is paramount to ensuring a safe and comfortable training environment for all.
Schools that are looking to improve, extend or build new classrooms and educational facilities are turning, more and more, to modular construction; not just for temporary classroom use, whilst the facility is being built, but for the actual permanent building too.
Modular buildings have recently hit the headlines as hospitals around the UK have utilised this method of off-site construction to quickly erect safe and secure centres for hospital staff to work in and test for Covid-19. The method of building inside a facility before erecting the building on-site cuts down on-site construction time considerably which is why the healthcare industry is actively looking at modular construction over its traditional brick-built counterpart.
For a long time, modular buildings, also known as prefabricated buildings, have been mistaken for nothing more than a cabin or basic shell of a building. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Modular school buildings can be externally designed using thermowood cladding, triple-glazed glass and uPVC fascias whilst the buildings themselves can accommodate all the facilities your school may require, from laboratories to canteens and everything in-between, with plumbing, electrics and IT infrastructure installed.
Cotaplan, one of the leading modular building companies in the UK, were the first to meet the strict, eco-friendly and environmentally efficient Passivhaus Passivclass standards in the UK with the construction of Smallwood Primary School in South West London. Their efforts have seen them construct other Passivhaus builds, such as the sensory education facilities at Linden Lodge in Wimbledon, as well as other standard, bespoke modular builds for nurseries and schools across the UK. With modular construction a fraction of the cost of traditional builds, and with a shorter time to completion date, it’s no wonder that the education sector is moving towards this more efficient method of construction.",preparing for the new school year isnt just about setting lesson plan ensuring that the school is capable of accommodating the new influx of pupil is paramount to ensuring a safe and comfortable training environment for all school that are looking to improve extend or build new classroom and educational facility are turning more and more to modular construction not just for temporary classroom use whilst the facility is being built but for the actual permanent building too modular building have recently hit the headline a hospital around the uk have utilised this method of offsite construction to quickly erect safe and secure centre for hospital staff to work in and test for covid the method of building inside a facility before erecting the building onsite cut down onsite construction time considerably which is why the healthcare industry is actively looking at modular construction over it traditional brickbuilt counterpart for a long time modular building also known a prefabricated building have been mistaken for nothing more than a cabin or basic shell of a building this couldnt be further from the truth modular school building can be externally designed using thermowood cladding tripleglazed glass and upvc fascia whilst the building themselves can accommodate all the facility your school may require from laboratory to canteen and everything inbetween with plumbing electric and it infrastructure installed cotaplan one of the leading modular building company in the uk were the first to meet the strict ecofriendly and environmentally efficient passivhaus passivclass standard in the uk with the construction of smallwood primary school in south west london their effort have seen them construct other passivhaus build such a the sensory education facility at linden lodge in wimbledon a well a other standard bespoke modular build for nursery and school across the uk with modular construction a fraction of the cost of traditional build and with a shorter time to completion date it no wonder that the education sector is moving towards this more efficient method of construction,"['installed', 'hospital', 'built', 'build', 'laboratory', 'healthcare', 'training', 'prefabricated', 'education', 'classroom']"
NASUWT: “PM’s announcement does little to assuage teachers’ concerns” – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'News', 'Unions']","May 11, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/nasuwt-pms-announcement-does-little-to-assuage-teachers-concerns/,"Responding to last night’s statement from the Prime Minister, Dr Patrick Roach, General Secretary of the NASUWT – The Teachers’ Union, said:
“The Prime Minister’s statement that it would be “madness” to risk a second spike in transmission of the Coronavirus highlights the need for extreme caution. Regrettably, the Prime Minister’s announcement is likely to provoke confusion and does not address the genuine concerns that have been raised by teachers.
“The Prime Minister’s announcement lacks the clarity of statements issued by Ministers in Scotland and Wales who have reaffirmed the key ‘stay at home’ message. The Government’s announcement that schools in England might reopen to more children from 1 June risks thousands of schools rushing to make decisions about how best to safeguard the health and safety of children and staff in the absence of any clear national guidance.
“It is baffling that following the Government’s decision to close all schools on public health grounds that the Government now expects individual schools to work out for themselves whether or not it will be safe to reopen on 1 June and potentially put at risk the health of children, staff and the public. With no date yet set for when the Government’s guidance will be forthcoming, school leaders in England are being placed in an extremely difficult position of being asked to draw up plans affecting lives of children and their teachers.
“These announcements will do little to assuage teachers’ concerns about the premature reopening of schools. The Government must with the utmost urgency address teachers’ concerns or expect to lose the goodwill of the profession. Unless and until the Government can demonstrate that schools will be safe for staff and children, all schools should continue to limit their opening only to vulnerable children and to children of key workers.
“The NASUWT will continue to press the Government on the need for clear guidance and stringent and enforceable health and safety risk assessment measures to be in place in every school prior to relaxing the current restrictions. The UK Government’s message to be responsible and to ‘stay alert’ will ring hollow with teachers who are still being denied access to appropriate PPE and who have been given no clear guidance about how social distancing can be practiced in school settings.
“Notwithstanding the Government’s five tests, the bottom line is that no teacher or child should be expected to go into schools until it can be demonstrated that it is safe for them to do so.”",responding to last night statement from the prime minister dr patrick roach general secretary of the nasuwt the teacher union said the prime minister statement that it would be madness to risk a second spike in transmission of the coronavirus highlight the need for extreme caution regrettably the prime minister announcement is likely to provoke confusion and doe not address the genuine concern that have been raised by teacher the prime minister announcement lack the clarity of statement issued by minister in scotland and wale who have reaffirmed the key stay at home message the government announcement that school in england might reopen to more child from june risk thousand of school rushing to make decision about how best to safeguard the health and safety of child and staff in the absence of any clear national guidance it is baffling that following the government decision to close all school on public health ground that the government now expects individual school to work out for themselves whether or not it will be safe to reopen on june and potentially put at risk the health of child staff and the public with no date yet set for when the government guidance will be forthcoming school leader in england are being placed in an extremely difficult position of being asked to draw up plan affecting life of child and their teacher these announcement will do little to assuage teacher concern about the premature reopening of school the government must with the utmost urgency address teacher concern or expect to lose the goodwill of the profession unless and until the government can demonstrate that school will be safe for staff and child all school should continue to limit their opening only to vulnerable child and to child of key worker the nasuwt will continue to press the government on the need for clear guidance and stringent and enforceable health and safety risk assessment measure to be in place in every school prior to relaxing the current restriction the uk government message to be responsible and to stay alert will ring hollow with teacher who are still being denied access to appropriate ppe and who have been given no clear guidance about how social distancing can be practiced in school setting notwithstanding the government five test the bottom line is that no teacher or child should be expected to go into school until it can be demonstrated that it is safe for them to do so,"['regrettably', 'premature', 'urgency', 'distancing', 'teacher', 'reopen', 'madness', 'reopening', 'june', 'coronavirus']"

The Smallpeice Trust and the RAF to donate Think Kits to schools – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'Engineering', 'News', 'Resources', 'State schools', 'STEM']","April 30, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-smallpeice-trust-and-the-raf-to-donate-think-kits-to-schools/,"Children’s education charity, The Smallpeice Trust, and the RAF have joined forces to donate engineering-based ‘Think Kits’ to the schools remaining open to support vulnerable children and students of key workers, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this time of need, many UK schools are continuing to provide emergency learning and support for children who have no other place to go. In recognition of the incredible work that these schools and teachers are carrying out, The Smallpeice Trust and the RAF have partnered to provide engaging science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) activities for groups of students.
The Think Kits include all the materials and tools necessary for groups of students to work in teams and build an electrically powered glider, supporting the development of their creativity and engineering skills while having fun in the classroom.
The RAF has generously purchased 50 Think Kits at a cost of £250 per kit and The Smallpeice Trust will match this with an additional 50. The Think Kits will be donated to non-selective state schools across nine regions in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The goal of the Think Kit challenge is to see which group’s glider can travel the furthest over two flights made within 10 minutes of each other. Students are involved with the complete design and construction process, enabling them to experience a hands-on approach to STEM.
The project will last up to a total of nine weeks; 20 students, split into five teams of four, will work on their own powered gliders. All students that finish their gliders will be eligible for a CREST Discovery Award and will receive a personalised certificate.
Dr Kevin P Stenson, chief executive of The Smallpeice Trust, said; “Giving students that are still in school, the opportunity to continue their STEM learning and develop a passion for engineering is a key priority for The Smallpeice Trust.
“We would like to show our gratitude and thanks to all schools and teachers for all of their efforts during this uncertain period, which is why we are donating Think Kits to all schools that remain open.”
Russell Barnes, Wing Commander at the RAF said, “In these difficult times we wish to support teachers by providing interesting and challenging activities that will offer a real educational benefit to students.”
The RAF, as well as The Smallpeice Trust, recognise the dedication and hard work being done by schools to support the nation’s response to COVID-19. Throughout these unprecedented times, teachers have shown their commitment to allowing students to continue their STEM education at school.

New ‘wild’ home learning hub helps parents be fun science teachers – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'KS1', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Science', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","April 24, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-wild-home-learning-hub-helps-parents-be-fun-science-teachers/,"Wildlife charity WWT has launched its new online ‘wild’ home learning hub to help hard pressed parents teach their primary school aged children key parts of the science curriculum.
New resources, covering different conservation science themes, will be released weekly on a Monday morning during lockdown.
WWT has 70 years’ experience in teaching school groups and its experts have tailored their wealth of curriculum-linked learning resources for use at home. Mini lesson plans have been adapted for parents, and divided up into bite-sized chunks, including an outdoors element. Separate plans have been created for five to seven and seven to eleven year olds.
WWT is sharing this expertise with families to help educate their young children in the building blocks of conservation science.
Mark Stead, National Learning Manager from WWT, said: “Under normal circumstances during the summer term, thousands of primary pupils would enjoy a school trip to one of our wetland centres, each of them leaving as a budding David Attenborough.
“And after decades of doing this, we’re sitting on a wealth of learning resources. So we thought, what better way to help out than to tailor them especially for parents at home, so you can easily keep your mini-conservationists up to speed with their curriculum.
“We’re releasing a new lesson each Monday. Just like Joe Wicks, but with science… and we promise you won’t pull a hamstring or get out of breath.”
These weekly lessons cover themes that WWT addresses daily such as climate change, migration, wildlife identification, and habitats. Parents can click on the hub for a full theme list. The lessons are supported by visual resources, ‘how to make’ videos and fun quizzes.
WWT’s ‘wild’ home learning hub is as fun as it is educational. It champions nurturing an emotional connection among children with the natural world, as well as curriculum-based learning. WWT hopes this will inspire the next generation to protect nature, something which society, during lockdown, is beginning to value more.
As well as the weekly ‘mini lesson’ content, the hub features a range of simple, ‘always available’ fun family activities such as spotter guides, colouring in sheets, and ‘how to build’ kit.

8 ways to keep fit while working from home – Education Today,['News'],"April 22, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/8-ways-to-keep-fit-while-working-from-home/,"By AJ Products
Working from home means you might miss out on walking or cycling as part of your commute and gives you even more excuses not to get up from your desk. Exercise isn’t just good for your physical fitness; it can also have an impact on your mental wellbeing, so it’s important to find alternative ways to stay active. There are lots of ways to create an active work environment that keeps you moving throughout the day. Here are some simple tips from AJ Products to help you to keep fit while working from home.

Go for a walk or run.
Make the most of the fact that you are allowed to get outside for daily exercise and try to go out every day no matter your fitness levels. Fresh air and a change of scenery will be good for both your physical and mental health. Make sure you follow all government guidelines and stay a safe two metres away from anyone not in your household.
Join in with a fitness video or online class
There are lots of workout videos available for free online as well as live online classes. One of the biggest benefits to working from home is that you can grab a quick shower after your workout and, unless you’re not on a video call, no-one will know if you wear your gym clothes to work!


Stand up to work
Standing at your desk is an easy and effective way to start moving more while you work. A sit-stand desk lets you sit for part of the day and then stand for part of it, making it easy for you to switch between the two. Being able to vary your position as you work can make a big difference to your overall wellbeing; standing has been shown to burn extra calories compared to sitting and helps break the dangerous cycle of too much sitting.


Try an active sitting chair
An exercise ball chair is a great way to combine your work with a workout. It forces you to work your core muscles to keep yourself upright and counteract the natural movement of the ball. Improve your fitness further by doing simple Pilates chair exercises.


Do a mini workout
Staying active can be as simple as incorporating basic exercises into your daily routine, such as sitting down and standing up ten times in a row or doing jumping jacks a few times each morning and afternoon.


Walk and work
Take a walk around the house at regular intervals. For example, you could make it a rule to always walk around while taking phone calls.


Run up and down the stairs
If you have stairs, run or walk up and down a few times a day. It’s an easy way to get extra steps in and get your heart rate up.
Get on your bike
If you have an exercise bike at home, take a 10 minute break from your work a few times a day to get your heart rate up. Short bursts of high-intensity activity will get your blood pumping and burn body fat.

Taking short breaks to get your body moving is not only good for your health, it can also help you focus better when you get back to work. Aerobic workouts can help improve memory, lower stress levels and give you more energy. Remember to look after your body in other ways too: eat healthily, stay hydrated and make sure you get enough sleep.

The Benefits of Automation in Recruitment – Education Today,['News'],"April 16, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-benefits-of-automation-in-recruitment/,"In the Golden Age of technology, automation is seen as the inevitable future and no one can deny that smart tech has made our lives a lot easier. But what does automation mean for recruitment? From targeted ads, CV scanners, application trackers, and psychometric testing, there is a lot technology can do to make the hiring process less painful for both recruiters and applicants.
It’s now estimated that 75% of recruiters surveyed now use some sort of recruitment software and 94% of them say it has improved their hiring process. Here’s just some of the ways that automation can benefit recruitment and make finding the perfect job a bit easier.
Reducing Costs
With costs estimated at 7k to 30k for making a hire, automation is being frequently used to save money. Technology is quicker, more accurate, and doesn’t take a break, so once it is programmed to do what is needed, it is much more efficient than people. This isn’t to say that the goal is to remove human recruiters because there will always be a need for person-to-person contact when hiring someone, especially when working within a team. However, automation makes recruiters’ lives a lot easier: they can work faster, have more data to work with, and can spend more time focusing on the right candidates instead of sorting through unsuitable CVs.
Automation also cuts costs in ways that can have long-term effects, making it even more valuable to use in the first place. If the hiring process is quicker and the candidates are better suited, then job satisfaction for recruiters and their new hires will increase. This means that employee retention can become higher and creates a better culture within the company, as well as reducing the costs that come with high staff turnover.
Smarter, Faster 
 One of the biggest benefits of automation in recruitment is the time saved. By getting technology to do the mundane and time-consuming tasks such as pre-screening, hiring staff can work through more candidates faster and without the information overload that is so common nowadays. While the internet means that job postings can be seen by thousands of people everyday, it also means that application numbers have sky-rocketed but in reality, only 2% of job applicants get interviews. By using automation to identify the best candidates, an enormous amount of time can be saved – both for employers and potential employees.
Pre-screening software can also reach out to successful and unsuccessful candidates as soon as the decision has been made, building relationships quicker than with a manual process, which can lead to a more satisfying job search. It is also more effective at storing information, meaning that when strong candidates aren’t chosen this time, they can be easily reconsidered for another position when it comes along. This builds a connection with candidates and a better brand for the company, which in turn encourages passive applicants to become active and answer the job adverts put out.
Better Reach
There’s a lot of information out there, so job adverts can get easily lost in the traditional spaces, and with low unemployment rates there is a good chance that a great candidate for the position is only passively looking for another job. This means they’re not scrolling through job listings for hours, but they’re open to a new opportunity should it make itself available. Around 98% of recruiters use LinkedIn and other social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook are becoming the go-to places to find jobs. Since these sites collect a huge amount of data from their users, their targeted advertising algorithms are pretty accurate and can help put adverts where they are more effective.
This is where programmatic job advertising comes in. All recruiters need to do is input their parameters and needs into the software, e.g. the budget for advertisements, number of applicants wanted, and what the target demographic is, then the computer does the hard work. Adverts pop up across the web, tracking down sites that may be niche, but the people that visit them may better match the demographic for those likely to be qualified for the job. This is like a web-wide targeted ad and companies have reported that using these softwares has reduced costs by 30-70% per qualified candidate.
Embracing Automation
Automation is changing every aspect of our lives, including the hiring process, so embracing technology and the benefits it can bring will help companies perform at their best in the modern age. Technology has made us more connected meaning that hiring has become more competitive for both candidates and employers. Companies like Picked  are using AI to improve the matching process. As AI software like Picked continues to improve, hiring can become faster, cheaper, more accurate, and even more human, removing the traditional grievances that job seeking brings. The more intuitive and efficient the recruitment process can be, the easier it is for both recruiters and candidates to show their strengths, so using automation can help everyone reach their full potential.",in the golden age of technology automation is seen a the inevitable future and no one can deny that smart tech ha made our life a lot easier but what doe automation mean for recruitment

"Learn to be an astronaut from home, with Tim Peake and STEM Learning – Education Today","['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'News', 'Space!']","April 16, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/learn-to-be-an-astronaut-from-home-with-tim-peake-and-stem-learning/,"Suitable for all ages from 4-19, STEM Learning has carefully selected more than 300 activities and materials available from its bank of over 14,000 free resources to support parents and carers with home learning, with a particular focus on STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and maths.
STEM Ambassador Tim Peake also features in a new video where he answers school children’s questions about how to become an astronaut. He reveals whether astronauts worry about loo roll running out, discusses pre-launch quarantine and COVID-19 on the International Space Station, and even predicts that one day children will be going into space.
This content joins a number of astronomical-themed activities for budding space travelers, including ‘Mission X’ which encourages students to train like an astronaut and a Moon Camp Challenge to design a moon camp, with space providing an engaging and exciting way for children to learn about science and mathematics.
Other fun, hands-on STEM activities that can easily be carried out at home include how to bounce an egg using nothing but vinegar, using jelly to learn about how things dissolve and identifying solids and liquids, building helicopter spinners, and learning about the spectrum of light while making ‘Thank You NHS’ rainbows.
Other available advice for parents includes how to maintain your child’s wellbeing as a result of Coronavirus and a survival guide for parents who are home learning for the first time. For extra support, STEM’s subject experts are available weekdays from 8:30am to 4.30pm via a webchat, accessible on all of STEM’s webpages.
STEM Learning is the UK’s the largest provider of education support in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). STEM Learning is a non-profit, working with schools, colleges and others working with young people, including providing resources for both parents and teachers.
Over the coming months, the activities and materials will be supported with regular video content from other famous STEM Ambassadors.
STEM Ambassador Tim Peake says: “I was fortunate enough to become an astronaut, but even if I hadn’t there are so many interesting and exciting careers in space and aviation that are all made possible by STEM subjects. The most important thing, regardless of what field you’d like to work in, is to follow what you’re passionate about; work hard at it, be determined and, while there will be ups-and-downs along the way, you will always see it through.”
Fran Dainty, STEM’s Head of Education added: “Supporting families with home learning has never been more important, but there’s no reason for it to be daunting; that’s why we’ve published more than 300 activities and materials; free for everybody. Not only are they enjoyable and easy to do, but fun, and the parents here at STEM have been writing blogs about their own science experiments, tips and experiences, which are also available to read.
“Not only will these activities help inspire the next generation of astronauts, scientists and engineers, but also help both parents and teachers navigate upcoming summer term of home learning as smoothly as possible, with live chat also available to help with any questions or advice.”

Whilst maintaining social distancing guidelines, staff have been taking safe measures to deliver essential packages to students, to ensure they have vital supplies during the pandemic.

Upon its temporary closure, Sandwell College donated all surplus perishables to a local food bank within the community and to Elim Community Church in West Bromwich.
Graham Pennington, Principal of Sandwell College, commented: “These are extremely challenging circumstances for everyone and I am incredibly proud and grateful for my team’s dedication and their efforts to ensure that our students stay safe and secure, whilst enabling their continued access to learning and support.
“We would like to reassure all of our students and their families that we are here for you throughout this difficult time, and that any student who has been offered a place to join Sandwell College from September, or would like to apply, will still be able to do so.
“We thank our partners, stakeholders and most importantly all NHS staff and key workers, for their ongoing support and efforts in the fight against COVID-19.

MyTutor launches free online school for GCSE students – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'GCSEs', 'News']","April 3, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/mytutor-launches-free-online-school-for-gcse-students/,"The closure of schools as a result of preventative measures following the outbreak of coronavirus has affected thousands of children across the UK, and many students and parents have been worried about the uncertainty this will bring to pupils’ education. Today, Ofqual – the exams regulator – has released details of the standardised assessment process which will take their place. Schools and colleges will be asked to provide both a centre grade in each subject for each student and a rank order of pupils within each grade. If pupils are not happy with the result predicted for them, they can of course sit the exam in the autumn or next summer. Therefore, the necessity for vigilant education still remains.
MyTutor – the UK’s leading online tutoring service – in a bid to support those working diligently on their studies at home, have launched a new, free Online School which is packed with help for GCSE students. The platform offers daily live group tutorials on key GCSE topics and new resources are added every day. Pre-recorded videos focussing on popular topics are also uploaded to MyTutor’s YouTube channel regularly, across a wide range of subjects, but are currently centred around the core subjects: Maths, the three Sciences and English.
Now more than ever it is essential to provide access to crucial resources for students looking to continue their education from home. While schools are shut and the COVID-19 pandemic continues, this platform will remain free to help students and support schools in their efforts to present the GCSE curriculums at home.
James Grant  – Co-founder of MyTutor – discusses the need for private firms such as MyTutor to help support the public sector during this time:
“Pupils working in isolation from home because of containment measures could face learning challenges at a critical period. Fortunately, online platforms can be accessed in a convenient and hygienic way across the UK. MyTutor are incredibly pleased to launch this new service for GCSE students, which we believe will be a vital resource for those looking to continue their studies from home.
“MyTutor has advocated the use of EdTech in the classroom for a long time, and now we have the chance to assist schools, teachers and pupils as they work from home. We want to ensure we support all children with their continued learning during this tricky time and so are delighted to be able to provide this valuable and easily-accessible platform for free.”",the closure of school a a result of preventative measure following the outbreak of coronavirus ha affected thousand of child across the uk and many student and parent have been worried about the uncertainty this will bring to pupil education today ofqual the exam regulator ha released detail of the standardised assessment process which will take their place school and college will be asked to provide both a centre grade in each subject for each student and a rank order of pupil within each grade if pupil are not happy with the result predicted for them they can of course sit the exam in the autumn or next summer therefore the necessity for vigilant education still remains mytutor the uk leading online tutoring service in a bid to support those working diligently on their study at home have launched a new free online school which is packed with help for gcse student the platform offer daily live group tutorial on key gcse topic and new resource are added every day prerecorded video focussing on popular topic are also uploaded to mytutors youtube channel regularly across a wide range of subject but are currently centred around the core subject math the three science and english now more than ever it is essential to provide access to crucial resource for student looking to continue their education from home while school are shut and the covid pandemic continues this platform will remain free to help student and support school in their effort to present the gcse curriculum at home james grant cofounder of mytutor discus the need for private firm such a mytutor to help support the public sector during this time pupil working in isolation from home because of containment measure could face learning challenge at a critical period fortunately online platform can be accessed in a convenient and hygienic way across the uk mytutor are incredibly pleased to launch this new service for gcse student which we believe will be a vital resource for those looking to continue their study from home mytutor ha advocated the use of edtech in the classroom for a long time and now we have the chance to assist school teacher and pupil a they work from home we want to ensure we support all child with their continued learning during this tricky time and so are delighted to be able to provide this valuable and easilyaccessible platform for free,"['math', 'classroom', 'parent', 'autumn', 'exam', 'teacher', 'tutoring', 'tutorial', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic']"
Ofqual unveils GCSE and A level awarding details – Education Today,"['A levels', 'Coronavirus', 'GCSEs', 'News']","April 3, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/ofqual-unveils-gcse-and-a-level-awarding-details/,"Ofqual has now set out details for schools, colleges, students, parents & carers on how GCSEs and A levels will be awarded following the cancellation of this year’s exams.
For this summer’s awards, schools and colleges are being asked to provide centre assessment grades for their students. These should be fair, objective and carefully considered judgements of the grades schools and colleges believe their students would have been most likely to achieve if they had sat their exams, and should take into account the full range of available evidence.
Sally Collier, Chief Regulator, Ofqual, said: “School or college based assessment already has an important role in many GCSEs, AS and A levels and in extraordinary circumstances such as these, schools and colleges are best placed to judge the likely performance of their students at the end of the course.
“We have worked closely with the teaching profession to ensure that what we are asking is both appropriate and manageable, so that everyone can have confidence in the approach. I would like to take this opportunity to thank teachers and school leaders for making this process work for students during these very challenging times.
“We have published a message to students to reassure them that we, and exam boards, will do everything we can to make sure that, as far as possible, grades are fair and that they are not disadvantaged in their progress to sixth form, college, university, apprenticeships, training or work because of these unprecedented conditions.”
Exam boards will be contacting schools, colleges and other exam centres after Easter asking them to submit, by a deadline that will be no earlier than 29 May 2020, the following:

a centre assessment grade for every student in each of their subjects: that is, the grade they would be most likely to have achieved if they had sat their exams and completed any non-exam assessment. Judgements should balance different sources of evidence such as:

classwork
bookwork
any participation in performances in subjects such as music, drama or PE
any non-exam assessment – whether or not complete
the results of any assignments or mock exams
previous examination results – for example, for any re-sitting students or those with relevant AS qualifications
any other records of student performance over the course of study


the rank order of students within each grade for each subject – for example, for all those students with a centre assessment grade of 5 in GCSE maths, a rank order where 1 is the most secure/highest attaining student, and so on. This information will be used in the statistical standardisation of centres’ judgements – allowing fine tuning of the standard applied across all schools and colleges
a declaration from the Head of Centre making the submission

To make sure that grades are as fair as possible across schools and colleges, exam boards will put all centre assessment grades through a process of standardisation using a model being developed with Ofqual.

BBC “to deliver biggest push on education in its history” – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'News']","April 3, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/bbc-to-deliver-biggest-push-on-education-in-its-history/,"The BBC has unveiled its biggest push on education in its history – ensuring that every child in the UK has the opportunity to continue to follow the appropriate core parts of their nation’s school curriculum in these challenging times.  Whether complementing what schools are providing remotely, or as a standalone resource, the BBC’s newly expanded education offer will bring 14 weeks of educational programmes and lessons to every household in the country – whatever your child’s age.
Commencing on 20th April, the start of the summer term for most children, BBC Bitesize Daily, as the service will be called, will deliver a tailored day of learning across BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Bitesize website and app, BBC Four and BBC Sounds, with curriculum relevant offers across the UK.  Together, this comprehensive package is aimed at minimising disruption to children’s education and providing rhythm and routine in these challenging times.
Tony Hall, Director General of the BBC, said: “In these uncertain times parents look to the BBC to support them and offer education while children can’t be in school. This is the biggest education effort the BBC has ever undertaken. This comprehensive package is something only the BBC would be able to provide.
“We are proud to be there when the nation needs us, working with teachers, schools and parents to ensure children have access and support to keep their learning going – come what may.
“We have been overwhelmed by the offers of help and support in putting this provision together and are looking forward to ensuring every child can continue to learn, and have fun, through our high-quality teaching and accessible education offer.”
UK Government, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “Millions of parents are supporting their children to continue learning at home while schools are closed, to help slow the spread of coronavirus.
“As a parent, I know encouraging children to learn at home is no easy task and I am delighted that the BBC has worked with experts and exceptional teachers to create this educational package to support schools and parents by bringing learning to life on TVs, computers and tablets across the country.”
UK Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden said: “This is public service broadcasting at its best and will make a big difference to millions of children across the UK while schools are closed. I’m delighted the BBC is working closely with the government to help make sure our children are educated, informed and entertained during these challenging times.”
Faces children will already be familiar with such as Karim Zeroual, Oti Mabuse and Katie Thistleton will be part of Bitesize Daily which will be filmed in Match of the Day’s studio in Salford. Some of our nation’s best teachers will join big name partners across the worlds of sport, culture and literature such as the Premier League, the Royal Shakespeare Company and Puffin Books, who have also signed up to offer content and activities for both the BBC Bitesize Daily broadcast and BBC Bitesize Online with more exciting partnerships to be announced in coming weeks.
Navigating around the content will be simple for parents and children to follow as all content will be divided into age groups. From watching the 20 min programme on BBC iPlayer or BBC Red Button relevant to the child’s age, parents will be directed to the resources available that day for that child on BBC Bitesize online. BBC Bitesize online will home a new Maths and English lesson for every child every day with more subjects to follow. BBC Bitesize will be the one stop shop for all the educational resources whether that be podcasts, videos, quizzes and importantly lessons.
Working closely with teachers, well trusted education providers such as Twinkl and White Rose Maths, the Department of Education in England, the Welsh Government, Scottish Government and Northern Ireland Executive, the BBC will provide nation specific, curriculum led activities and programming to complement the remote learning being offered by schools and to keep up every child’s educational momentum.",the bbc ha unveiled it biggest push on education in it history ensuring that every child in the uk ha the opportunity to continue to follow the appropriate core part of their nation school curriculum in these challenging time whether complementing what school are providing remotely or a a standalone resource the bbcs newly expanded education offer will bring week of educational programme and lesson to every household in the country whatever your child age commencing on th april the start of the summer term for most child bbc bitesize daily a the service will be called will deliver a tailored day of learning across bbc iplayer red button bbc bitesize website and app bbc four and bbc sound with curriculum relevant offer across the uk together this comprehensive package is aimed at minimising disruption to childrens education and providing rhythm and routine in these challenging time tony hall director general of the bbc said in these uncertain time parent look to the bbc to support them and offer education while child cant be in school this is the biggest education effort the bbc ha ever undertaken this comprehensive package is something only the bbc would be able to provide we are proud to be there when the nation need u working with teacher school and parent to ensure child have access and support to keep their learning going come what may we have been overwhelmed by the offer of help and support in putting this provision together and are looking forward to ensuring every child can continue to learn and have fun through our highquality teaching and accessible education offer uk government education secretary gavin williamson said million of parent are supporting their child to continue learning at home while school are closed to help slow the spread of coronavirus a a parent i know encouraging child to learn at home is no easy task and i am delighted that the bbc ha worked with expert and exceptional teacher to create this educational package to support school and parent by bringing learning to life on tv computer and tablet across the country uk culture secretary oliver dowden said this is public service broadcasting at it best and will make a big difference to million of child across the uk while school are closed im delighted the bbc is working closely with the government to help make sure our child are educated informed and entertained during these challenging time face child will already be familiar with such a karim zeroual oti mabuse and katie thistleton will be part of bitesize daily which will be filmed in match of the day studio in salford some of our nation best teacher will join big name partner across the world of sport culture and literature such a the premier league the royal shakespeare company and puffin book who have also signed up to offer content and activity for both the bbc bitesize daily broadcast and bbc bitesize online with more exciting partnership to be announced in coming week navigating around the content will be simple for parent and child to follow a all content will be divided into age group from watching the min programme on bbc iplayer or bbc red button relevant to the child age parent will be directed to the resource available that day for that child on bbc bitesize online bbc bitesize online will home a new math and english lesson for every child every day with more subject to follow bbc bitesize will be the one stop shop for all the educational resource whether that be podcasts video quiz and importantly lesson working closely with teacher well trusted education provider such a twinkl and white rose math the department of education in england the welsh government scottish government and northern ireland executive the bbc will provide nation specific curriculum led activity and programming to complement the remote learning being offered by school and to keep up every child educational momentum,"['teaching', 'league', 'curriculum', 'education', 'summer', 'week', 'teacher', 'podcasts', 'april', 'daily']"
TG Escapes continue free building design and planning service to keep education projects moving during lockdown. – Education Today,['News'],"April 2, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/tg-escapes-continue-free-building-design-and-planning-service-to-keep-education-projects-moving-during-lockdown/,"Due to the lockdown, most educational construction projects are on hold and will resume on a delayed timetable. If you have a future project in mind, we can help you now with free design and planning to help reduce delays to your build.
In these uncertain times, we are all finding it difficult to know what comes next. One thing we do know is that schools will continue to educate our children and they will need the space in which to do so. Our bespoke design modular buildings provide inspiring additional spaces throughout education.
However, with most construction projects paused, there will be delays caused by problems in the supply chain, duty of care to construction workers, as well as operational issues in schools taking care of the children of key workers. The backlog created means that when we begin to return to normality the resurgence in demand placed on the construction industry will likely exceed its capacity. Planning departments are already stretched and this will get worse during the lockdown and is likely to continue long after.
Here at TG Escapes we continue to work with our customers to deliver designs and submit them to planning. If you have projects that you want to progress we are here to help. We will continue to provide a free design service and, for projects where TG Escapes are the selected partner, we will be happy to manage the planning process for you now at no cost to you (except for the relatively small planning application fee). In this way, we can ensure that projects are at the front of the planning queue as they struggle to cope.
We offer an all-inclusive turnkey service. Our offsite modular construction process means that a bespoke design building can be completed on-site in as little as 6 weeks. We have provided over 700 buildings countrywide and in education, they are used for classrooms, canteens, sports facilities, training centres, early years spaces, SEND facilities and more.
We can provide our free building design without the need to visit your site using photographs, OS mapping and video conferencing. If we can help with your project please don’t hesitate to get in touch by emailing info@tgescapes.co.uk.

Free safeguarding software launched in response to school closures – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'News', 'Safeguarding']","April 1, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/free-safeguarding-software-launched-in-response-to-school-closures/,"School safeguarding provider Impero has launched Impero Back:drop, a free digital safeguarding tool, designed to simplify the recording and management of pupil wellbeing.
The cloud-based system enables remote safeguarding, ensuring that reporting, access and analysis can continue as schools across the UK close in response to COVID-19. The software has a market value of £600/year for a secondary school, and £350/year for a primary school, but it is being offered free of charge in a bid to transform the student safeguarding space moving forwards.
Impero Back:drop enables teachers and safeguarding staff to access a history for each student, including pastoral, child protection, behavioural concerns, or mental health needs, as well as first aid incidents, medical requirements and a log of medicine administration. The system highlights patterns and connects external agencies for a single comprehensive view that enables early interventions and can flag warning signs of serious concerns including suspected home abuse or suicide risk.
Impero has created options within the software to support reporting specifically related to the current outbreak of COVID-19. This update will allow schools to see at a glance whether a student has suspected symptoms, and to track the health of the student body as a whole.
Justin Reilly, former teacher and CEO of Impero says: “Across the country, more than half of schools are still using paper-based filing cabinet reporting systems. Having spent most of my career as a teacher or school advisor, I know how difficult and time-consuming these systems make it to access records, identify trends over time and intervene where necessary. For schools which rely on paper-based systems, in situations where they have to work remotely – as is now the case with COVID-19 – carrying out this activity becomes impossible. Safeguarding must not stop, just because of the pandemic.”
“Schools must be able to access records in cases where remote working is necessary”, continues Reilly. “The idea is to make the reporting of safeguarding concerns for schools across the UK as easy as possible. It’s not right that budget constraints mean some schools have inferior processes in place when it comes to student safeguarding. That is why we are launching this self-sign up system, completely free of charge for schools today, tomorrow and indefinitely.”
While schools remain closed the remote capabilities of the software will ensure that pupil records are kept up to date. Teachers carrying out safeguarding processes, such as home visits to children with child protection concerns can maintain reports in real-time so that no information gaps exist when schools return to normal.
Impero Back:drop is designed to be straightforward to use and quick to implement, so that schools can begin reporting almost immediately. The onboarding process is simple: schools create an account, and then import student and staff data using a CSV file. Depending on the amount of data being uploaded, most schools can be ready to go within half an hour.
The software is managed using an intuitive web interface, and Impero is also making knowledge base articles available on their customer portal so that teachers and safeguarding teams can quickly get to grips with the software.
Impero Back:drop is available for free and schools can sign-up from today on the Impero website.",school safeguarding provider impero ha launched impero backdrop a free digital safeguarding tool designed to simplify the recording and management of pupil wellbeing the cloudbased system enables remote safeguarding ensuring that reporting access and analysis can continue a school across the uk close in response to covid the software ha a market value of year for a secondary school and year for a primary school but it is being offered free of charge in a bid to transform the student safeguarding space moving forward impero backdrop enables teacher and safeguarding staff to access a history for each student including pastoral child protection behavioural concern or mental health need a well a first aid incident medical requirement and a log of medicine administration the system highlight pattern and connects external agency for a single comprehensive view that enables early intervention and can flag warning sign of serious concern including suspected home abuse or suicide risk impero ha created option within the software to support reporting specifically related to the current outbreak of covid this update will allow school to see at a glance whether a student ha suspected symptom and to track the health of the student body a a whole justin reilly former teacher and ceo of impero say across the country more than half of school are still using paperbased filing cabinet reporting system having spent most of my career a a teacher or school advisor i know how difficult and timeconsuming these system make it to access record identify trend over time and intervene where necessary for school which rely on paperbased system in situation where they have to work remotely a is now the case with covid carrying out this activity becomes impossible safeguarding must not stop just because of the pandemic school must be able to access record in case where remote working is necessary continues reilly the idea is to make the reporting of safeguarding concern for school across the uk a easy a possible it not right that budget constraint mean some school have inferior process in place when it come to student safeguarding that is why we are launching this selfsign up system completely free of charge for school today tomorrow and indefinitely while school remain closed the remote capability of the software will ensure that pupil record are kept up to date teacher carrying out safeguarding process such a home visit to child with child protection concern can maintain report in realtime so that no information gap exist when school return to normal impero backdrop is designed to be straightforward to use and quick to implement so that school can begin reporting almost immediately the onboarding process is simple school create an account and then import student and staff data using a csv file depending on the amount of data being uploaded most school can be ready to go within half an hour the software is managed using an intuitive web interface and impero is also making knowledge base article available on their customer portal so that teacher and safeguarding team can quickly get to grip with the software impero backdrop is available for free and school can signup from today on the impero website,"['web', 'wellbeing', 'cloudbased', 'software', 'uploaded', 'medicine', 'student', 'ceo', 'website', 'teacher']"
Things you didn’t know about Laminate flooring – Education Today,"['Buildings & Maintenance', 'News']","March 31, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/things-you-didnt-know-about-laminate-flooring/,"Laminate flooring is required for households as it offers a comforting surface without compromising the looks. It is an affordable and durable flooring option among homeowners. Laminate flooring is favorable as it offers the DIY application and under the feet, it is a luxury. There are various details of laminate flooring that many do not know. A few interesting facts about Laminate flooring are:
Installed on any floor
A versatile choice is laminate flooring. It may be installed on any flooring top. This is the reason it is referred to as a floating floor. There is no need to remove the existing floor to install laminate flooring, while the main prerequisite is to have a flat and clean existing floor. Laminate has a resin coating that the external layer is tough, durable, and scratch-resistant.
Different from Parquet
People are confused between laminate flooring and parquet. They are different. Laminate is a result of fusing multiple synthetic layers using the lamination process. The fiberboard is of high-density but it replicates the wood floors look owing to a photographic layer. Meanwhile, Parquet is done by fixing real hardwood pieces together in a geometric pattern to offer a decorative effect.
Easy to remove or install
Laminate flooring is easy to install like LEGO assembling. There is an interlocking system that allows locking together easily during installation. There is no need for adhesives or nails for the flooring. Likewise, if you have plans to shift to a new house, then laminate flooring may be dismantled and it can be reinstalled in your new house.

Does not hold allergens or mold
A great option for asthma patients and allergy sufferers is the laminate flooring. The flooring on its surface does not hold any allergen or mold. There is no need for any adhesive to install laminate flooring, thereby the indoor air is formaldehyde-free.
The top layer has an image printed
The laminate flooring top layer looks like genuine hardwood, marble or stone flooring. This is a detailed photographic image layer printed using printing technology.  Laminate flooring is cost-effective flooring that is also scratch-resistant featuring interesting qualities. A wonderful soft-feel is felt on installing laminate flooring.
Laminate flooring comes in planks and tanks. It appears in the printed image of high-quality that it reduces noise, costs of heating during winter, and stress on joints and bones. The stain- resistant nature ensures easy maintenance, but spills must be cleaned quickly.

Free safeguarding software and support during national emergency – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'News', 'Safeguarding']","March 26, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/free-safeguarding-software-and-support-during-national-emergency/,"In light of the COVID-19 national emergency and the resulting fact that students are having to work from home, leading safeguarding provider One Team Logic is offering all schools free usage of its MyConcern software.
The unprecedented school closures and social distancing measures in place across the UK, are leading to a significant number of concerns amongst educators about the welfare of pupils and students. Schools, which are a safe haven for many pupils, will now no longer be accessible to all. This will inevitably cause an increase in safeguarding risks that will still need to be managed; in most cases, managed remotely.
Whilst the most vulnerable children (such as those on Child Protection Plans and Looked After Children) will continue to attend school alongside the children of critical workers, there will be a significant number of children who will be at home and who remain at risk of serious harm as a result of abuse, neglect, anxiety, poverty and a whole host of other safeguarding and pastoral issues.
Martin Baker, co-founder and CEO of One Team Logic said, “With the safety and wellbeing of children and young adults at the heart of everything we do, we recognise the incredibly difficult situation that educators face in this uncertain time.
“We are therefore offering access to the MyConcern Safeguarding Software free of charge to all schools that currently don’t have an electronic record keeping system.  We will offer this service free of charge until September 2020 by which time we hope that schools will have resumed ‘normal service’.”
MyConcern will ensure that all staff whether remote or onsite will be able to quickly and easily record safeguarding concerns, and Safeguarding Leads will receive an instant notification of all concerns recorded with full reporting functionality.

EduCare make a number of courses free in response to school closures – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'News', 'Online safety']","March 25, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/educare-make-a-number-of-courses-free-in-response-to-school-closures/,"The impact of Coronavirus is affecting people in many ways. Duty of care and safeguarding training specialists, EduCare, recognise the impact that school closures will have on the safeguarding of children and young people, and have made a number of their courses and resources available for free online.
The courses and resources, which are usually only available to customers, can now be accessed for free via EduCare’s recently launched Coronavirus Hub.
Amongst these resources is information from EduCare’s owner TES, which will support teachers, schools and students during this time. This includes revision material, home packs and self-guided study material.
In addition to the free courses and resources, the Hub also contains the latest news and recommendations for good practice relating to the Coronavirus and children and young people whilst away from education.
Understanding that remote training will be vital to schools over the coming months, EduCare has also made seven online CPD courses available for free. These are:


“Effective Health & Safety for Children with SEND and ASN”


“Parental Responsibility in Schools”


“Search, Screen and Confiscate for Schools”


“Risk Assessments for School Trips”


“Anti-Fraud, Bribery and Corruption”


“Cyber Security”


“Working with Display Screen Equipment”


Also available for free are wellbeing resources from EduCare’s EduSafe resource library. Designed for the community of parents and carers, and children and young people, EduSafe resources have been written with leading experts including Winston’s Wish, Karma Nirvana, YoungMinds, Mentor and The Children’s Society.
EduCare is communicating the message that whilst safeguarding has always been everyone’s responsibility, with school closures this will be more relevant than ever. Schools will soon lose day to day contact with their pupils and so our communities will need to act together to support children and young people.
The intention of the EduSafe resource library is to ensure that the community can access the same level of high-quality information as education staff receive as part of their training.
EduSafe is split into two banks of resources – resources that are specifically designed for parents & carers, and resources that are specifically designed for children & young people.
Topics covered within EduSafe include:


Mental health


Substance misuse


Dealing with bereavement and loss


Honour-based abuse and forced marriage

New ‘Great Exhibition at Home’ challenge launched to inspire young innovators in wake of school shutdown – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'News', 'STEM']","March 24, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-great-exhibition-at-home-challenge-launched-to-inspire-young-innovators-in-wake-of-school-shutdown/,"The Great Exhibition at Home Challenge is a positive contribution to independent learning at home during this period of unprecedented Covid-19 disruption from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, the Royal Academy of Engineering and Big Ideas.
Meaningful, structured and creative STEM activities build to an exhibition to be held in bedrooms, kitchens, shoeboxes, gardens across the country. Inspired by the original Great Exhibition of 1851, The Great Exhibition at Home Challenge asks young people to explore how engineers can help protect the planet. Weekly activities, digital resources and a fantastic video challenge for participants. The Challenge is suitable for home-working or classroom, for primary or secondary ages, and can be completed alone or with friends. The challenge can be started at any time, but will be especially suited to providing an instructive, inspiring and fun activity during the summer term.
The Great Exhibition of 1851 was an international celebration of innovation. To Prince Albert and his team of commissioners it was the ultimate demonstration of a modern world – fast moving and dynamic.
The Great Exhibition at Home Challenge is inspired by the wonder of such a momentous undertaking and the ambition of those involved. It provides an opportunity to connect schools and communities today in the spirit of the Exhibition of 1851, to look to the future and engineer a better world.
The Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 has partnered with The Royal Academy of Engineering to deliver the Great Exhibition at Home with Big Ideas. Students throughout the UK are invited to take part in a seven-week project, culminating in a video challenge. This final challenge asks students to create and share a Great Exhibition, wherever their classroom may be. Free resources are available and winning participants will receive £500 worth of equipment to supersize STEM subjects in their school, as well as other prizes to be announced soon!
Nigel Williams, Secretary of The Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 says, “The Great Exhibition at Home Challenge is very much in the spirit of Prince Albert’s legacy. He would urge us to tackle the immediate challenges we face with the pandemic, but not to lose sight of the long-term goals. Prince Albert was a master of innovation and sought to promote it all his life, reminding us of the need to support and develop our young people and to nurture their curiosity. I am looking forward to seeing what young people today make of Albert’s story and the ways in which it will inspire them to create new inventions for 2020 and beyond.”
Dr Hayaatun Sillem CBE, CEO of the Royal Academy of Engineering, says “Young people are natural engineers – creative, problem solving, adaptable. This is an amazing opportunity for them to think about how they might use engineering to help protect the planet and showcase their ideas, in the style of the famous Great Exhibition of 1851. We will be encouraging students to take part through our Connecting STEM Teachers network and look forward to seeing future engineers step up to this important challenge. As our This is Engineering campaign shows, engineering is a great career for anyone who wants to make a difference and shape the future.”
Dr Virginia Crompton, CEO of Big Ideas says, “Our everyday lives may have changed beyond recognition, but that’s all the more reason to offer engaging and meaningful content for young people, especially as schools are closing. The idea of a Great Exhibition is a brilliantly simple and immediate way to get us all involved and inspired. It really doesn’t matter if the setting is a classroom or a cupboard! We are looking forward to supporting students across the country to take part in this exciting and creative challenge and are honoured to be working with our partners at The Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 and the Royal Academy of Engineering to provide this flexible and engaging home-friendly challenge.”

Carol Vorderman offers online maths tutoring site to all children (aged 4-12) for free following UK schools closures – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'Maths', 'News', 'Primary schools']","March 23, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/carol-vorderman-offers-online-maths-tutoring-site-to-all-children-aged-4-12-for-free-following-uk-schools-closures/,"Following the Government’s decision to close UK schools to minimise the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19), Carol Vorderman and the world’s learning company Pearson, have announced that their online maths tutoring programme, The Maths Factor, will be made available for free from today (Monday 23 March 2020) to support childrens’ continued learning at home for the duration of the UK schools closure period.
The Maths Factor, which was created by educationalist and TV’s most popular mathematical mind Carol Vorderman in 2010, aims to build both children and parents’ maths confidence through short video tutorials, interactive games, revision clubs, tips and challenges.
The online tutoring programme, which forms a key part of Pearson’s suites of maths resources, is available for parents and carers to access online via www.themathsfactor.com  and to teachers through Active Learn Primary, the most widely used classroom management system in UK primary schools. By using The Maths Factor, which is usually a paid-for subscription, children can advance nearly two and a half years in just one year by undertaking four 15 minute sessions a week.
Launching the initiative, Carol Vorderman, said: “As we enter what may be a  stressful and unsettled time for many, it’s so important that we keep a level of normality in place for our children. Yes schools are closed, but learning will go on!
“We cannot expect parents and carers to take on their children’s education alone and we must also ensure teachers are fully supported to provide the best provision for their students during this period of at-home learning, which is why we are making our online maths tutorial site free to all children and families in the UK and beyond.
“We do not want any child to fall behind nor any parent or carer to feel out of their depth. As the nation comes together to navigate this difficult time, we are determined to support families and schools to continue their learning and exploration at home – unlocking children’s confidence and making maths fun. The power of maths – and its impact on children’s outcomes, on science and the world around us –  has never been more clear than it is today.”
Sharon Hague, Senior Vice President of Schools at Pearson, said: “At Pearson, we understand that COVID-19 is directly impacting schools, colleges and learners across the UK. Our thoughts are with all those affected.
“We are committed to ensuring that learning can continue and are working to ensure that children have access to the same Pearson resources at home as they would at school. In partnership with Carol Vorderman, we are pleased to be able to offer The Maths Factor for free whilst schools are closed, alongside providing online versions of wider ActiveLearn resources to parents and carers.
“By drawing on our online learning expertise, we can offer support and continuity to our learners, empower teachers, parents and carers to support children’s learning and ultimately help to minimise the interruption during this period of uncertainty.”

Against a backdrop of a $1bn market increase in STEM toys from 2019-2023, MEL Science has seen a tenfold increase in demand for its home science kits in the past two weeks alone.
MEL Science, an established expert in the development of hands-on science kits for home use, has launched MEL Academy, a series of webinars delivered by science teachers giving online science lessons and hands-on demonstrations for students aged 5-16 years.
With students now learning from home, potentially for several months, this is ideal for science teachers and parents, keen to provide remote learning resources aligned to curriculum standards.
For the next three months, the compelling webinars will cover the core curriculum science learning objectives, through hands-on practicals, theory, and digital resources.  MEL Science’s virtual reality app with award winning science simulations will also be free, enabling students to build and play with science at a micro level.
“Doing hands-on science is magical for kids; it sparks their curiosity, their eyes light up and their confidence builds.  It’s hard to set up practical experiments at home, which is why MEL Academy has been designed to bring scientists into your kitchen to do these experiments with you, and answer questions in real time,” said, Vassili Philippov, CEO of MEL Science.
The experiments can easily be carried out in a kitchen with basic ingredients. For those wanting a higher level of learning, the MEL Science subscription kit offers additional experiments that can be carried out during the webinar.

FutureLearn launches free online courses to support educators affected by COVID-19 – Education Today,"['Coronavirus', 'Digital learning', 'News']","March 20, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/futurelearn-launches-free-online-courses-to-support-educators-affected-by-covid-19/,"FutureLearn, the leading social learning platform, is launching a free online course called ‘How to Teach Online: Providing Continuity for Students’, designed to support educators currently faced with the imminent move to online teaching as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
With the continuation of the coronavirus pandemic, many schools and universities around the world are either already closed or will potentially close soon. FutureLearn recognises that many teachers will not have had prior experience with teaching online and, in response to this, has created its first ever branded course to help provide educators with practical steps to deliver learning and student support online.
‘How to Teach Online: Providing Continuity for Students’ will be led by FutureLearn’s Learning Team, whose role is to develop the learner experience across the platform, informing its development, the learning design of courses, and gathering new insight into how people learn online.
The course will also include contributions from some of FutureLearn’s partnership of prestigious higher education institutions and teaching organisations; the British Council, Chartered College of Teaching, Girls Day School Trust, Dublin City University, University of Exeter Business School, SOAS University of London, University of Manchester, Cardiff University and the University of Sheffield.
Some partners are joining as mentors in the discussions and to answer questions throughout the course. This means learners get access to some of the world’s leading minds in the field of online teaching and learning as well as their excellent resources to help teachers get going online.
During the course, educators will learn how to adapt their practices to an online context and will develop approaches and techniques to engage their students online. The course offers practical and community-driven support and educators will be encouraged to share their best practices to create a sense of community and a wider pool of online teaching approaches that work.
The course is open for enrolment now and will begin on 23rd March. The course is three weeks long and is planned to repeat every three weeks during these unprecedented times.
Simon Nelson, Chief Executive at FutureLearn, commented: “Supporting educators and academics during this unprecedented shift from the classroom to online learning is one of FutureLearn’s biggest priorities at present. Our mission is to transform access to education and, in spite of the disruption that COVID-19 is bringing to schools and universities across the globe, it is incredibly important that students continue to receive a quality education.”
Matt Jenner, lead educator of the course and Learner Experience Lead at FutureLearn, commented: “We know there are a lot of excellent teachers out there who are suddenly finding themselves navigating new and unfamiliar online environments to teach. We support teachers to produce engaging and meaningful online learning experiences and we wanted to help. As a result, we’ve built this course, from scratch, in a week.
“We also wanted to create a community of practice that shares their own challenges, ways of teaching and learner needs – our goal is to connect teachers so they can share, reuse and remix approaches that are simple and effective.

The materials available on the Twinkl website range from activity sheets, information packs and interactive presentations to online educational games and videos. These cover all core subjects for all ages and include a huge range mapped to each curriculum in the UK.
Twinkl is sending out codes to schools, teachers and parents across the world as well as sharing information on social media to provide free access.
The company has already reached out to over 50 countries and regions across the world, including the UK and is continuing to reach out to any not yet contacted.
Teachers, parents and carers in the UK can get access to Twinkl by visiting www.twinkl.co.uk/offer and entering the code CVDTWINKLHELPS alongside an email and password.
Access will initially be granted for one month, but Twinkl is dedicated to extending this.
Anyone with an existing Twinkl subscription using the code will be upgraded to get access to all of Twinkl’s resources if they do not already have this.

Jonathan Seaton, Co-Founder and CEO of Twinkl, said: “After hearing about the necessary precautions that are being taken at schools around the world because of the coronavirus, we recognised that our digital resources could help teachers, parents and children who may be unable to attend school.
“Our mission has and always will be to help those who teach and we know that we need to do this right now more than ever. The things schools, teachers, parents and carers are doing to help their children is incredible and we hope this will go some way towards supporting them. It is also so important to us that children have access to learning, whatever the circumstance, and continue to learn throughout this situation.
“We’ve already had an amazing response, with over 170,000 people using the code so far. We’re so proud to see how this offer of help has already impacted so many.

The internet-based phone system can be live in a matter of minutes, following completion of a short online form, with no card or payment details required. It supports calling, call menus and greetings, voicemail transcription and a range of other features.

CircleLoop operates as a self-service tool and it works anywhere over the internet in desktop and mobile applications instead of using traditional desk-phones. As such, organisations required to self-isolate, but which may not have existing structures in place to facilitate remote working, can use CircleLoop to maintain connectivity and accessibility for their workforce, with immediate notice.
Damian Hanson, co-founder of CircleLoop, commented: “Here at CircleLoop we recognise the unprecedented issues that the Coronavirus outbreak is causing for businesses of all shapes and sizes.

The Benefits of Continuing in Medical Education – Education Today,['News'],"February 26, 2020",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-benefits-of-continuing-in-medical-education/,"Are you a registered nurse who is feeling the need to climb up the medical ladder? If so, you should consider continuing your medical education by becoming a nurse practitioner. Did you know that there are nearly 3 million registered nurses in the U.S, compared to only 1.1 million doctors? With the need for medical care growing at an alarming rate, an opportunity has arised for registered nurses; a chance to continue their education and become a nurse practitioner. In areas such as pediatrics, family medicine, and more, becoming a nurse practitioner is as attractive as it is accomplishable.
Why the Need for Nurse Practitioners?
With the end of the “Baby Boomers” looming, and young-new families growing, there is a need for reliable healthcare but at an affordable price. Nurse practitioners are able to perform a vast majority of procedures that doctors can, but at a lower cost to the patient. This high-level care, at a reasonable cost, is beneficial to those either without insurance or little to no medical benefits at all. A perfect example of the need for nurse practitioners in the medical field, is in adult-geratric medicine. Both the public and medical demand for nurse practitioners is hard to ignore. In fact, over the past few years, primary care and urgent care facilities have seen an increase in hiring nurse practitioners. The upsides to being a nurse practitioner are three fold: the public demand, the medical need, and the fiscal benefits.
The Financial Gain 
The average salary for a nurse practitioner is $110,030, which is far greater than the average salary of a registered nurse being around $65,000 (for individual state averages click here). However, some might be worried about the cost involved in continuing their education against the job availability post-graduation. The good news is this, with schools like Regis College,  becoming a nurse practitioner is more affordable than ever. By applying for your post-masters certificates at Regis, you will be well on your way to building your nursing career.  With there being an estimated  job increase of nearly 30%, over the next 8 years, now is the perfect time to consider continuing your medical education and becoming a nurse practitioner. The financial gain of furthering your medical career is enticing; and being able to help others in the process makes becoming a nurse practitioner even more desirable.
Is this the Right Fit for Me?
Being a registered nurse is rewarding, challenging, and admirable. Choosing to take care of the needs of others is what sets those in the medical field apart from the rest of the world. There will always be a demand for careers in the medical field, and there are many great jobs to choose from.

Make sure your school governors meet their statutory responsibilities – Education Today,['News'],"November 1, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/make-sure-your-school-governors-meet-their-statutory-responsibilities/,"Governance is becoming more complex, requiring greater accountability of educational, operational and financial performance, and the management of key risks.
Hackney Learning Trust’s (HLT) governance services team utilise staff with wide-ranging expertise of school leadership and governance. They are a trusted provider in helping governing boards support and challenge the continuous improvement of their schools
They have a fantastic governance training offer, which can be bought as individual courses or as an annual package.  The courses provided will ensure the schools governors are fully prepared to meet their statutory responsibilities. The training courses will also provide governors with support in delivering stronger governance of educational, organisational and financial performance and developing innovative solutions to common challenges that are facing schools.
Why is training for governing boards so important?
We know from experience that strong governance plays a crucial role in supporting and challenging school leaders to develop and sustain the highest quality of education and exceptional outcomes for all our children, particularly those who are most vulnerable and disadvantaged.

Governing schools in an era of political and financial uncertainty is complex. It requires stronger and more assured governance than ever before to address the greater levels of accountability for educational, operational and financial standards, and the management of key risks. Approximately 300,000 people volunteer as school governors. In doing so they share their skills, expertise and time for free. The financial value of strong governance has an estimated value of £40k per school. The social value of this public role is immeasurable.
How do we deliver our programme?
Our Central Governance Training Package includes The Foundations of Strong Governance: 5 Steps, as well as the session covering Effective Governance of Key Themes. All sessions are delivered by an expert in the relevant field, which makes our offering unique.
We works in partnership with experts within Hackney learning Trust as well as external partners and professional bodies including the National Governance Association (NGA) to be able to offer valued guidance and support that ensures effective governance of all types of schools. We host morning and evening sessions to accommodate the working pattern of governors who volunteer their time and skills. You can download a copy of our training programme here.

What do your customers think about your Governance Service?
“Thank you for leading us in our thinking at our Whole Service Day recently.
You spoke with such conviction that you challenged us to look again at our provision and expectations for the achievement of disadvantaged and vulnerable children. You’re encouraging us to look at classroom experiences and provision through the eye of a child was particularly powerful and thought provoking, as was the story of ‘no child left behind’.
We have become even more determined to challenge our expectations for disadvantaged pupils and to work in a more joined-up way across the service to ensure a coherent approach to improving outcomes for all our children”. We look forward to working with you in the future”.
Danielle Cassell, Senior Manager: System Leadership, East Sussex
“Governor Services were amazing with the level of support that I received last year in my first year of Headship, truly above and beyond their remit. As a new Head they supported me in following the correct processes at all board and committee meetings and gave me the confidence to develop stronger governance in order to drive school improvement at Benthal”.
Louise Drew, Headteacher, Benthal Primary School.
“The governors services enable academies to secure clerking support which provide impartial minute taking and advice in governors meetings and pupil discipline committees.  The regular training opportunities help ensure that governors have the knowledge and skills to interrogate data and provide checks and balances that all schools need to continually improve”

Educators and innovators convene at IB Global Conference 2019 for the first time in Middle East – Education Today,['News'],"October 30, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/educators-and-innovators-convene-at-ib-global-conference-2019-for-the-first-time-in-middle-east/,"The International Baccalaureate (IB) hosted its Global Conference for the first time in the Middle East in United Arab Emirates. More than 1,600 teachers and school leaders shared big ideas, exchanged best practices from the classroom and reflected on the roles they play in preparing students for the rapidly changing global economy of the 21st century.
The largest annual gathering of IB educators and innovators in the Africa, Europe and Middle East (AEM) region, the Global Conference provided a launch pad for new initiatives, partnerships and new developments.
Opening the Conference, Her Excellency Jameela AlMuhairi, Minister of State for General Education, gave a welcome address to the audience. Her Excellency stressed the importance of diversity in school curricula in the UAE. Diversity highlights the UAE’s multinational community and the value of tolerance. She affirmed that it is essential that both the public and the private school system must work together to ensure that all students in the UAE are provided with the skills they need to become the best version of themselves and to be the future citizens we aspire them to be.
Announcements at this year’s Conference included the launch of a partnership with Apex2100 and HIVE Learning to create a mobile app dedicated to supporting IB educators, parents and students with comprehensive, yet easily-consumable athletic performance and wellness content.
Delegates also celebrated the 25th anniversary of the IB’s Middle Years Programme (MYP) with the announcement of a student innovators’ grant for MYP students, which will create opportunity for students to build the skills they need to become leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs the world demands today.
The IB Global Conference acts as a platform for the IB to spread its vision for a world with more well-rounded, multi-lingual and open-minded future citizens, who can respond to global, national and local challenges.
Dr Siva Kumari, the IB’s Director General, said: “As new global challenges emerge from an unprecedented pace of change, an IB education, based on the IB learner profile with its distinct set of attributes, is more relevant and necessary than ever to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Under the Conference theme of “Generation IB”, the IB develops the kind of critical thinkers needed for tomorrow.”
Attendees heard from a line-up of high-profile keynote speakers, including Sir Clive Woodward who addressed the conference on the topic of Peak performance: For learners and athletes; Tina Blythe, Director of Learning and Outreach at Harvard Project Zero, who shared strategies for integrating new practices into day-to-day teaching; Rosan Bosch, founder of Rosan Bosch Studio, who discussed the significant impact of design on behaviour in learning spaces; and Michael Furdyk, co-founder & Director of Innovation, TakingITGlobal, who explained his journey to supporting millions of students to understand and act on the world’s greatest challenges.

Upgraded AOF Mist Filters From AirBench – Education Today,['News'],"October 22, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/upgraded-aof-mist-filters-from-airbench/,"AirBench Ltd have announced an upgraded range of AOF Oil Mist Filters. The AOF range is designed for extraction of oil mist and smoke from machining applications. AOF units can be machine-mounted, or supplied with separate stands where required.
AOF is designed to use the wind shear principle for initial separation of mist from airstreams. As the contaminant loading on the fan is very low, typically they do not suffer from loss of impeller balance and so can be serviced in-house at relatively long intervals.
Units are supplied as standard with a high-grade final filter with an estimated life of up to 3600 working hours.
Usually available from stock, and supplied complete with all parts required for mechanical installation, AirBench can solve most mist extraction issues quickly and simply.
AirBench also supply the OMF range of stand-alone coolant mist filters, which are designed for continuous operation and can be configured to provide a central system supporting multiple machine tools.

Empowering the education sector – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News']","October 17, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/empowering-the-education-sector/,"The education sector remains under pressure and faces both new and long-standing challenges. Funding remains tight, inspection frameworks are changing, rates of disadvantage and high needs are increasing, all of which places more work on teachers and school staff.
But there is opportunity too, with more solutions, providers, talent and expertise within the sector than ever before. There is also a new Secretary of State, with a background as a Governor and a TA as a wife, promising extra money and support in the coming months.
To address these challenges and make the most of the opportunities, the Schools & Academies Show returns to Birmingham’s NEC on 13th-14th November, with a renewed focus on the key things that are important to the sector.
Funding and income generation; Wellbeing & mental health, for both learners and teachers; SEND and the Curriculum will be central to the agenda of sessions across the expanded two days.
Supporting staff is more crucial than ever, with the extra burdens on their time and greater demands being made of many. To reflect this, we have several case studies on the subject, as well as bringing the Wellbeing Demo Area to Birmingham. This dedicated area on the exhibition floor will showcase a range of classes, mini-presentations, demonstrations and talks aimed at senior school and education leaders with the purpose of tackling the growing mental health crisis and wider pupil health issues within the education sector. Stonewall, Food for Life, and The Teen Yoga Foundation, among other organisations, will all provide practical, free workshops for staff on things that they can implement day to day.
With policymakers continuing to drive change across the sector, we are proud to host the Government Education Village, returning once more in partnership with the DfE and ESFA, which will include as a new offer for Birmingham, demo sessions running throughout both days. This means that you will be able to explore in detail specific policies and make the most of their expertise and advice, with representatives from Schools Resource Management, Academies Funding, Finance, Educate Against Hate and The Apprenticeship Service.
Sharing best practice and innovation is important to you, as it is to us, so we have arranged case study seminars in the main agenda on topics such as Opportunity Areas, Private/Maintained School Partnerships, EdTech Implementation and many more. Minister for the School System, Lord Agnew, will be delivering a speech to open the Show and a representation of the political opposition with education With policymakers continuing to drive change across the sector, we are proud to host the Government Education Village, returning once more in partnership with the DfE and ESFA, which will include as a new offer for Birmingham, demo sessions running throughout both days.

Panels will debate Ofsted, the future of work, the curriculum, technology in schools and the sad rise of youth violence. We have brought together Public Health England, the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, a former young offender and parents to discuss this life-changing issue.
New this year is the Charity Village. We recognise the huge contribution charities are making and the good work they are conducting within education. This interactive village of key organisations will provide the perfect opportunity for third sector organisations to showcase their work to you and foster collaboration between the two sectors.
As ever, we are solutions-focussed, with expert providers such as Sage’s finance software, CENTURY Tech’s ground-breaking AI-powered tools which can improve student performance by 30% and cut teacher workload by 6 hours per week. For schools struggling with staffing, Randstad and Smile Education will be on hand with their specialised recruitment systems designed to give top class support both inside and outside of the classroom. If your school is looking to expand, look no further than Maun Funding and Arcadis, experts in securing funding and delivering high quality facilities. Classroom resources abound too, with such successes as Mighty Writer: a brand new, innovative and multisensory resource that transforms children’s literacy almost overnight.
Join us for this and more at the Schools & Academies Show Birmingham on 13th-14th November at the NEC.

More Adults & College Students Learning Civics in Election Season – Education Today,"['CPD', 'Exams', 'News', 'Resources']","October 9, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/more-adults-college-students-learning-civics-in-election-season/,"Civics includes the study of the theoretical, political and practical aspects of citizenship, including the rights and duties of each citizen.  While the 2016 Presidential Election in the U.S. was contentious, the outcome was that more people have become engaged in the electoral process, including young adults. Experts forecast high voter turnout in the 2020 election. This being the case, socially engaged voters would do well to learn about civics, in order to develop informed positions when taking part in the upcoming election.
Citizenship 
The US Constitution is meant to enforce the natural rights of all U.S. citizens, regardless of their race, religion, gender, or other characteristics. A first-year political science course would introduce students to these and other concepts. The essential values of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness were first codified into the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and the Bill of Rights expanded on these concepts.
At the federal level, the United States is a Democratic Republic, where citizens elect representatives who make decisions for them. Every citizen is not only free to take part in elections, but it is also in his or her best interest to do so from an informed position. This may be especially true for immigrants who may have come from more authoritarian homelands.
Civics and civic education 
‘Civics’ comes from the French word ‘civique’ which means ‘citizen.’ Essential components of a curriculum in civics include a number of best-practices, often referred to as the Six Proven Practices for Effective Civic Learning framework. These include:

Provide instruction in government, history, law, and democracy
Incorporate discussion of current local, national, and international issues and events in the classroom, particularly those that young people view as important to their lives
Design and implement programs that provide students with opportunities to apply what they learn through performing community service that is linked to the formal curriculum and classroom instruction.
Offer extracurricular activities that provide opportunities for young people to get involved in their schools or communities
Encourage student participation in school governance.
Encourage students’ participation in simulations of democratic processes and procedures.

Whereas some people believe that values, social justice, and democracy are at their best when they are learned actively through experience, it’s commonly believed that schools must be able to encourage ethical behavior and personal responsibility consisting of the freedom of choice and action, and consequently bearing the results of one’s action. Civic education empowers citizens to be well-informed, active and conscious about their rights and duties. Often, the goal of such courses in civics is to empower students to feel responsible for shaping the world around them.
Democracy
Democracy is a political system that is based on participation in group decision-making. The United States is not actually a democracy at the federal level. In the case of the President, representatives are elected in every state, and the Electoral College determines the outcome, rather than the national popular vote. Civic education equips people with the knowledge to understand the basics of the electoral process. People learn how to protect and support this system of governance and its constant implementation.
Civic education is also used to teach people the most important aspects of the US Constitution. Such an education generally begins with the Bill of Rights but may extend into other areas of the Constitution. The Preamble establishes the purpose of the Constitution, with no force in law. Other sections of the Constitution go on to describe the three branches of government: the Legislative branch, the Judicial branch, and the Executive branch.
Rights and duties of US citizens
All citizens should be aware of their civil rights,so as not to be deprived of their freedom. Among these rights are free expression and a right to a prompt, fair trial by jury. Citizens may vote in elections for public officials, to apply for federal employment requiring U.S. citizenship, and to run for elected office.
As well as rights, every citizen has his/her duties. They are commonly also referred to as responsibilities or obligations. Among the most crucial is a duty to support and defend the Constitution, to participate in the voting process, to stay informed of the issues affecting one’s community and to participate in it, and to respect the rights, beliefs, and opinions of others. Moreover, every citizen is obliged to obey federal, state, and local laws, which includes taxation, and serving on a jury when called upon.
The Importance of an Education in Civics and Political Science
Civics knowledge is used to better every citizen’s life. It’s an essential component of political science, which is applicable to practice. Interest in Civics arises as an urge to keep the US a free and prosperous nation. In 2020, there will be a battle of ideas to determine the direction of the United States over the next four years. While politicians call every election “the most important election in history,” it may actually be true this time around.",civics includes the study of the theoretical political and practical aspect

LearnEd SEND Edition free training event – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News', 'SEND', 'Training']","September 25, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/learned-send-edition-free-training-event/,"Continuing its series of highly popular interactive LearnEd Roadshow training events for teachers, the Department for Education (DfE), Havering Education Services (HES), Corbets Tey school and BESA announce a national education technology conference focusing on SEND on Thursday 14 November 2019.
Designed to deliver free access to peer-to-peer guidance and first-hand insights, LearnED SEND edition provides teachers, leadership teams and SENCOs with a platform to share best practice and advice on the best use of technology in the classroom.
Staff at Corbets Tey special school, will be providing real-life classroom demonstrations and sharing their experiences of working with other schools and suppliers to gather expertise and specialist approaches to using technology effectively, to support SEND students. Other agenda items include prominent keynote speakers, suppliers’ hands-on workshops and panel discussions.
The chaired panel discussions will cover ‘using technology to support effective classroom practice for inclusive teaching and learning‘ and ‘the challenges of assessment and target setting‘; a hot topic at the current time due to national changes to assessing children working below National Curriculum expectations.
Susan Cumbers, enterprise and technology lead at Corbets Tey School said: “The day promises to equip teachers with tools to tackle problems they experience in schools. We will be running a demonstration session covering the use of technology in a range of differentiated learning activities. In addition, suppliers will deliver hands-on demonstrations of their products in virtual classrooms throughout the day where delegates can gain a greater understanding of the technology and how it would fit into their own classrooms. Delegates will leave the event with a wealth of tangible evidence and ideas that they can use.”
Dave Smith, senior inspector at HES said: “We’re really excited to have partnered with the DfE and BESA for this event. With a huge amount of technology resources available, it can be hard for teachers to find the most effective tools for teaching and learning, especially in the context of SEND. Therefore, we wanted to provide them with a space in which to share best practice, hear from peers and gain first-hand experience with innovative education technology. We’re really looking forward to welcoming as many teachers as possible.”
Caroline Wright, Director General , at BESA said: “Feedback from previous LearnEd events across the country has been overwhelmingly positive. However, many came back with a request for a similar event with a SEND focus. We have therefore spent the last year working with teachers, SEND experts and HES to build a lively interactive agenda to appeal to education professionals in special schools, as well as mainstream schools and academies.”
The event will be held at CEME Innovation Centre, Rainham, Essex on Thursday 14 November 2019, from 8:30 until 16:15; registration is free of charge at www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/learned-send-edition-tickets-64971860584 or simply go to LearnED.org.uk.

Academy Schools: A Closer Look at Why More Schools are Converting – Education Today,['News'],"August 29, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/academy-schools-a-closer-look-at-why-more-schools-are-converting/,"The Learning and Skills Act 2000 was introduced by former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair to introduce academies in a bid to give schools in deprived inner-city areas a boost. These academies are independent schools which receive their funding directly from the Government as opposed to their local council – this provides these academies with freedom and independence so that they can establish their own approach of providing education to pupils.
Encouraging Conversion to Academies
The 2010 Academies Act in 2010 then gave all schools in England the freedom to choose to become an academy – now over 50% of pupils in the state-funded education system are taught in an academy or free school. So, why are so many schools now becoming academies and what are the benefits to both students and the schools?
Freedom to Innovate
The main benefit is that the school is free to innovate. Although still inspected by Ofsted, an academy has the freedom to set its own rules and spend the funding how it wishes. This means that you often see academies using the latest and best technology, have alternative lengths of school days and term times and devising their own curriculum. Essentially, this hands the power back to the schools who know how to make the best decisions for pupils and their communities.
Types of Academies
There are two main types of academies and it is important to be aware of the difference. A sponsored academy, as the name suggests, will have sponsors who have control of the academy trust (academies run by individual charitable bodies) – these are usually schools which have under-performed and converted improve their performance. A converter academy, meanwhile, is a school which was successful and often had excellent Ofsted grades which has chosen to convert for increased autonomy (these were introduced in 2010 as part of the Academies Act).
Converting
The opinion on academies is mixed with some stating that academies improve twice as fast as state schools while others claim that it is a way of privatising the school system. Again, results are mixed with some academies performing exceptionally well while others have struggled which is a symptom of providing so much freedom. It is certainly a complex area and one which should carefully be considered by any state school. It is a good idea to seek expert legal advice from somewhere like Browne Jacobson on relation to converting to an academy.
There has been a push in recent times for schools to make the switch to academies and it is easy to see why as there can be many benefits. This provides great freedom and flexibility by giving the schools greater control, but this is also a complex area and one which divides opinion so it is an area that any school will need to carefully consider.",the learning and skill act wa introduced by former labour prime minister tony blair to introduce academy in a bid to give school in deprived innercity area a boost these academy are independent school which receive their funding directly from the government a opposed to their local council this provides these academy with freedom and independence so that they can establish their own approach of providing education to pupil encouraging conversion to academy the academy act in then gave all school in england the freedom to choose to become an academy now over of pupil in the statefunded education system are taught in an academy or free school so why are so many school now becoming academy and what are the benefit to both student and the school freedom to innovate the main benefit is that the school is free to innovate although still inspected by ofsted an academy ha the freedom to set it own rule and spend the funding how it wish this mean that you often see academy using the latest and best technology have alternative length of school day and term time and devising their own curriculum essentially this hand the power back to the school who know how to make the best decision for pupil and their community type of academy there are two main type of academy and it is important to be aware of the difference a sponsored academy a the name suggests will have sponsor who have control of the academy trust academy run by individual charitable body these are usually school which have underperformed and converted improve their performance a converter academy meanwhile is a school which wa successful and often had excellent ofsted grade which ha chosen to convert for increased autonomy these were introduced in a part of the academy act converting the opinion on academy is mixed with some stating that academy improve twice a fast a state school while others claim that it is a way of privatising the school system again result are mixed with some academy performing exceptionally well while others have struggled which is a symptom of providing so much freedom it is certainly a complex area and one which should carefully be considered by any state school it is a good idea to seek expert legal advice from somewhere like browne jacobson on relation to converting to an academy there ha been a push in recent time for school to make the switch to academy and it is easy to see why a there can be many benefit this provides great freedom and flexibility by giving the school greater control but this is also a complex area and one which divide opinion so it is an area that any school will need to carefully consider,"['ofsted', 'government', 'learning', 'england', 'student', 'academy', 'charitable', 'education', 'privatising', 'statefunded']"
Tips on How to Help Your Child Improve in Language – Education Today,['News'],"August 12, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/tips-on-how-to-help-your-child-improve-in-language/,"Kids have to reach certain milestones at a given age. You can find charts online that discuss what children can achieve in terms of language. It includes the number of words they can pronounce and the list of words they can understand. Not all kids achieve that milestone at the same time. Some of them are slightly behind, and it’s understandable. They might eventually get to where you want them to be. However, if your child is consistently behind, and the language problems are getting worse by the day, you have to do something about it.
Spend more time with your child
Perhaps, you’re too busy with work and household chores that you don’t realise your child is already experiencing language difficulties. The problem worsens when your child has no one to talk to. You’re not always around. Therefore, if possible, you have to spend more time talking to your child. You could play games, read books or fool around. The goal is that your child can hear you speak and practice the natural use of language.
Check what your child watches online 
If you’re one of those cool parents who are okay with letting your child watch videos on YouTube without checking them, your child could be in trouble. It’s easy to click on any video online, and your child might open inappropriate or unnecessary content. For instance, it’s possible for your child to encounter cartoon videos in a different language. It will confuse your child even more. Some videos also have characters who baby talk, and it doesn’t help improve language learning at all. Try to control the videos your child watches online to avoid confusion and promote learning.
Consult with a speech pathologist
It might be time to get an expert opinion if you think that the remedies you tried aren’t working at all. Experts know how to keep your child up to speed. They will diagnose the problem and look for methods that might work for your child. It might be pricey, but worth the fees when you know it’s the only way for your child to learn better.
Use educational apps 
It’s possible that your child loves to play with a smartphone or tablet and taking it away could cause tension. Instead of depriving your child of the chance to use the phone for fun, you can maximise available technology such as educational apps. With the aid of apps like Kidsmart, your child will learn and enjoy at the same time. Some apps focus only on language learning. They help improve pronunciation and grammar.  Since your kid doesn’t feel like being in a traditional classroom setting, it won’t be difficult to encourage the use of this app.
Don’t freak out that your child doesn’t speak clearly or is yet to catch up with everyone else. It’s never too late. You can look for strategies to promote language learning. Many people have speaking problems until adulthood, but they eventually manage to speak well.",kid have to reach certain milestone at a given age you can find chart online that discus what child can achieve in term of language it includes the number of word they can pronounce and the list of word they can understand not all kid achieve that milestone at the same time some of them are slightly behind and it understandable they might eventually get to where you want them to be however if your child is consistently behind and the language problem are getting worse by the day you have to do something about it spend more time with your child perhaps youre too busy with work and household chore that you dont realise your child is already experiencing language difficulty the problem worsens when your child ha no one to talk to youre not always around therefore if possible you have to spend more time talking to your child you could play game read book or fool around the goal is that your child can hear you speak and practice the natural use of language check what your child watch online if youre one of those cool parent who are okay with letting your child watch video on youtube without checking them your child could be in trouble it easy to click on any video online and your child might open inappropriate or unnecessary content for instance it possible for your child to encounter cartoon video in a different language it will confuse your child even more some video also have character who baby talk and it doesnt help improve language learning at all try to control the video your child watch online to avoid confusion and promote learning consult with a speech pathologist it might be time to get an expert opinion if you think that the remedy you tried arent working at all expert know how to keep your child up to speed they will diagnose the problem and look for method that might work for your child it might be pricey but worth the fee when you know it the only way for your child to learn better use educational apps it possible that your child love to play with a smartphone or tablet and taking it away could cause tension instead of depriving your child of the chance to use the phone for fun you can maximise available technology such a educational apps with the aid of apps like kidsmart your child will learn and enjoy at the same time some apps focus only on language learning they help improve pronunciation and grammar since your kid doesnt feel like being in a traditional classroom setting it wont be difficult to encourage the use of this app dont freak out that your child doesnt speak clearly or is yet to catch up with everyone else it never too late you can look for strategy to promote language learning many people have speaking problem until adulthood but they eventually manage to speak well,"['pricey', 'smartphone', 'diagnose', 'parent', 'working', 'learning', 'busy', 'online', 'pathologist', 'kidsmart']"
Armstrong Ceiling Solutions’ Top 5 tips for specifying education ceilings – Education Today,"['Buildings & Maintenance', 'News']","August 12, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/armstrong-ceiling-solutions-top-5-tips-for-specifying-education-ceilings/,"With the new school year imminent, latest research by public sector procurement specialist Scape Group shows 640 new schools will be needed over the next two years.
To handle the demand, Scape Group is asking for focus on delivering a strategy and solutions which not only provide high-quality, modern spaces for teaching and learning but also offer local authorities cost certainty, value for money and timely delivery.
But buildings for education are among those which have particularly onerous design requirements.
Five top tips for education ceiling design:

Research shows that on any given day, thousands of students are unable to understand 1 out of every 4 spoken words in classrooms due to inadequate acoustics. In addition, teacher surveys consistently rank noisy classrooms and vocal fatigue high on their list of frustrations. TIP: A medium-density ceiling tile, strikes the right balance between both sound attenuation and sound absorption, blocking unwanted noise from outside while enhancing sound quality inside.
Any area in an education setting will have an optimum reverberation time (RT) requirement depending upon its use and size and whether the main activity is speech or music-based. Providing too much sound absorption, and hence having a very low RT, can be just as acoustically damaging and undesirable as having insufficient sound absorption when an excessively long reverberation time will result. An acoustic module available from some manufacturers enables a simple indicative calculation of reverberation time to be made. TIP: The installation of clouds and canopies in a reverberant space such as dining halls, lobbies and school halls, can significantly reduce the reverberation time and contribute to the reduction in background noise.
Fire resistance in a suspended ceiling can only be achieved by a combined tile and grid system as there is no such thing as a fire resistant tile or a fire resistant grid. TIP: Depending upon national legislation, the type of structure to be protected and a manufacturer’s product offer, ceiling systems can provide at least 30 and more than 60 minutes’ protection against fire.
The acoustic treatment of ceilings does not have to come at the expense of other educational “technologies” which are increasingly integrated as more IT and interactive systems are applied to help the teaching and learning of students in multiple ways. TIP: Ceiling systems can offer integrated solutions that incorporate all necessary ceiling fixtures as well as IT appliances, while also providing a seamless monolithic look.
Poor lighting and glare in the classroom can also cause eye strain and fatigue for both staff and students. TIP: A well-designed ceiling with high light reflectance improves the overall illumination and lighting uniformity of the room, directly affecting students’ working comfort and productivity. In addition, high light reflectance ceiling tiles can provide cost savings of up to 20%, equating to as much as an 11% reduction of the energy buildings use.

Students celebrate Middle Years Programme eAssessment results across the world – Education Today,['News'],"August 5, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/students-celebrate-middle-years-programme-eassessment-results-across-the-world/,"Today, more than 77,800 International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Programme (MYP) students from around the world are receiving their eAssessment results from the May 2019 examination session.
This represents an 8% increase compared with last year. 819 schools in 98 countries participated, and students received an average score of 36.54 points (of 56 possible maximum).
Regulated by Ofqual in the UK, the MYP eAssessment (on-screen assessments and ePortfolios) aims to challenge students to think critically and independently while solving real-world problems using a broad range of knowledge. 75% of the assessment focusses on inquiry, communication and critical thinking skills, while the other 25% focuses on knowledge and understanding.  MYP eAssessments utilise media-rich on-screen examinations that enable creative responses, or responses that require students to manipulate data and present new understandings using much more dynamic methods than on paper.
Having only been introduced in 2016, the MYP eAssessment has received several accolades including; Best Use of Summative Assessment at the e-Assessment Awards, Best Assessment Solution award at the ScooNews Global Education Awards and is a finalist for this year’s PIEoneer Awards that are taking place in September.
Paula Wilcock, IB’s Chief Assessment Officer, said: “I want to wish all the students receiving their MYP results my warmest congratulations. We will continue to develop assessments that measure the skills that universities and employers tell us they need to see, and that give our students the best and most relevant assessment experience. Whilst we are proud of the awards we have received, seeing the numbers of students experiencing our eAssessments grow is the greatest accolade we can receive, and I’d like to thank all our examiners who help us to deliver results to growing number of students”.

International Baccalaureate eliminates its student examination registration fee – Education Today,['News'],"July 31, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/international-baccalaureate-eliminates-its-student-examination-registration-fee/,"As part of a focused effort to reduce financial barriers for students and schools to participate in its unique programmes, the International Baccalaureate (IB) has announced that it is eliminating the $172/£138 “candidate registration” fee that students traditionally pay (as a cost separate from individual IB subject exams).
This decision to lower per student assessment costs is intended to help more students worldwide afford additional subject examinations or pursue a full IB Diploma Programme, as well as help more schools join the community of more than 5,000 IB World Schools worldwide.
Dr. Siva Kumari, the IB’s Director General, said: “A key part of our mission is to continue developing our organisation for the international student community who are well-rounded, multilingual and open-minded citizens—a new generation educated in ways that enable them to respond thoughtfully to global, national and local challenges.
“Facing imminent global changes and a new industrial revolution of technology and AI, IB’s focus on preparing the future workforce to be agile learners and critical thinkers is more relevant and necessary than ever.”
Elimination of the registration fee is the latest in a series of decisions by the IB to ease financial burdens to open up access. It recently provided discounts for schools that offer three or more IB programmes and expanded its ongoing investments in professional development for IB educators, offering some of its courses at no charge.
After investing in technology that modernised IB’s assessment systems over the past 10 years, and as a result of careful management of its costs, the IB is able to pass along the financial benefits directly to students and schools, Kumari noted.
Haif Bannayan, the IB’s Director of Outreach and Conferences, said: “We are focused on developing the deep and broad thinkers that the world needs in the 4th industrial revolution. Developing agile and thoughtful learners is fundamental to IB’s educational philosophy and that is why we believe that our world-class model for 21st century workforce development must be more accessible.”",a part of a focused effort to reduce financial barrier for student and school to participate in it unique programme the international baccalaureate ib ha announced that it is eliminating the candidate registration fee that student traditionally pay a a cost separate from individual ib subject exam this decision to lower per student assessment cost is intended to help more student worldwide afford additional subject examination or pursue a full ib diploma programme a well a help more school join the community of more than ib world school worldwide dr siva kumari the ibs director general said a key part of our mission is to continue developing our organisation for the international student community who are wellrounded multilingual and openminded citizens—a new generation educated in way that enable them to respond thoughtfully to global national and local challenge facing imminent global change and a new industrial revolution of technology and ai ibs focus on preparing the future workforce to be agile learner and critical thinker is more relevant and necessary than ever elimination of the registration fee is the latest in a series of decision by the ib to ease financial burden to open up access it recently provided discount for school that offer three or more ib programme and expanded it ongoing investment in professional development for ib educator offering some of it course at no charge after investing in technology that modernised ibs assessment system over the past year and a a result of careful management of it cost the ib is able to pas along the financial benefit directly to student and school kumari noted haif bannayan the ibs director of outreach and conference said we are focused on developing the deep and broad thinker that the world need in the th industrial revolution developing agile and thoughtful learner is fundamental to ibs educational philosophy and that is why we believe that our worldclass model for st century workforce development must be more accessible,"['discount', 'outreach', 'diploma', 'investing', 'educated', 'exam', 'modernised', 'student', 'educator', 'worldclass']"
Power of the Network: Building a Business Through the Network – Education Today,['News'],"July 17, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/power-of-the-network-building-a-business-through-the-network/,"Luke Nolan, CEO and Founder, Student.com
Networking, a basic in business and the number one step to get a business idea off the ground. But actually networking and partnerships is a valuable tool for your business throughout its growth, not just at the start of the journey. Building a business based on a network can be a solid business strategy to take and here’s how you can do it too.
Look Close First
We have heard about the rule of six degrees of separation, where everyone in the world is somehow connected via six contacts, well this is even smaller in business. It’s surprising who you can find mutual connections with on networking platforms such as LinkedIn, or even closer to home with family and friends. Everyone knows somebody, and that somebody may be the key to unlock the next stage of your business journey. You could meet anyone from a potential investor, a valuable freelancer to the latest member of a sales team, however, on the flipside of being only a few introductions away this means that you need to be ready to share your pitch at any moment. Traditionally your go to would be an elevator pitch, in theory short enough to pitch whilst travelling a few floors in a lift, but you can take it that step further by condensing down your business proposition and benefit to just one sentence. It’s easy to get caught up in the detail, especially if you are passionate about your business, however everyone won’t need or be interested in the finer details. Consider how you would explain your business to an eight or eighty year old and you won’t go far wrong.
Look for Experts
It’s well documented from some of the world’s greatest business leaders who have credited part of their success comes from hiring people who can do what they can’t, and that is vital when building your network. Often businesses are looking to venture in new markets when growing. This is a natural step for a business to take but in order to achieve this you need local experts and skills. Whilst you can identify other market potential as a business – whether in Europe or further afield – you won’t have local knowledge. The small, and what may seem insignificant regional nuances can often put a halt to either setting up a base in the region or hiring the right team. This is a recipe for failure and your ventures to new markets will be short lived. Therefore it’s worth looking to build your network based on local experts who can help guide you in those early days to provide longevity as your business grows.
Look for Middle Ground
Once you are building your network think about mutual exchange, and championing them where possible. Often a personal recommendation can go a long way, or perhaps an introductory meeting with a new contact. Considering what you have to offer as a business – whether that’s office co-share space or joint partnerships on projects – to support your network is a big factor. In a world where our online brand is as important, if not in some cases more important than our offline brand – social media and websites are key. Can you conduct a blog exchange with someone in your network that your target audience might find beneficial, or can you share upcoming events to your network which might help expand contacts for all parties involved? Overlooked for more pressing business actions, actually conducting regular social media activities will help nurture your network. In the modern day the age old skill of networking and partnerships certainly hasn’t died out.
We now function in fully connected world – both online and offline. Whether building your local or global network is your focus, the power it holds can help you build a successful business, taking you to the next stage of your growth.",luke nolan ceo and founder networking a basic in business and the number one step to get a business idea off the ground but actually networking and partnership is a valuable tool for your business throughout it growth not just at the start of the journey building a business based on a network can be a solid business strategy to take and here how you can do it too look close first we have heard about the rule of six degree of separation where everyone in the world is somehow connected via six contact well this is even smaller in business it surprising who you can find mutual connection with on networking platform such a linkedin or even closer to home with family and friend everyone know somebody and that somebody may be the key to unlock the next stage of your business journey you could meet anyone from a potential investor a valuable freelancer to the latest member of a sale team however on the flipside of being only a few introduction away this mean that you need to be ready to share your pitch at any moment traditionally your go to would be an elevator pitch in theory short enough to pitch whilst travelling a few floor in a lift but you can take it that step further by condensing down your business proposition and benefit to just one sentence it easy to get caught up in the detail especially if you are passionate about your business however everyone wont need or be interested in the finer detail consider how you would explain your business to an eight or eighty year old and you wont go far wrong look for expert it well documented from some of the world greatest business leader who have credited part of their success come from hiring people who can do what they cant and that is vital when building your network often business are looking to venture in new market when growing this is a natural step for a business to take but in order to achieve this you need local expert and skill whilst you can identify other market potential a a business whether in europe or further afield you wont have local knowledge the small and what may seem insignificant regional nuance can often put a halt to either setting up a base in the region or hiring the right team this is a recipe for failure and your venture to new market will be short lived therefore it worth looking to build your network based on local expert who can help guide you in those early day to provide longevity a your business grows look for middle ground once you are building your network think about mutual exchange and championing them where possible often a personal recommendation can go a long way or perhaps an introductory meeting with a new contact considering what you have to offer a a business whether thats office coshare space or joint partnership on project to support your network is a big factor in a world where our online brand is a important if not in some case more important than our offline brand social medium and website are key can you conduct a blog exchange with someone in your network that your target audience might find beneficial or can you share upcoming event to your network which might help expand contact for all party involved overlooked for more pressing business action actually conducting regular social medium activity will help nurture your network in the modern day the age old skill of networking and partnership certainly hasnt died out we now function in fully connected world both online and offline whether building your local or global network is your focus the power it hold can help you build a successful business taking you to the next stage of your growth,"['elevator', 'championing', 'expert', 'online', 'valuable', 'networking', 'investor', 'party', 'business', 'ceo']"
Pupils full of bright ideas for improving schools – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools']","July 12, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/pupils-full-of-bright-ideas-for-improving-schools/,"Primary school pupils are being given the chance to shape the services offered in schools in North Yorkshire and beyond.
In the first event of its kind, up to 200 year 6 pupils took part in interactive workshops to give a valuable insight and help to develop a variety of services offered by the county council to schools from recruiting teachers, to making school meals more enticing to teaching maths.
The Pupil Innovation Festival was held at Thirsk Racecourse by North Yorkshire Education Services (NYES), which is run by the county council.  Pupils were given the chance to trial the use of artificial intelligence with technology partner Century Tech; give their views to Teesside University on the development of virtual reality games to support maths teaching; trial a ‘waste and wormeries’ lesson with Yorwaste, and work with Matt Leivers, Group Chef Manager with the Michelin-starred Star Inn restaurants, to develop new school meals.
Emma Grunwell, Head of Marketing and Innovation for NYES, said: “We decided to use a completely different approach to develop our services by focusing on the end user. The pupils had an energised, fun-filled day in the process. It’s been great to see such a positive attitude from the students and such great ideas.
“I’m especially keen to see more children making pianos from bananas and getting involved in sampling a meal created by a chef working for a group of restaurants with a Michelin star – not many pupils will get that on their menu every day!”
Pupils also talked to staff about what they love about school and what they believe makes a great teacher to help the county council’s in-house teacher recruitment team.
The festival focused on helping to raise attainment and awareness of pupil’s mental health.  External experts Deputy Mitchell and Chimp Management provided techniques and new ways of working to help pupils to manage their emotions.
County Councillor Patrick Mulligan, North Yorkshire’s Executive Member for Education and Skills, said: “Our pupils had so much fun and were full of wonderful ideas so we are really looking forward to seeing some of these come to life over the next few months. We are hoping to continue to use this valuable pupil insight to develop a range of our services, including school catering, school improvement, energy and sustainability and teacher recruitment.”

The Different Disciplines in Hematology – Education Today,['News'],"July 11, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-different-disciplines-in-hematology/,"Hematology is the branch of pathology or medicine that involves the study of the causes, treatments, prognosis, and prevention of blood-related conditions. Any disease that affects the blood and its components such as hemoglobin, blood proteins, platelets, blood cells, and bone marrow is classified in this category. The diseases can include leukemia, hemophilia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The physicians who specialize in the fields of hematology are called hematologists or hematopathologists. Since hematology is very broad, there is room for more specializing and get into more specific disciplines that include;

Haemato-oncology

Haemato-oncology discipline involves the study and treatment of blood cancers such as acute and chronic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma. These cancers occur because of cell overgrowth, so the physicians focus on how to control blood cells and other blood components from growing out of control. Hematology jobs are available for people who specialize in Haemato-oncology are plenty because blood-related cancers are on the rise.

Hemostasis/thrombosis

Another popular discipline in hematology is hemostasis and thrombosis because they are two sides of the same coin. Hemostasis is basically blood clotting, which is normal and prevents too much blood loss in case of an injury. Thrombosis, on the other hand, is the formation of clots inside the blood vessels, which is the main cause of heart attacks, stroke, and anginas. The physicians who specialize in this area, therefore, study and treat hemostasis and thrombosis disorders, whether congenital or acquired. They can include bleeding disorders like hemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Blood cell production disorders.

Blood cell disorders occur when there is a problem with red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. Red blood cells carry oxygen to different organs, while white blood cells carry nutrients and fight infections. Some of the conditions that come up as a result of blood cell abnormalities include various forms of anemia, thalassemia, hemophilia, Von Willebrand disease, primary thrombocythemia, and blood cancers.

Transfusion medicine

Transfusion is yet another. Many people think that any doctor is allowed to perform a blood transfusion. This is a vast discipline that involves using another person’s blood to treat a patient. Transfusion therapy is an area that requires a lot of knowledge on blood types, blood sources, donor selection, and blood collection. The physicians who are experts in transfusion usually run the blood bank in hospitals and blood donor centers across the world.

Pediatric Hematology

Children have unique medical needs that require specialized care. Pediatric hematology specifically looks at blood disorders in children from birth to teenage. After finishing medical school, the physician has to do pediatric residency and then study pediatric hematology for three additional years. This discipline is one of the most complicated areas; hence the many years of study and hands-on experience because children are very delicate.

What Type Of Study Is Right For You – Education Today,"['News', 'Safety & Security']","June 19, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/what-type-of-study-is-right-for-you/,"What Type Of Study Is Right For You
An education is often cited as the path to success. But what does that mean exactly? Education can come in many different forms, some formal and very high level and others not so much but learning is important for both our professional careers and also our personal well being. Here are a few of the different types of learning we can pursue and what are the advantages of each.
Undergraduate University Degree
An undergraduate university degree is the standard type of degree people are talking about when they refer to a university degree. Study at this level tends to be in academic rather than practical or vocational subjects, meaning that it is more likely you will be learning theory, writing essays and conducting research projects or experiments in a science degree. Some types of degree are a precursor to further study to then obtain a professional qualification in areas such as law or medicine and other degrees actually qualify you for a certain job straight away such as nursing or teaching and others will give you a good degree that shows you are a dedicated individual that can achieve something.
Post-Graduate University Degree
If you want to study further at university then a postgraduate degree is just that, one undertaken after graduating from an undergraduate course. These are generally divided into a one year Masters degree or a PhD doctorate, which is a research degree where you are adding a useful contribution to the academic world and will be able to use the title of Doctor on completion.
College
Traditionally college may have been thought of as a lesser form of learning than university but it’s really just study with a different aim and outcome. You are more often studying a vocational qualification, one that prepares you for an area of work, such as trades, IT skills and much more. You can do full degrees or one year HNC courses or two year HNDs right down to more entry level NVQs wand you might say, what does NVQ Stand for? It’s a National Vocational Qualification which can give you practical skill in a variety of useful work areas. Also if you are looking to progress in education you can go all the way from NVQ level through a university access course and could go all the way from having no qualifications right up to the highest level of academia.
On The Job Training
Learning does not necessarily mean going to college or university there are plenty of examples of on the job training and learning in a variety of workplaces. Most employers will keep a record of training or professional development ranging from basic health and safety courses to learning new skills and management training schemes. You should also ask if any of your employers training schemes earn you a recognised qualification or certificate and, if so, get and keep a copy of that. You can also complete a more formal apprenticeship within many industries these days and this often involves a certain amount of time at college paid for by your employer.",what type of study is right for you an education is often cited a the path to success but what doe that mean exactly education can come in many different form some formal and very high level and others not so much but learning is important for both our professional career and also our personal well being here are a few of the different type of learning we can pursue and what are the advantage of each undergraduate university degree an undergraduate university degree is the standard type of degree people are talking about when they refer to a university degree study at this level tends to be in academic rather than practical or vocational subject meaning that it is more likely you will be learning theory writing essay and conducting research project or experiment in a science degree some type of degree are a precursor to further study to then obtain a professional qualification in area such a law or medicine and other degree actually qualify you for a certain job straight away such a nursing or teaching and others will give you a good degree that show you are a dedicated individual that can achieve something postgraduate university degree if you want to study further at university then a postgraduate degree is just that one undertaken after graduating from an undergraduate course these are generally divided into a one year master degree or a phd doctorate which is a research degree where you are adding a useful contribution to the academic world and will be able to use the title of doctor on completion college traditionally college may have been thought of a a lesser form of learning than university but it really just study with a different aim and outcome you are more often studying a vocational qualification one that prepares you for an area of work such a trade it skill and much more you can do full degree or one year hnc course or two year hnd right down to more entry level nvqs wand you might say what doe nvq stand for it a national vocational qualification which can give you practical skill in a variety of useful work area also if you are looking to progress in education you can go all the way from nvq level through a university access course and could go all the way from having no qualification right up to the highest level of academia on the job training learning doe not necessarily mean going to college or university there are plenty of example of on the job training and learning in a variety of workplace most employer will keep a record of training or professional development ranging from basic health and safety course to learning new skill and management training scheme you should also ask if any of your employer training scheme earn you a recognised qualification or certificate and if so get and keep a copy of that you can also complete a more formal apprenticeship within many industry these day and this often involves a certain amount of time at college paid for by your employer,"['science', 'teaching', 'academia', 'education', 'professional', 'medicine', 'university', 'undergraduate', 'doctorate', 'academic']"
"15,000 free books to be given away to UK schools to get children excited about space – Education Today","['KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Science', 'Space!', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","June 13, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/15000-free-books-to-be-given-away-to-uk-schools-to-get-children-excited-about-space/,"An exciting new school project will encourage thousands of British students to realise their inner space expert and explore the Universe, thanks to teaching resources including 15,000 free books. To celebrate the UK’s involvement with one of the most globally-anticipated space missions, the James Webb Space Telescope, the Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC) today launch a new primary education programme, in partnership with the publisher Curved House Kids.
The Deep Space Diary programme introduces KS2/P5-7 students to astronomy, physics, engineering and space through the story of the James Webb Space Telescope. With the support of the STFC, 15,000 free books will be available to schools across the UK with priority given to those in disadvantaged areas or with high numbers of pupil premium.
The Deep Space Diary is the third book in the series, with the previous two created with the UK Space Agency, author Lucy Hawking and inspired by European Space Agency (ESA) Astronaut Tim Peake’s 2015 Principia mission.
Tim Peake says:  “In 2015 we created the Principia Space Diary to empower younger students to learn about space and science while they followed my mission to the International Space Station. That book, and the subsequent Mars Diary sequel, were a huge success as they tackle a range of challenging subjects in a creative and hands-on way. I’m excited to see the ideas and innovations our young British space experts come up with as they complete this new Deep Space Diary and explore the biggest questions about our Universe.”
The James Webb Space Telescope (or simply Webb), due to launch in 2021, is the largest space telescope ever built (the size of a tennis court when deployed) and is expected to reveal even more about the Universe than its predecessor, Hubble. Webb is a global project, led by NASA, with some of its key experts in Europe and the UK. The Deep Space Diary makes this incredible human achievement accessible for younger students by delivering complex ideas in creative, student-led ways. The diary was also developed with and features a diverse group of real engineers and astronomers who have worked on Webb or will use it to explore the Universe.
European Principle Investigator for MIRI Professor Gillian Wright said: “Celebrating the involvement that the UK has in this revolutionary mission, whilst at the same time giving children an insight in to how exciting being involved in a space science mission can be makes this a very special project; after all they will be the scientists and engineers of the future.”
From today (Thursday 13th June) primary schools in the UK are invited to register at discoverydiaries.org for a chance to receive a free box of 30 Deep Space Diaries plus stickers and a Mission Log poster for their class. Books will be allocated to schools on a first come, first served basis with priority given to those in disadvantaged areas or with a higher percentage of free school meals. Other schools, home educating families and community groups can also register to access the free online programme, or purchase printed diaries via the online bookshop. Books will be delivered in September 2019, at the beginning of the new school year.
Teachers are fully supported with an online portal containing over 60 hours of classroom and home learning activities, differentiated teaching notes, curriculum guides (for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland), extension activities, multimedia resources and more. The programme also provides cross-curricular links, combining STEM learning with a breadth of other subjects to ensure that every child can find a way in to science and engineering. Publisher Kristen Harrison says: “Our goal with the Discovery Diaries is not necessarily to hot-house future STEM experts (though that’s a happy bi-product!) but to encourage every child, regardless of their skills, interests or circumstances, to imagine, create, question, research, visualise, analyse, problem solve and generally “think like a scientist”. These are skills that will help them throughout their lives and the James Webb Space Telescope is the perfect inspiration for all of that.”
The Deep Space Diary has been developed by Curved House Kids with Dr Olivia Johnson at STFC’s UK Astronomy Technology Centre and Royal Observatory Edinburgh. A skilled team of practising primary teachers have co-written teaching materials and curriculum guides and Professor Peter McOwan at Queen Mary University of London has provided academic advice and feedback on activities.",an exciting new school project will encourage thousand of british student to realise their inner space expert and explore the universe thanks to teaching resource including free book to celebrate the uk involvement with one of the most globallyanticipated space mission the james webb space telescope the science and technology facility council stfc today launch a new primary education programme in partnership with the publisher curved house kid the deep space diary programme introduces ksp student to astronomy physic engineering and space through the story of the james webb space telescope with the support of the stfc free book will be available to school across the uk with priority given to those in disadvantaged area or with high number of pupil premium the deep space diary is the third book in the series with the previous two created with the uk space agency author lucy hawking and inspired by european space agency esa astronaut tim peakes principia mission tim peake say in we created the principia space diary to empower younger student to learn about space and science while they followed my mission to the international space station that book and the subsequent mar diary sequel were a huge success a they tackle a range of challenging subject in a creative and handson way im excited to see the idea and innovation our young british space expert come up with a they complete this new deep space diary and explore the biggest question about our universe the james webb space telescope or simply webb due to launch in is the largest space telescope ever built the size of a tennis court when deployed and is expected to reveal even more about the universe than it predecessor hubble webb is a global project led by nasa with some of it key expert in europe and the uk the deep space diary make this incredible human achievement accessible for younger student by delivering complex idea in creative studentled way the diary wa also developed with and feature a diverse group of real engineer and astronomer who have worked on webb or will use it to explore the universe european principle investigator for miri professor gillian wright said celebrating the involvement that the uk ha in this revolutionary mission whilst at the same time giving child an insight in to how exciting being involved in a space science mission can be make this a very special project after all they will be the scientist and engineer of the future from today thursday th june primary school in the uk are invited to register at for a chance to receive a free box of deep space diary plus sticker and a mission log poster for their class book will be allocated to school on a first come first served basis with priority given to those in disadvantaged area or with a higher percentage of free school meal other school home educating family and community group can also register to access the free online programme or purchase printed diary via the online bookshop book will be delivered in september at the beginning of the new school year teacher are fully supported with an online portal containing over hour of classroom and home learning activity differentiated teaching note curriculum guide for england wale scotland and northern ireland extension activity multimedia resource and more the programme also provides crosscurricular link combining stem learning with a breadth of other subject to ensure that every child can find a way in to science and engineering publisher kristen harrison say our goal with the discovery diary is not necessarily to hothouse future stem expert though thats a happy biproduct but to encourage every child regardless of their skill interest or circumstance to imagine create question research visualise analyse problem solve and generally think like a scientist these are skill that will help them throughout their life and the james webb space telescope is the perfect inspiration for all of that the deep space diary ha been developed by curved house kid with dr olivia johnson at stfcs uk astronomy technology centre and royal observatory edinburgh a skilled team of practising primary teacher have cowritten teaching material and curriculum guide and professor peter mcowan at queen mary university of london ha provided academic advice and feedback on activity,"['bookshop', 'classroom', 'celebrating', 'globallyanticipated', 'science', 'scientist', 'astronomy', 'june', 'nasa', 'astronaut']"

Institute of Physics launches the UK and Ireland’s largest source of free education resources for those teaching physics – Education Today,"['Features', 'News', 'Resources', 'Teaching resources']","June 7, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/institute-of-physics-launches-the-uk-and-irelands-largest-source-of-free-education-resources-for-those-teaching-physics/,"The Institute of Physics (IOP) today has launched a comprehensive new online education destination for every aspect of teaching pre-19 physics.
The new www.iop.org/spark website will provide a ‘go to’ resource enabling anyone involved in teaching physics to discover over 2000 free, inter-lined IOP education resources including lesson plans, experiment ideas, teacher notes and student worksheets.
All resources on the site are quality assured having been IOP approved and tried and tested by physics teachers. The resources have been made quick and simple to find with content themed by curriculum area and searchable by student age, physics topic or by type of activity.
The site, which has been years in the making, will also feature CPD content, themed research, news and videos to bring classroom teaching to life and an innovative area dedicated to enabling teachers to identify and challenge common student misconceptions.
Charles Tracy, Head of Education at the Institute of Physics commented: ‘Our hope is that the new IOPSpark site will provide teachers with a trusted source of ideas and professional learning, whether they are looking for a quick fix or pedagogical contemplation. Some of the site’s resources are ready to use whilst others will allow users to delve a bit deeper and explore the best ways to present those ideas and develop their own explanations.
‘By providing teachers with high quality resources, open access to the latest subject thinking and by empowering collaboration amongst the physics teaching community we hope to help create the optimum conditions in which this fascinating subject can flourish in schools for generations to come.’
The new IOPSpark site is just one of many initiatives being undertaken by the Institute of Physics to help physics as a subject thrive in schools.
The IOP recently launched a new Department for Education funded initiative to increase the proportion of girls taking physics at A-level. The Improving Gender Balance research trial involves hundreds of schools across England in undertaking an intensive programme of positive intervention aimed at significantly increasing the number of girls progressing to A-level physics. Currently only one fifth of A-level physics students are girls.
The new IOPSpark website www.iop.org/spark is not only designed for dedicated physics teachers. It is also designed to be a useful resource for technicians, for those training physics teachers, for recent graduate teachers and for other teachers given the responsibility of teaching physics.
As a result the site includes CPD resources, articles on developing professional skills and a constantly updated glossary of physics terms. Many of the free teaching resources also feature useful teaching tips.

SIMS Power BI Reporting – Revolutionise the way your school views data – Education Today,['News'],"June 4, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/sims-power-bi-reporting-revolutionise-the-way-your-school-views-data/,"The SIMS team at Hackney Learning Trust are excited to introduce SIMS Power BI Reporting, the new integration between Microsoft’s Power BI (Business Intelligence) tool and SIMS, set to revolutionise the way that schools view data.
A school’s SIMS system is the hub of all the important information that leaders and class teachers need to make informed decisions. However, up until now it’s been difficult for schools to extract and analyse their schools’ data in a simple way.
The integration of Power BI and SIMS is set to change all that, and the HLT SIMS team are preparing to support the new ‘SIMS Consolidated Reporting’ tool when it launches in September 2019.
On its own, Power BI is a powerful analysis tool traditionally used to create graphs and visualisations that can be used to analyse data more effectively. Combining this analytical capability with data held in a school’s SIMS system will enable senior leaders and teachers to understand their schools’ data in a way that just wasn’t possible before.
With new insights into areas including behaviour management, attendance and SEND, data will be presented in a much simpler format to allow deeper understanding and more informed evaluations.
Cristina de Pointis, MIS Support Manager at HLT, commented on the new product:
“Our team are really enjoying being able to create detailed SIMS reports using Power BI with data extracted from SIMS to build central dashboards, enabling schools and MATS to monitor and compare performance. Schools need this insight to make the right decisions to improve standards, and the SIMS consolidated reports using Power BI can do just that.”
SIMS Power BI reporting is a great addition to the already robust selection of SIMS support services that the HLT SIMS accredited team have to offer. The team currently work with 60 schools offering a wide range of services including comprehensive support, unlimited helpdesk support, bespoke training, workshops, access to the MIS website, and more.
If you’d like to benefit from this exciting new development or to learn more about any of our other SIMS services, our specialist team would love to speak to you.

BBC Bitesize launches new campaign to support pupils preparing for secondary school – Education Today,"['News', 'Secondary schools', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","May 20, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/bbc-bitesize-launches-new-campaign-to-support-pupils-preparing-for-secondary-school/,"BBC Bitesize, working with the charity YoungMinds, has announced its new campaign Starting Secondary School. The campaign is aimed at 10 to 12 year olds, parents and teachers and designed to help support the critical step of beginning secondary school. Packed with videos, interactive games, and tips and advice, Starting Secondary School will help children across the UK during their last term in primary school and through their critical first weeks at secondary school.
In September 2019, 752,528 children will move up to secondary school across the UK. Moving from primary to secondary school is an exciting time for many young people, but it can also be a daunting prospect. Research shows that, for some young people, it can negatively affect their social, emotional and academic outcomes leading to less engagement, lower attainment, reduced confidence, increased anxiety, loneliness and behaviour issues.
Helen Foulkes, Senior Head of Content Production, BBC Education said “Beginning secondary school is a huge milestone for children and research repeatedly shows that if it goes badly there can be long term consequences. The BBC is working in partnership with YoungMinds to help support children directly, but also provide advice for parents and resources for teachers. We hope this will further support the schools and charities working hard to ease transition at such an important time in children’s lives.”
Starting Secondary School has lots of content hosted on the ever-popular BBC Bitesize including:
· Peer-to-peer advice from the stars of CBBC series Our School who have first-hand experience of making the move to secondary school
· Practical tips for parents on how to prepare their child for secondary school
· Bespoke classroom clips and resources for teachers on BBC Teach, to help start discussions around transition, produced in partnership with YoungMinds
More content will be added each week at www.bbc.com/startingsecondaryschool
Deirdre Kehoe, Director of Training and Services, YoungMinds said “Starting secondary school can be a daunting and stressful experience for children, and, in some cases, it can coincide with the emergence of underlying mental health problems. That’s why we’re delighted to be working with BBC Education to make sure that children, parents and teachers are as well prepared as possible to cope with the change. We hope that as many teachers as possible will use our Find Your Feet lesson plans and resources, as a way of helping children to face their worries, talk about how they feel and gain the skills to manage these challenges.”
Mr Burton, Headteacher, and star of Channel 4’s Educating Yorkshire is supporting Starting Secondary School and said: “Children’s biggest fears when they start school can range from losing contact with their old friends, to coping with the extra demands of daily homework, to getting lost in a much bigger building. Starting Secondary School addresses these issues, and others, in the rich variety of content that will appeal to young people. These are important and useful resources that will help students and teachers.”
Dr Anna Colton, child and adolescent psychologist welcomed the new BBC campaign and said: “Primary school is nurturing, familiar and comfortable. Some children can’t wait to move to secondary, having outgrown it and others will feel scared and wish they could stay for longer. Whichever is the case, a successful transition will provide challenges to which they will rise and thus give a child new skills, confidence and resilience, teaching them that they can cope and survive.
“Addressing children’s worries throughout the process and giving them opportunities to experience and talk about the next steps will help prepare them for what lies ahead and how they might handle it. Poor transition can have a detrimental impact to children’s well being, mental health and attainment, so equipping children with the tools to cope with the unfamiliar and with challenges and changes should be welcomed and shared widely. I am delighted to support and help shine a light on this important campaign.”

Record year for Big Pedal 2019 competition – Education Today,"['Health, Hygiene & Safety', 'News', 'Road safety', 'Sport & Play']","May 16, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/record-year-for-big-pedal-2019-competition/,"This year’s Sustrans Big Pedal, the UK’s largest cycling, scooting and walking competition for schools, saw a record 3.8 million journeys made by bike, foot or scooter as children and parents ditched their cars for their journey to and from school.
The largest number of pupils took part in the 10-day challenge to date, with 559,629 participants walking, scooting or cycling the equivalent of 11.9 million miles – that’s 50 trips to the moon and back or 480 trips around the world.
Forty of the participating schools, working with Sustrans and their local authority, trialled School Streets where they closed their streets to motor vehicles during pick up and drop off times, to create a safer, car-free environment for families to cycle, walk and scoot.
Overall the number of sustainable trips prevented 4.7 million car journeys, saving parents an estimated £1.6 million on petrol.
Xavier Brice, Sustrans for CEO, said: “This year’s Big Pedal saw the highest number of pupils and parents take part since we first launched the competition back in 2010. This is a fantastic achievement, which tells us that children want to cycle, scoot and walk to school.
“It also demonstrates there’s a growing public awareness of the effects of motor emissions and the role more walking and cycling can play in reducing them. But to make it easier for parents and pupils to continue travel by bike and foot, the roads outside schools need to feel safe. One of the best ways to do this is by making streets outside the school gates car free.
“That’s why we are calling on national governments to support local authorities to enforce School Streets and implement clean air legislation to tackle motorised traffic, including large-scale investment in walking and cycling.”
Claudine Richardson, Bike It Champion at St Richard Reynolds Catholic College said: “We decided to take part in the Big Pedal this year as a survey of our students revealed that air pollution and congestion outside the school gate was a big concern.
“During the competition we saw a huge surge in the number of pupils walking, scooting or cycling to school and this has continued even after the challenge. It is fantastic to see the pupils come in so energised in the morning after a brisk walk or cycle.”
The 10-day challenge saw more than 1,682 schools take part in the competition.
The switch to an active journey to school burnt over 226 million calories in total, which is the equivalent of 936,704 donuts.
Currently almost a third (28%) of all children aged two to 15 in England are overweight or obese and half of seven-year-olds are not getting the recommended 60 minutes of daily physical activity. Walking, scooting or cycling to school could play a key role in helping children get their recommended hour of physical activity a day and enable them to maintain a healthy weight.
Organised by Sustrans, and sponsored by Micro Scooters and Tonik Energy, the Big Pedal, which took place from 25 March to 5 April, is the largest inter-school cycling, walking and scooting competition of its kind in the UK.

Tennis ace works with Altrincham pupils to raise awareness of mental health – Education Today,"['Mental health', 'News', 'Wellbeing']","May 14, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/tennis-ace-works-with-altrincham-pupils-to-raise-awareness-of-mental-health/,"Professional tennis ace and Youth Sport Trust athlete mentor, Anna Fitzpatrick, visited students from Altrincham Grammar School for Girls recently to raise awareness of the importance of mental health as part of the Greater Manchester Mentally Healthy Schools Project.
Her visit was part of a pilot project, commissioned by Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, to provide specialist mental health support for both pupils and teachers in primary and secondary schools across Greater Manchester.
The six-times Wimbledon competitor has been working with pupils to provide advice to help improve their confidence and reach their full potential.  Drawing on her own experiences, Anna has also been offering the students coaching in key life skills such as growing self-esteem, learning creative thinking skills and how to develop coping strategies for challenges.
The two-phase scheme involving 64 schools to date is a collaboration between Alliance for Learning Teaching School, Place2Be, children’s charity the Youth Sport Trust, Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership and 42nd Street.
Recent research has shown that physical activity boosts mental wellbeing, reduces anxiety and improves mood. Through workshops with Youth Sport Trust athlete mentors and Place2Be, young people are being supported to build their confidence and reach their full potential.
Alliance For Learning, the teaching school linked to Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, has trained the school leadership teams in mental health first aid and the project has offered schools guidance on how to work more effectively with children and young people experiencing mental health problems.  The scheme has also provided a simpler, easier way to refer into Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).
Anna Fitzpatrick, Youth Sport Trust athlete mentor says: “The Greater Manchester Mentally Healthy Schools Pilot is without a doubt one of the most powerful athlete mentor programmes I’ve worked on.  We’ve had some great discussions throughout the workshop sessions and I’m pleased to see how many of the pupils have been open to discussing their own sense of wellbeing and how best they can learn to manage it.”
Stephanie Gill Principal at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls says: “Our students have taken a great deal from this project so far. As a school, we feel we do a lot to support wellbeing already, but the extra training and the student workshops have enhanced our provision. We are thrilled our own teaching school is involved in the leadership of the project so that students beyond our own school can benefit. It is fantastic to see the links between mental health, sport and physicality activity being made explicit too.”",professional tennis ace and youth sport trust athlete mentor anna fitzpatrick visited student from altrincham grammar school for girl recently to raise awareness of the importance of mental health a part of the greater manchester mentally healthy school project her visit wa part of a pilot project commissioned by greater manchester health and social care partnership to provide specialist mental health support for both pupil and teacher in primary and secondary school across greater manchester the sixtimes wimbledon competitor ha been working with pupil to provide advice to help improve their confidence and reach their full potential drawing on her own experience anna ha also been offering the student coaching in key life skill such a growing selfesteem learning creative thinking skill and how to develop coping strategy for challenge the twophase scheme involving school to date is a collaboration between alliance for learning teaching school placebe childrens charity the youth sport trust greater manchester health and social care partnership and nd street recent research ha shown that physical activity boost mental wellbeing reduces anxiety and improves mood through workshop with youth sport trust athlete mentor and placebe young people are being supported to build their confidence and reach their full potential alliance for learning the teaching school linked to altrincham grammar school for girl ha trained the school leadership team in mental health first aid and the project ha offered school guidance on how to work more effectively with child and young people experiencing mental health problem the scheme ha also provided a simpler easier way to refer into child and adolescent mental health service camhs anna fitzpatrick youth sport trust athlete mentor say the greater manchester mentally healthy school pilot is without a doubt one of the most powerful athlete mentor programme ive worked on weve had some great discussion throughout the workshop session and im pleased to see how many of the pupil have been open to discussing their own sense of wellbeing and how best they can learn to manage it stephanie gill principal at altrincham grammar school for girl say our student have taken a great deal from this project so far a a school we feel we do a lot to support wellbeing already but the extra training and the student workshop have enhanced our provision we are thrilled our own teaching school is involved in the leadership of the project so that student beyond our own school can benefit it is fantastic to see the link between mental health sport and physicality activity being made explicit too,"['girl', 'mentor', 'competitor', 'teaching', 'principal', 'charity', 'coaching', 'teacher', 'tennis', 'wimbledon']"
V&A announces a new KS3 programme for every school in England to champion Design and Technology – Education Today,"['Art & Craft', 'Digital skills', 'KS3', 'News', 'Secondary schools', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","May 8, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/va-announces-a-new-ks3-programme-for-every-school-in-england-to-champion-design-and-technology/,"The V&A has launched its most ambitious ever schools programme, V&A Innovate, to champion Design and Technology (D&T) as an essential subject and exciting career pathway.  Available to every school in England, V&A Innovate introduces key stage 3 (KS3) students to core design principles used in industry to support teachers and prepare students for the new D&T GCSE.
Grounded in the V&A’s world-leading collections, exhibition research and cutting-edge industry practice, V&A Innovate has been created with teachers and designers to equip young people at KS3 level with the confidence and skills to develop solutions for real-world issues. Designed to be as flexible as possible, V&A Innovate can be delivered over one term, in an after-school club, over a few weeks, or intensively over one day.
Available now, teachers are encouraged to access the V&A’s new online resource hub, featuring free, downloadable resources and to sign-up to a new V&A National Schools Challenge, which opens September 2019. Key features include toolkits, animated video guides, and a range of activities to bring the challenge to life in the classroom and unlock the creative potential of the next generation of designers, makers and creatives.
(c) Victoria and Albert Museum, London
To showcase the breadth, diversity and relevance of D&T, a series of interviews with contemporary designers and makers on their practice are included in the programme resources. Professional Development training will be also available for teachers through workshops delivered nationally by V&A Learning practitioners, designers and creatives.
 Part of the V&A Innovate programme, the V&A National Schools Challenge invites KS3 students in state funded education to submit their projects – from September onwards – with the chance to have them showcased at a special awards day hosted at the V&A in early 2020. Finalists will be invited to pitch their ideas to a panel of judges who include some of the most high-profile creatives and designers in fashion, sustainability, manufacturing, art and design.
V&A Innovate 2019/20’s themes are inspired by the V&A’s exhibition programme:

GO – How might we give more people the ability to be mobile, and give people and the planet a better chance to breathe?
EAT – How might we ensure that the way we eat is sustainable, and give more people access to affordable and healthy food?
WEAR – How might we ensure that what we wear is part of building a better world?

V&A Innovate introduces KS3 students to the design thinking model used by industry. The model includes three stages; Collect, focuses on equipping young people to think critically and collaborate through exploration and research of their chosen idea; Make, nurtures problem solving skills and building confidence through testing and prototyping; and Share guides young people through a series of activities and design processes with suggestions for how to refine and articulate their narrative to help make change happen.
According to Dr Helen Charman, Director of Learning and National Programmes at the V&A, “V&A Innovate supports D&T teachers and young people at a pivotal point in their education and showcases their subject as a vital component of a balanced curriculum and exciting career pathway.
“With the recent decline in young people taking up arts subjects as GCSEs, we have developed Innovate to inspire secondary school students to continue to study Design and Technology. We know that the subject can open the doors of possibility and encourage young people to become the next generation of designers and makers.
“By equipping young people with design-led skills needed for the twenty first century, V&A Innovate delivers on the V&A’s founding mission to be ‘a schoolroom for everyone’ and provides them with an unmissable opportunity to present their ideas to some of the most influential and forward-thinking names in the creative industries.”
Linda Hill, Design and Technology Teacher, Coundon Court School in Coventry, said: “It is said that 65% tomorrow’s workers will be employed in jobs that do not exist today; nurturing young people’s agility in creative thinking and problem solving is therefore vital to their and the UK’s future.
 “At KS3, students are already making key decisions about their future pathways. Engaging them in opportunities to design and model solutions for real life issues to improve the world around them, will be for the benefit of all.
“Design and Technology is unique in that it combines technical knowledge with innovative thinking and practical skills to enable students to design solutions that meet a need using a variety of media including digital technologies.”

Comedian Harry Hill joins Beano to hunt for Britain’s funniest primary school class – Education Today,"['Competition', 'News', 'Primary schools']","May 2, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/comedian-harry-hill-joins-beano-to-hunt-for-britains-funniest-primary-school-class/,"Iconic British comedian and author Harry Hill has been announced as special guest judge in Beano’s nationwide search to find Britain’s Funniest Class.
Teachers up and down the country have until May 10th to put forward their class’ very best jokes, gags and funnies to be in with a chance of being crowned the winner.
The top ten jokes chosen by Harry Hill and Beano’s gag makers will appear on Beano.com with kids voting to decide who will be Britain’s funniest class. The winner and two runners-up will each receive a bundle of Beano annuals comic subscriptions and a special VIP Beano visit, including a joke workshop.
Primary school across the UK can submit their classes’ jokes up until 10th May 2019 online at https://schools.beano.com/
Last year the iconic TV presenter released his second book in the ‘Matt Millz’ series to inspire kids to start out in comedy. ‘Matt Millz Stands Up!’ tells the story of the youngest comedian in the world facing the fickle finger of fame.
Harry Hill said: “This competition is an incredible opportunity for British kids to release their inner-comedian and let loose their imaginations. It’s a great way for kids to show they know best when it comes to telling rib-tickling jokes and show the adults how it’s done.”
Mike Stirling, Editorial Director at Beano Studios said: “At Beano we’ve been giggling with kids for 80 years and we are on a mission to spread their much needed humour across the UK.

How can you boost Literacy and attainment at KS3? – Education Today,['News'],"April 29, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/how-can-you-boost-literacy-and-attainment-at-ks3/,"A cutting edge secondary literacy intervention is helping pupils across England to fulfill their academic potential, in an effort to close the attainment gap in education. The Literacy Intervention Toolkit (LIT) Programme from Hackney Learning Trust uses mindful and metacognitive teaching strategies to enable Year 7 pupils to become more autonomous and confident in all aspects of literacy. LIT uses evidence-based strategies focused on improving thinking, reading, writing and oral communication skills. It also incorporates effective feedback into each lesson so that pupil progress is maximized.
The new proposed Ofsted framework shifts greater focus towards pupils’ qualitative experiences at school, such as their capacity for learning and how they feel about learning, while still looking closely at academic progress.  This proposed inspection framework further underlines the need for outstanding teachers to identify and correct understanding, so that on the spot feedback can be incisive and effective for facilitating pupil progress.
LIT tackles each of these areas by building ‘key learning checkpoints’ (KLCs) into each lesson plan and pupil resource that enable teachers and pupils to assess their use of a range of literacy strategies. Learning is externalised and dialogic, meaning that learning focuses and strategies are constantly reflected on and talked about. These KLCs are also designed to check the depth of understanding of a broad and meaningful curriculum. Creative and age-appropriate texts and topics are coupled with the KLCs with the aim of ensuring pupils are engaged and intrinsically motivated to learn. In this way, LIT builds pupils’ self-awareness and capacity for learning while simultaneously deepening their subject knowledge and understanding.
Sam Henstock, LIT Programme coordinator at Ashfield School, one of the largest secondary schools in the country, reports that their LIT pupils make an average of 3 years of reading age progress in a single academic year.
“While the levels of attainment are excellent, I think other benefits are equally as important. Numbers aside, the visible improvements in students’ overall confidence and feelings towards reading are extremely rewarding, especially as such positivity continues into Year 8.”
Beyond academic progress, LIT equips pupils with thinking, reading, writing and communication strategies that can change their lives academically, socially and professionally. In this way, LIT aims to prepare pupils for the next stage of their lives and to have a lasting and meaningful impact.

Michelle Obama’s bestselling memoir inspires new teaching resource to boost secondary students’ literacy skills and confidence – Education Today,"['Leadership', 'Literacy', 'News', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","April 9, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/michelle-obamas-bestselling-memoir-inspires-new-teaching-resource-to-boost-secondary-students-literacy-skills-and-confidence/,"Penguin and the National Literacy Trust have teamed up to launch a free teaching resource inspired by Michelle Obama’s bestselling memoir, Becoming, to boost secondary students’ literacy skills, leadership abilities and confidence: literacytrust.org.uk/becoming.
Literacy levels and confidence amongst England’s young people is worryingly low. Last year, a third (36%) of 16-year-olds failed to get a good grade in English language GCSE and more than a quarter (28%) of young people reported feeling like they are going to fail in life.
Building on Becoming’s central themes of empowerment through education and the important role of self-belief in achieving your potential, the new teaching resource features a range of activities designed to give students in Key Stages 3-5 new opportunities to use and develop their reading, writing, speaking and listening skills.
The resource also includes a wealth of motivational materials for students, including excerpts from Becoming, a video link to Michelle Obama’s Penguin Talks event with students at Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School in London, and a clip of her final speech as First Lady of the United States.
The publication of the resource kick starts a week of activity to celebrate Becoming, which includes the BGF x Becoming Festival from Black Girl Fest and Penguin from 9-11 April, and culminates with Michelle Obama’s appearance at The O2 this Sunday as part of her sold-out Becoming book tour.
The publication of the resource follows the launch of the National Literacy Trust’s Words for Work: Women in Leadership programme in partnership with Lancôme, which supports girls and young women to develop the literacy skills, leadership abilities and confidence they need to achieve their potential. The programme also aims to broaden young women’s career aspirations by giving them the opportunity to both hear from and question women in work about their journeys to success, the challenges they faced and how they overcame them.
Billie Dunne, Words for Work Programme Manager at the National Literacy Trust, said: “Michelle Obama is one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. We are so thrilled to have teamed up with Penguin to bring the former First Lady’s inspirational words and powerful messages around the importance of education, self-belief and community into UK classrooms. Through this resource and our Words for Work: Women in Leadership programme, we hope to empower a whole new generation of young people to use and develop the literacy skills they need to lead happy and successful lives.”
Amelia Fairney, Communications Director at Penguin Group UK, said: “Penguin is delighted to partner with the National Literacy Trust on the Becoming resource pack in order to in bring Michelle Obama’s messages of the value of education and self-empowerment to a wide audience of young people across the UK.”

Young creatives recognised in national awards – Education Today,"['Apprenticeships', 'Awards', 'Careers', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Reward & Recognition']","April 3, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/young-creatives-recognised-in-national-awards/,"Young people, individuals and organisations, which demonstrate excellence in the UK’s cultural sector, were celebrated last night [1 April] at a glittering awards ceremony dedicated to the industry’s unsung heroes.
Apprentices, interns and mentors were among those recognised at the seventh annual Creative & Cultural Skills Awards, held in Cardiff for the first time at the National Museum Cardiff.
Sophie Hukin
The awards are organised by Creative & Cultural Skills, an independent UK charity giving young people opportunities to work and learn in the creative industries, and are designed to shine a light on the individuals and organisations that have demonstrated outstanding commitment to skills development and learning in the sector.
This year, two young women were jointly awarded the prestigious title of ‘Apprentice of the Year’ for their exceptional commitment and ambition to learning new skills.
Judges were unable to choose between the drive shown by Fionnuala Cush, 25, in her role at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich – an Irish language, arts and cultural centre in West Belfast, and the leadership skills of Sophie Hukin, 22, of SharpFutures in Manchester – a social enterprise that supports diverse young people into employment in the creative digital and tech sectors.
Ms Cush began her apprenticeship on the centre’s welcome desk but, after seeking out additional training and attending courses and night school, began proactively seeking greater responsibility before being appointed business development officer – a role created specifically for her.
She said: “I thoroughly enjoyed my apprenticeship at Cultúrlann and grabbed every opportunity to gain additional skills and take on more responsibility. It ended in a permanent role for me, which has been fantastic. I’d recommend an apprenticeship in this sector to anyone – it’s a brilliant opportunity to learn on the job.”
Meanwhile, Ms Hukin has helped SharpFutures close the social mobility gap for young people who want to break into the creative digital and tech sectors but have no work experience and minimal connections. Her achievements include promoting ways for young people to access employment in the sector and advising students on pathways to long-term work.
Ms Hukin added: “My apprenticeships at SharpFutures opened the door to a career in a sector I love. I enjoyed every moment of my time as an apprentice so to get this award is just the icing on the cake.
“My apprenticeships have enabled me to do a job where I am now able to advise other young people on the additional training or skills they need to get them where they want to be in their career. It’s been hugely rewarding and I’d recommend an apprenticeship to anyone.”
Fionnuala Cush
More than 200 people attended this year’s awards and dinner, which were presented by Angharad Lee, a freelance director of theatre, opera and film, and David Anderson, director general of National Museum Wales. Entertainment was provided by Rubicon Dance, a community dance development organisation for Cardiff and Newport.
The ceremony followed the tenth Creative & Cultural Skills National Conference, which took place on the same day in Cardiff City Hall and featured senior leaders from organisations including the Arts Council of Wales, the Wales Millennium Centre and the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The conference explored the barriers to entry into the creative and cultural sector, and what stops people from thriving within it.
Recent research published by Creative & Cultural Skills reveals that there were 1,175,546 people working in the creative industry[2] in the UK in 2018, with 25% of these aged between 16-29 years old, in sectors as diverse as literature (31%), performing arts (21%), visual arts (15%), cultural heritage (13%), design (13%), music (4%) and craft (3%).
Simon Dancey, chief executive of Creative & Cultural Skills, said: “To be a part of this inspirational event, surrounded by individuals and organisations working passionately to shift the persisting inequalities in the UK’s cultural sector, has been a privilege.
“Both Fionnuala and Sophie demonstrate the value apprenticeships can provide both to those who may not do well academically but thrive in the right setting, and to the creative sector generally.
“Our awards are about celebrating people who demonstrate the skills, passion and commitment required to make lasting change to the organisations they work for – regardless of their academic background.
“Our winners, and all those nominated, are further evidence of the need for more employers in the cultural sector to shift their recruitment cultures, embrace apprenticeships and improve their workforce diversity. I have no doubt the apprentices, interns and trainees nominated will all have a fantastic career ahead of them in the cultural sector.”",young people individual and organisation which demonstrate excellence in the uk cultural sector were celebrated last night april at a glittering award ceremony dedicated to the industry unsung hero apprentice intern and mentor were among those recognised at the seventh annual creative cultural skill award held in cardiff for the first time at the national museum cardiff sophie hukin the award are organised by creative cultural skill an independent uk charity giving young people opportunity to work and learn in the creative industry and are designed to shine a light on the individual and organisation that have demonstrated outstanding commitment to skill development and learning in the sector this year two young woman were jointly awarded the prestigious title of apprentice of the year for their exceptional commitment and ambition to learning new skill judge were unable to choose between the drive shown by fionnuala cush in her role at cultúrlann mcadam ó fiaich an irish language art and cultural centre in west belfast and the leadership skill of sophie hukin of sharpfutures in manchester a social enterprise that support diverse young people into employment in the creative digital and tech sector m cush began her apprenticeship on the centre welcome desk but after seeking out additional training and attending course and night school began proactively seeking greater responsibility before being appointed business development officer a role created specifically for her she said i thoroughly enjoyed my apprenticeship at cultúrlann and grabbed every opportunity to gain additional skill and take on more responsibility it ended in a permanent role for me which ha been fantastic id recommend an apprenticeship in this sector to anyone it a brilliant opportunity to learn on the job meanwhile m hukin ha helped sharpfutures close the social mobility gap for young people who want to break into the creative digital and tech sector but have no work experience and minimal connection her achievement include promoting way for young people to access employment in the sector and advising student on pathway to longterm work m hukin added my apprenticeship at sharpfutures opened the door to a career in a sector i love i enjoyed every moment of my time a an apprentice so to get this award is just the icing on the cake my apprenticeship have enabled me to do a job where i am now able to advise other young people on the additional training or skill they need to get them where they want to be in their career it been hugely rewarding and id recommend an apprenticeship to anyone fionnuala cush more than people attended this year award and dinner which were presented by angharad lee a freelance director of theatre opera and film and david anderson director general of national museum wale entertainment wa provided by rubicon dance a community dance development organisation for cardiff and newport the ceremony followed the tenth creative cultural skill national conference which took place on the same day in cardiff city hall and featured senior leader from organisation including the art council of wale the wale millennium centre and the department of business energy and industrial strategy the conference explored the barrier to entry into the creative and cultural sector and what stop people from thriving within it recent research published by creative cultural skill reveals that there were people working in the creative industry in the uk in with of these aged between year old in sector a diverse a literature performing art visual art cultural heritage design music and craft simon dancey chief executive of creative cultural skill said to be a part of this inspirational event surrounded by individual and organisation working passionately to shift the persisting inequality in the uk cultural sector ha been a privilege both fionnuala and sophie demonstrate the value apprenticeship can provide both to those who may not do well academically but thrive in the right setting and to the creative sector generally our award are about celebrating people who demonstrate the skill passion and commitment required to make lasting change to the organisation they work for regardless of their academic background our winner and all those nominated are further evidence of the need for more employer in the cultural sector to shift their recruitment culture embrace apprenticeship and improve their workforce diversity i have no doubt the apprentice intern and trainee nominated will all have a fantastic career ahead of them in the cultural sector,"['celebrated', 'student', 'rewarding', 'dinner', 'cake', 'april', 'annual', 'millennium', 'charity', 'celebrating']"
Education Secretary joins alumni to inspire Alton students to career success – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Educational event', 'News']","March 26, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/education-secretary-joins-alumni-to-inspire-alton-students-to-career-success/,"Education Secretary Damian Hinds joined alumni from an Alton school who returned to inspire the current generation to career confidence and academic success.
The former students and Mr Hinds returned to Eggar’s School to take part in an event designed to help prepare students for life in the working world and broaden their career horizons.
Eggar’s School is one of a thousand state schools and colleges across Britain which have worked with the national education charity Future First to harness the experience of former students to motivate the current generation through ‘old school tie’ networks.
Alumni were among 28 professionals who advised 375 students in Years 8 and 10 on writing a personal statement which then formed the basis of a mock interview.
Mr Hinds interviewed Head boy Rory Roberts Taylor who hopes to go into politics.
Alumni included Rob Priestley, Maritime Operations Controller at H.M Coastguard, who said, ‘It was the first time I have set foot in the school since I left in 2002. It was very encouraging to see the students are receiving a well-rounded and broad education involving both academic and life skills.’
Other returning alumni included Catherine Davis and Grace Brassington who works in television production.
Community Liaison Officer Sarah McKenzie who organised the event said, ‘Bringing back former students as interviewers resonated with our students and we are looking forward to engaging with our alumni network to support more events at the school.’
Future First’svision is that every state school or college should be supported by a thriving, engaged alumni community that helps it to do more for its students. Nearly 240,000 former students across Britain have already signed up to stay connected with their old school or college. They’re inspiring young people as career and education role models, mentors or e-mentors, work experience providers, governors and fundraisers.
Matt Lent, Chief Executive Officer of Future First said, ‘Students cannot be what they cannot see. It is vital to open their eyes to opportunities beyond their own world and show them the range of jobs available. Alumni help schools do this by acting as relatable positive role models. If a student sees someone who has the same background has gone on to achieve success, they are far more likely to think they can too.’

Coventry pupils experience history coming to life – Education Today,"['English', 'History', 'KS1', 'News', 'Student engagement']","March 25, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/coventry-pupils-experience-history-coming-to-life/,"History came to life at a Coventry primary school as children dressed up in period clothing and learned all about the Great Fire of London thanks to a specialist history teaching company.
Year Two pupils at Sacred Heart Catholic School, part of the Romero Catholic Academy, were visited by ‘History Off The Page’ – a teaching company which visits schools to provide fun, practical lessons about a variety of historical topics.
The children enjoyed re-enacting what life would have been like on Pudding Lane – where the fire started – in 1666.
In the morning, the pupils tried their hands at various trades common to London at the time, including candle making, haberdashery and bread baking.
Later in the afternoon, the fire was simulated through the use of a smoke machine while pupils had to try and tear down ‘debris’ and find legal documents to help start rebuilding the city.
The pupils were helped on the day by sixth formers from Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School – also part of the Romero Academy Group – who are studying history themselves.
Phase Leader of Year One and Two, Lauren Roberts, felt the day was a great way to engage the children in their studies in a unique way.
She said: “We have a thematic curriculum at Sacred Heart, which means our pupils focus on a particular topic, such as the Great Fire of London, across several subjects. We’ve covered it in history, geography, English and science.
“We always like to try and incorporate days like this for the Year Two pupils around three times a year if we can.
“Getting History Off The Page in was brilliant – the children almost didn’t realise they were in a history lesson as they were having so much fun.
“They loved dressing up for the day, and the variety of activities meant every child found something interesting to do.”
And Sacred Heart’s Principal Paul Madia said a day like this was an example of a ‘wow day’ – where the school puts on special lessons which the children will remember for a long time.
“We try to end topics covered in our curriculum with a special day like this,” he said.

Robot-savvy students secure once-in-a-lifetime chance to represent the UK at global robotics tournament in the USA – Education Today,"['Competition', 'Computing', 'Digital skills', 'Educational event', 'News', 'STEM']","March 14, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/robot-savvy-students-secure-once-in-a-lifetime-chance-to-represent-the-uk-at-global-robotics-tournament-in-the-usa/,"Almost 500 students from across the South of England gathered at the KingsGate Conference Centre in Peterborough this week (Wednesday 13 March) to compete in the inaugural FIRST® Tech Challenge UK Championships. Team St Christopher’s Snowflakes from St Christopher School, Letchworth Garden City were named FIRST® Tech Challenge UK Inspire Award winners and, with the support of Cambridge-based global technology firm Arm, will represent the UK at the FIRST® Championships held in Detroit, USA between 24 – 27 April 2019. The team joins 30,000 students competing head to head to be crowned global champions at the world’s largest student robotics competition.
FIRST® Tech Challenge is an expeditionary robotics programme for ages 12-18, seeking to build relationships between today’s professionals and tomorrow’s talent. Working in teams of up to 15, and supported by an industry mentor, young people design, build and programme a robot to compete in the annual championships. Team members assume individual and collaborative roles reflective of real-life careers – from software engineers and designers, to project managers and communications officers – all play a part in becoming competition-ready.
During the Championship event in Peterborough, teams competed against each other within alliances, using their robots to complete a series of tasks on a space-themed playing field. Teams were also required to present engineering notebooks, documenting their journey through the programme, to a panel of industry judges.
Honey Glennie from St Christopher’s Snowflakes comments: “It hasn’t properly sunk in yet that we have won the Inspire Award and will be heading to Detroit! We feel so shocked – winning is a dream come true. We can’t wait to head to America, our teacher is from America so it will be really special. A particular highlight for all of us was all the people that we met today, all the teams were amazing and deserve a shout out.”
FIRST® Tech Challenge is backed by leading industries keen to address the burgeoning STEM skills crisis. Industry mentors have been supporting the teams throughout the programme – helping to ease the load for educators whilst forging important relationships between schools and industry. Arm is the headline sponsor of the Southern championship who, alongside other local employers, provided staff volunteers to steward, judge and referee the Championships.
Maths education extraordinaire, author and TV personality, Bobby Seagull, supported the event as Master of Ceremonies. Bobby engaged the students with a captivating speech during the opening ceremony, got stuck in commentating on robot matches, and interacted with the teams as they practised with their robots throughout the day.
Ed Cervantes-Watson, FIRST® UK CEO comments: “FIRST® Tech Challenge is more than robots – it’s a vast collaborative effort between the young people involved and the hundreds of industry mentors, teachers and volunteers who invest their time and energy to inspire the next generation. We’re not setting out to find next Steve Jobs, but if the 1,500 participants this year are less intimated by STEM, more aware of subject choices and career pathways available, and have developed the technical know-how and core life skills needed to better take on tomorrow’s challenges – then that’s mission accomplished.”

Rounders England launches National Primary Schools event – Education Today,"['Competition', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Sport & Play']","March 7, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/rounders-england-launches-national-primary-schools-event/,"Rounders England has today launched a national Rounders competition for primary schools, which is aimed at broadening social circles and creating a fun way to keep active.

The event – Primary Ready Rounders – forms part of Rounders England’s Competition Strategy, which promotes the social and fun aspects of rounders on a national scale to both broaden its appeal to players and encourage more rounders to be played within the Rounders community.

The announcement follows a period of detailed research, which explored the motivations and goals of the rounders community. It found an increased focus on fun and social activity and increased competition were key to support the continued growth within the sport.

Rounders England has put together a programme of events and competitions, which is made up of open contests for primary, secondary and independent schools and a special ‘Rounders Tour’ for universities.

Community teams and leagues are also being encouraged to get involved by taking part in Roundersfest, a series of standalone open competitions for local teams that play in local leagues or for new teams formed by groups of friends. There’s also Champion of Champions too, where the winners of leagues from across the country (both ladies and mixed) have the chance to battle it out for the prestigious Champion of Champions title.

All of the activities are designed to both broaden social circles and create a fun way to keep active, while fostering team spirit and creating a sense of competition amongst teams.

Dan Newton at Rounders England, said: “The programme that we have developed is one which has two strands around team spirit and winning and the social and fun aspects of Rounders to complement the cross-generational, cross-gender game that embraces all abilities. You don’t have to be the fittest, the youngest or the most athletic. You just have to go out and play.”

“The social aspect of Rounders is a key ingredient in its success. Rounders provides opportunities for people to meet others, have fun, make friends, play in a friendly environment and be part of a team.”

“Our competitions are aimed at children of all abilities and motivations who play our sport. Not only will children come away from the day having had fun while keeping active, they’ll have developed their social and team-building skills and sharpened their rounders play. We’re hoping as many primary schools as possible will rise to the challenge and take part in one, or more, of our competitions this year. They are so many benefits to rounders and we want to make sure they’re being shared far and wide.”

New study reveals primary school aged children learn better after physical activity – Education Today,"['KS1', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Sport & Play']","March 6, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-study-reveals-primary-school-aged-children-learn-better-after-physical-activity/,"A new Super Movers study has demonstrated the positive effect exercise has on the learning power of children at primary school age. The study looked at the impact of physical activity on behaviour and classroom achievement, with 77% of participating schools noting an improvement in brain function and learning in their pupils after exercise.
Super Movers is a BBC and Premier League initiative which helps teachers inspire primary school children to get more active and boost their learning throughout their school day.
The research was led by the Super Movers team and Professor Eef Hogervorst, Professor of Biological Psychology in the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University.  The study tested the impact of physical activity and the effects it has on learning with more than 1,000 pupils from 17 primary schools from across the UK.
The school children were split into two groups – a group that exercised and a group that did not. The exercise group completed 50 minutes of physical activity – including circuit-style training and choreography copied from Super Movers active classroom resources – and then performed a series of cognitive tasks to establish if the exercise helped boost their attention span and improve their learning, compared to their classmates who did no physical activity.
Findings from the study indicated that brain speed, the ability to process information and apply it to tasks, increased by up to 19% after exercise. Physical activity also significantly improved mood in all the children who exercised, with twice as many boys in the exercise group showing a clear link between improved mood and increased brain speed compared to the non-exercise control group.
Professor Eef Hogervorst said: “The nationwide experiment has yielded some really encouraging results and shows that with less than an hour of enjoyable physical exercise in a day, we can see some real improvements to children’s learning. It has long been established that exercise can boost brain function, but to see such significant results across the board confirms that fun exercise, like the Super Movers resources, can make a real difference.”

Belling relaunches “Cookery Club” scheme for primary schools – Education Today,"['Catering & Nutrition', 'Competition', 'KS1', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools']","February 28, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/belling-relaunches-cookery-club-scheme-for-primary-schools/,"UK home appliance brand Belling has re-launched Belling Cookery Club, an initiative to support primary schools and enable them to provide practical cookery classes for children.
The first phase of the initiative was a huge success, with schools in Dumfries and London winning an array of cooking appliances and accessories that have transformed their ability to provide hand-on cooking sessions, as well as supporting their local communities.
Belling Cookery Club was launched to support the estimated 75% of primary schools that don’t have a teaching kitchen. For this reason, and despite cooking and nutrition now forming part of the curriculum across the UK, it is believed that the majority of Key Stage 1 and 2 pupils don’t receive practical cookery experiences.
Belling, which has been at the heart of British cooking for more than a century, is hoping the Cookery Club initiative will play a part in helping the next generation embrace a love of cooking. Every year, Belling will award two primary schools with up to £2,000 worth of cooking appliances, along with fun cooking accessories for the children to use.
The competition is open to all primary schools, with pupils asked to produce a picture of their favourite nutritionally balanced meal, along with a description of why they like it so much and why it’s good for them. Pupils can work on the entry individually or as a class, and each school is asked to select a single entry to be sent to Belling alongside a brief explanation from a member of teaching staff about the school’s existing facilities and what winning the prize would enable them to do. Entries can be as fun and creative as the children like.
Jane Rylands, Head of Marketing Communications at Belling, said: “We had a great response to Cookery Club last year and we loved looking at all the entries.
“We believe children get so much out of learning to cook – physically interacting with ingredients and producing their own food; learning new skills for later life and understanding what is good for them and why. We hope that Belling Cookery Club will give some schools a valuable resource and inspire their pupils to love cooking.”
Belling Cookery Club is now open (until Friday April  5th)  for entry via the Belling website on https://www.belling.co.uk/cookery-club/ where full details, along with Terms and Conditions are available.

Cambridgeshire’s innovators of tomorrow get robot ready – Education Today,"['Competition', 'Computing', 'News', 'Reward & Recognition', 'Secondary schools', 'STEM']","February 22, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/cambridgeshires-innovators-of-tomorrow-get-robot-ready/,"Students from schools across Cambridgeshire are gearing up to compete in the inaugural FIRST® Tech Challenge UK Championships, taking place in Peterborough on Wednesday 13th March. One winning team from the event will progress to represent the UK in the global championships in the USA in April.
FIRST® Tech Challenge UK is an inclusive robotics programme for ages 12-18, which brings young people together with mentors from industry, in teams up to 15, to design and build a robot to compete in a series of challenges. Collaboration is key and everyone has a part to play throughout the six-month programme – roles are linked to real-world careers and are intended to help young people discover the practical and life skills needed for their future.
An extra-curricular STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths) enrichment activity, the FIRST® Tech Challenge UK programme is backed by leading industries keen to address the emerging STEM skills crisis. FIRST® UK’s employees and industry partners meet regularly with teams, acting as coaches and career role models, whilst easing the load for educators and forging important relationships between schools and industry. In addition to mentors, local employers also provide staff volunteers to support with on-the-day stewarding, judging and refereeing.
Whilst the programme attracts 500,000+ participants annually in the USA, this is the first time the initiative has run in the UK. 100 teams, equating to approximately 1500 students, are participating in the inaugural championship events (Peterborough, March 13th and Manchester, March 15th). The winning team from each regional final will be fully funded to attend the global championships in the USA, where they will go head-to-head with teams from all over world.
This year, participating teams were provided with charity bursaries to cover the cost of the robotics kits, phones, and resources, as well as travel awards to take part in the competition. The robotics kits are reusable from year to year providing schools with a sustainable platform for robotics-based education.
Ed Cervantes-Watson, CEO, FIRST® UK, comments: “We’re counting down to one of the biggest student robotics competitions in the UK and we cannot wait to see what the teams have got to bring to the game field. Young people entering education today will be pursuing jobs which don’t yet exist. We need to equip tomorrow’s workforce with the technical know-how and core life skills they need to transform their futures – FIRST® Tech Challenge is more than just robots – it’s a platform for young people to become the innovators of tomorrow and ensure no-one is left behind.”
Arm is the headline sponsor of the Southern championships – Anna Malan, from Arm’s Diversity and Inclusion team, comments: “We need young people to be prepared for their futures, not just with the STEM skills and academic qualifications that employers such as Arm rely on – but critically the softer skills which make them great team players, who can positively contribute to all areas of our business, local community and society.”
The Southern Regional Championship will take place on Wednesday 13th March at the KingsGate Conference Centre in Peterborough and 50 teams will be participating, from schools including: Comberton Village College, Linton Village College, Witchford Village College, Chesterton Community College and Trumpington Community College, to name a few.

"Just Enough launches new Children’s Award with £1,000 cash prize – Education Today","['Competition', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Social issues']","January 30, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/just-enough-launches-new-childrens-award-with-1000-cash-prize/,"This year, education activist Just Enough is launching its Children’s Award and calling for nominations for this first of its kind prize. Children aged 4-12 who have done something extraordinary in their community are eligible to be nominated by school teachers in this national competition by Friday 15 February.
Every day children across the country undertake amazing, selfless acts. Just Enough, who run workshops in primary schools on challenging social issues, will award one such child with a £1,000 cash prize.
From caring for a sick loved one to charity fundraising or standing up for what they believe in – the award will go to an inspiring child whose amazing acts are helping to support their community.
Finalists will be announced in March before the winner is revealed in April. The winner of the award will receive a trophy and a cash prize of £1,000. A dream trip, a treat for their classmates, or banking it for future – the cash prize can be used however the child wishes to. We’ll be checking back in a year to see how they choose to spend the money!
Just Enough recognises children are the future and speaks to them – in language they understand – about real world issues that will impact their futures. The organisation goes in to primary schools and runs workshops on topics including: Modern Slavery, Hate Crime, County Lines, Anti Radicalisation and Knife Crime, helping schools and young people to understand and tackle these issues.
Phil Knight CEO and Founder, says: “At Just Enough we see remarkable children every day in our workshops. They do a brilliant job of understanding matters some of the world’s biggest politicians are yet to sort out!
“We also see so many examples of children undertaking kind and generous acts – not for reward or recognition but because they want to. We want to celebrate those who have been quietly making others’ lives better and inspire others to follow in their footsteps.”

"Birmingham school welcomes Shanghai maths experts and more than 1,000 teachers for open lessons – Education Today",['News'],"January 29, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/birmingham-school-welcomes-shanghai-maths-experts-and-more-than-1000-teachers-for-open-lessons/,"A Birmingham school has welcomed nearly 1,000 teachers from across the Midlands through its doors to watch a series of live maths lessons led by two expert teachers from China aimed at transforming the way maths is taught in UK primary schools.
Cedars Academy in Acocks Green, Birmingham, hosted two weeks of open lessons taught by visiting maths teachers, Crystal Liu and Ming Huang, to their pupils aged between 7 and 11 as part of an international education exchange programme.
Crystal and Ming, from Shanghai, showcased the ‘mastery’ approach which has helped China establish itself as a world leader in maths studies by helping children developing a deep, secure and fluent understanding of mathematical concepts and the ability to apply their knowledge to a variety of practical problems.
The visit, organised alongside the Central Maths Hub and the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM), saw around 100 teachers a day visit Cedars Academy to observe the lessons.
Faye Glendinning, Strategic Leader for Maths at Cedars Academy, visited Shanghai in December to learn more about the mastery approach before welcoming Crystal and Ming back to Birmingham.
Faye said: “The response to the showcase lessons has been incredible. They have helped to create a meaningful dialogue between teachers from all over the region which will have an impact on how our children are taught maths in the future. Our children have been fantastic and have really taken to Crystal and Ming with enthusiasm and showing our school in a really positive light to all of our visitors.

Her Royal Highness viewed Remember Me, a multimedia art installation by Professor Helen Newall, exploring the fragmentation of memory and identity in the context of WWI. She examined a selection of items relating to the University’s history and links with the suffragette movement in the archive, viewed demonstrations by the student wellbeing and campus life teams and met student volunteers, scholarship winners and alumni. She also saw a rehearsal of a suffragette themed play and learned about the University’s work with Tate Liverpool.
 
Dr John Cater, Vice-Chancellor at Edge Hill, said: “The University is exceedingly proud of our iconic, state-of-the-art, Catalyst Building which is transforming learning and support opportunities for over ten thousand students. We’re exceedingly proud that Her Royal Highness, The Princess Royal, kindly and generously agreed to formally open this stunning facility.” 
 
The Catalyst building has brought together several of Edge Hill’s student facing teams for the first time, giving them a prominent and highly visible presence at the heart of the campus.
 
The 8,000 square-metre space provides a 50 per cent increase in study spaces and houses 230,000 books on 5,000 shelves and its 24-hour opening gives students improved access to services.  
 
Confidential interview spaces, meeting areas, group rooms and waiting areas have been designed to ensure users receive the best possible service and experience. An event space and new facilities allows the Careers Service to showcase job opportunities and host employer events alongside mock interviews, CV workshops and ongoing career advice and support.  
 
Jacqui Howe, Head of Careers, said: “Since we moved into Catalyst we’ve seen an increase in the uptake of our services by students and increased engagement. As it houses the library, the building has a huge footfall and more students are dropping in to see us than ever before. We’re delighted that Her Royal Highness has met some of our fantastic volunteers today as volunteering is one of the main ways we help new students settle into university and the wider community. It not only gives them real transformable skills but also helps them make friends and grow in confidence.”",catalyst the new m home for the library career and student service function wa officially opened last week by her royal highness the princess royal her royal highness toured the stateoftheart building and met with student staff and alumnus a well a key people involved in the development and construction of catalyst before officially opening the building during her visit her royal highness had the opportunity to learn about research work in the biology department which focus on the eradication of major global health threat this included work on insecticide resistance in mosquito and research aimed at developing new antibiotic from strain of streptomyces bacteria professor clare austin director of medical education gave an overview of edge hill medical school which will train undergraduate from with a foundation year starting this year colleague also demonstrated key clinical skill equipment her royal highness viewed remember me a multimedia art installation by professor helen newall exploring the fragmentation of memory and identity in the context of wwi she examined a selection of item relating to the university history and link with the suffragette movement in the archive viewed demonstration by the student wellbeing and campus life team and met student volunteer scholarship winner and alumnus she also saw a rehearsal of a suffragette themed play and learned about the university work with tate liverpool dr john cater vicechancellor at edge hill said the university is exceedingly proud of our iconic stateoftheart catalyst building which is transforming learning and support opportunity for over ten thousand student were exceedingly proud that her royal highness the princess royal kindly and generously agreed to formally open this stunning facility the catalyst building ha brought together several of edge hill student facing team for the first time giving them a prominent and highly visible presence at the heart of the campus the squaremetre space provides a per cent increase in study space and house book on shelf and it hour opening give student improved access to service confidential interview space meeting area group room and waiting area have been designed to ensure user receive the best possible service and experience an event space and new facility allows the career service to showcase job opportunity and host employer event alongside mock interview cv workshop and ongoing career advice and support jacqui howe head of career said since we moved into catalyst weve seen an increase in the uptake of our service by student and increased engagement a it house the library the building ha a huge footfall and more student are dropping in to see u than ever before were delighted that her royal highness ha met some of our fantastic volunteer today a volunteering is one of the main way we help new student settle into university and the wider community it not only give them real transformable skill but also help them make friend and grow in confidence,"['volunteer', 'library', 'bacteria', 'undergraduate', 'antibiotic', 'insecticide', 'professor', 'volunteering', 'biology', 'suffragette']"

Schools to teach pupils about cutting back on sugar in maths and English lessons – Education Today,"['Health, Hygiene & Safety', 'News', 'Social issues', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources', 'Wellbeing']","January 14, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/schools-to-teach-pupils-about-cutting-back-on-sugar-in-maths-and-english-lessons/,"New Change4Life teaching resources will support teachers to use English and Maths lessons to help children cut back on sugar.
This comes as Public Health England (PHE) reveals the average 10 year old has already consumed at least 18 years’ worth of sugar. While children’s sugar intakes have declined slightly in recent years, they are still consuming around eight extra sugar cubes each day , equivalent to around 2,800 excess sugar cubes per year.
For the first time, PHE has developed dedicated English and Maths teaching resources for primary schools across England, to help pupils and their families understand how much sugar is in their food and drink. It will also teach them about making healthier swaps to reduce their sugar intake.
This will complement the national campaign encouraging parents to “make a swap when you next shop”, to help families enjoy healthier versions of the foods and drinks they are currently consuming.
Too much sugar can cause preventable health problems. Over a third (34%) of children are leaving primary school overweight or obese, and severe obesity in ten to eleven year olds has now reached an all-time high. More young people than ever before are also developing Type 2 diabetes, and every ten minutes a child in England has a rotten tooth removed in hospital.
While parents are encouraged to make healthier choices for the whole family, schools can also play an important role in children’s health, as part of a broader wellbeing programme.
Developed with teachers, the new English lesson plans introduce pupils to the characters of ‘Sugar Smart World’ through fun, interactive PowerPoints, pupil-led activities, recipe ideas from around the world and a new video. Change4Life Maths lesson plans will reinforce healthier swaps, while including important problem solving skills using addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.
Through the lesson activities, children will learn that the number of extra sugar cubes they are consuming is enough to wrap around the world more than three and a half times.
Jon Moorhouse, Deputy Headteacher, St Saviour CE Primary School, Bolton said: “Change4Life helps children realise just how much sugar is in everyday foods and drinks. The new resources are high quality, adaptable and can be used in other areas of the curriculum like Personal, Social and Health Education, English, Maths and Science.
“Being more sugar smart empowers children to help themselves and their families make healthier choices. This could have a big impact on children’s health for the rest of their lives.”
Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: “Children are consuming too much sugar and obesity is a very real threat to their health. Educating them on the importance of a healthy balanced diet in their early years can help them avoid serious illness in future.
“By making simple swaps each day, children can have healthier versions of everyday foods and drinks, while significantly reducing their sugar intake.”
The resources are flexible to use and tailored for Reception, Key Stage 1 and upper and lower Key Stage 2 pupils. They complement recently launched dental lesson plans – the first Change4Life teaching resources to help pupils understand the effects of sugar consumption on teeth.
To get involved with Change4Life, schools and teachers can:
• Look out for the Sugar Smart World take-home packs arriving in schools from mid-late January.
• Search ‘Change4Life/schools’ online or visit the School Zone to access the new resources for schools.
• Sign up to the School Zone to be the first to hear about new teaching resources launching later this year to help embed healthier habits in your school.

Montessori Centre International marks 20-year milestone – Education Today,"['News', 'Training']","January 8, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/montessori-centre-international-marks-20-year-milestone/,"Montessori Centre International (MCI), the leading provider of Montessori training courses, recently welcomed 80 new graduate practitioners.
MCI trains more than 300 students globally each year on its diploma, foundation degree and professional development Montessori courses. Montessori settings are enjoying revived interest from parents in the UK due to their practical approach, focus on outdoor learning and the way in which the environment allows the setting to guide children’s learning according to individual need and interest.
Marking the collaboration and 2018 graduation, MCI’s Director of Learning, Penny Johns said: “20 years marks a significant milestone for MCI. Whilst the way in which we deliver training has transformed, Montessori practice itself remains relatively unchanged. Students on our courses learn how to establish and implement a core set of values within a contemporary early years context. I’m delighted to welcome such a large number of new practitioners to Montessori and am confident this method of learning will continue to offer a counterbalance to today’s target driven education world.”
Montessori’s child-led approach stands out as it does not rely upon competitive measures of attainment and achievement. Instead, it focuses on what the individual child is ready to do and able to achieve and this requires a high degree of specialism, training and skill to deliver.
MCI courses are validated by London Metropolitan University and Cache/Crossfields Institute and offer flexible study routes that combine online and classroom based learning.  There is a strong focus on employability and work-based learning and MCI’s early years graduates are highly sought after and go onto work in early years settings across the UK and internationally.",montessori centre international mci the leading provider of montessori training course recently welcomed new graduate practitioner mci train more than student globally each year on it diploma foundation degree and professional development montessori course montessori setting are enjoying revived interest from parent in the uk due to their practical approach focus on outdoor learning and the way in which the environment allows the setting to guide childrens learning according to individual need and interest marking the collaboration and graduation mcis director of learning penny john said year mark a significant milestone for mci whilst the way in which we deliver training ha transformed montessori practice itself remains relatively unchanged student on our course learn how to establish and implement a core set of value within a contemporary early year context im delighted to welcome such a large number of new practitioner to montessori and am confident this method of learning will continue to offer a counterbalance to today target driven education world montessori childled approach stand out a it doe not rely upon competitive measure of attainment and achievement instead it focus on what the individual child is ready to do and able to achieve and this requires a high degree of specialism training and skill to deliver mci course are validated by london metropolitan university and cachecrossfields institute and offer flexible study route that combine online and classroom based learning there is a strong focus on employability and workbased learning and mcis early year graduate are highly sought after and go onto work in early year setting across the uk and internationally,"['practitioner', 'education', 'student', 'training', 'classroom', 'parent', 'workbased', 'professional', 'graduate', 'graduation']"

McDougalls Young Baking Team of the Year competition returns for its fifth year with new focus launched for 2019 – Education Today,"['Catering & Nutrition', 'Competition', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools']","January 3, 2019",https://www.education-today.co.uk/mcdougalls-young-baking-team-of-the-year-competition-returns-for-its-fifth-year-with-new-focus-launched-for-2019/,"Premier Foods is bringing back its McDougalls Young Baking Team of the Year competition for the fifth year running, and will focus on how cookery skills can help build children’s overall confidence.
Judges returning include – Carol Harwood, representing LACA; Andrew Green, representing the Craft Guild of Chefs; and Mark Rigby, Executive Chef at Premier Foods. After the recipe competition closes on Friday 17th May, the judges will whittle down the entries and invite five shortlisted teams to the live final at LACA – The Main Event on Thursday 11th July 2019.
Schools looking to bake their way to the top spot should recruit a team of up to three enthusiastic 7-11 year olds and register online from Wednesday, 2nd January. The winning team will take home the jackpot of £1,000 worth of equipment for their school kitchen, whilst each of the four runners up will win £250 worth of equipment. The competition theme will continue to focus on local produce, encouraging schools to source ingredients within a 30 mile radius of their school for their McDougalls recipes – helping children learn more about where their food comes from.
Mark Taylor, Customer Controller at Premier Foods, comments: “All the team here at Premier Foods look forward to the McDougalls Young Baking Team of the Year competition every year, it really is one of the highlights in the calendar. It has proved such an important tool for teaching children cookery skills, the importance of local ingredients and above all, has proved a real confidence booster for them. We have had many teachers and parents commenting to us after the competition, to let us know how far the children have come during the process, we’ve noticed it too and it’s so great to see at the live final each year.”
Nic Hastie, School Chef at St Martin and St Mary’s C of E Primary School, 2018 winner, comments: “Since winning the competition it has given both myself and the children a real confidence boost. It has really taught the children that if you work hard you can achieve your goals. When I look back to the beginning of the process, when we first started practicing for the competition and how they have come out of their shell since taking part and winning, it is incredible. The £1,000 prize money which we received as a result of our victory has been used to set up a weekly after school cookery club, it has paid for chef coats for the children and the equipment we need in order to make it a success. We launched this just after the October half term, opening it up to years three to six and we’ve already had over 40 sign ups. We’re really hoping it will encourage the children to start baking more at home too with their families.”
Schools up for the baking challenge can register their interest at www.premierfoodservice.co.uk and will receive a McDougalls toolkit within seven days which will include product samples, an application form and recipe inspiration. Teams will be asked to create either a sweet or savoury recipe, which includes one local ingredient and one McDougalls Flour Based Mix for submission.

Spaces to be uncertain: New initiative calls for conformity to be challenged in the classroom – Education Today,"['Alternative curriculum', 'Attainment', 'News', 'Policy']","December 11, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/spaces-to-be-uncertain-new-initiative-calls-for-conformity-to-be-challenged-in-the-classroom/,"A new campaign led by University of Sussex academics is urging teachers and pupils to be allowed to embrace uncertainty and explore new ways to engage with knowledge.
TRANSFORM-iN EDUCATION is designed to support teaching staff and pupils to have time and space within the day to break with convention which the campaign’s founders Dr Perpetua Kirby and Dr Rebecca Webb believe is necessary to ensure a creative and critical society where everyone is better able to respond to life situations where the answer is not always clear.
Dr Kirby and Dr Webb are looking to work with schools and other educational institutions, to support them to look beyond conformity within the school day, which they define as only learning what others already know to pass exams. The academics believe that while it is important to value existing knowledge, it is also vital to explore different ways of thinking and doing things.
Dr Webb, a Lecturer in Early Years and Primary Education at the University of Sussex, said: “In our current education system, children become successful by acquiring lots of curriculum knowledge and behaving in particular ways. Teachers, who, by implication, must never ‘not know’ and deviate from always explaining what things mean – this means constantly and continuously working ever harder to fill more efficiently and effectively the pupil with certain knowledge.
“We feel that this a really optimum time to launch this, it feels like there could be a positive reception for new thinking within the sector. Higher education encourages students to engage in transformative ‘disruptive thinking’, it’s certainly something we have put at the heart of what we do at the University of Sussex, and so it’s imperative that schools follow suit. ”
The campaigners say they want to help influence a change of policy on a national level and broaden the current models of education they have observed during in-depth research in schools which they say assumes certainty about the knowledge presented to students with very little time or opportunity for uncertainty.
They warn that there is currently too much emphasis on pupils conforming to the standards of good behaviour of prolonged sitting in silence and working hard to find the correct answer. Their research highlights that being good can camouflage an avoidance of effort for some pupils, including engaging in new and unexpected challenges where the answer is unclear.
Dr Webb and Dr Kirby stress the importance of having higher expectations for pupils – that go beyond simply learning what is in the curriculum – to create new knowledge. This includes sharing opinions, questioning the ways things have always been done, pursuing new questions and experimenting with different approaches. Their studies identify that pupils are already working with uncertainty, but mostly alone without the support of a teacher.
University of Sussex masters pupil, Mariyam Ahmed Toor, identifies the limits of current schooling for her generation. She said: “We don’t understand that it’s okay to feel uncertain and to not have answers all the time. In fact, somewhere along the way, we were taught in schools that uncertainty is bad which is so ironic because life is anything but certain. And so, instead of feeling liberated in our 20s, we feel overwhelmed and unsure because every move we make needs to be grounded in certainty.”
TRANSFORM-iN EDUCATION will bring together academic and non-academic stakeholders, especially teachers, parents, head teachers and students at schools and colleges, to promote more and better opportunities for different ways of experiencing knowledge in school. It’s founders hope to offer a forum to draw on the talents and expertise of teaching staff, who they say do not currently have the opportunities to step outside existing demands within schools.
The campaign will organise and attend events for researchers and teaching professionals to explore the balance of conformity and transformation in schooling, including the tensions in pursuing both goals.
Dr Kirby, an Associate in the School of Education and Social Work at the University of Sussex, said: “Our research has highlighted the need for the space to produce knowledge differently, what we call transformation. We need to listen to how teachers and students want to create spaces that are better suited to the rapidly changing context of the twenty-first century. This demands that we respond in ways not known or even imagined before, whilst not forgetting what we already know.”

Hundreds of UK teens honoured at national engineering awards – Education Today,"['Apprenticeships', 'Educational event', 'News', 'STEM']","December 10, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/hundreds-of-uk-teens-honoured-at-national-engineering-awards/,"Professor Alan Kwan, deputy head of school at Cardiff University, with scholars Lequesha Gonsalves and Robert White© 2018 Andrew Wiard
Almost 400 UK teens have been honoured by one of the UK’s leading engineering programmes.
Some 393 students – including a record-equalling 113 girls – achieved a coveted Arkwright Engineering Scholarship award as part of a drive to inspire future leaders in engineering.
The talented group, aged 16-17, were presented with their accolades at aerospace-themed ceremonies at the Institute of Engineering and Technology in London and the International Conference Centre in Edinburgh, supported by principal awards ceremony sponsors, the RAF.
Those honoured were handpicked from 1,600 hopefuls who applied for the scholarship in 2018 following a rigorous selection process, which assesses their academic, practical and leadership skills in engineering disciplines.
The awards were presented by RAF Group Captain Tony Keeling, Air Marshal Julian Young and Air Vice Marshal Ross Paterson.
Dr Kevin P Stenson, chief executive of the Smallpeice Trust, the UK’s leading national STEM education charity that runs the scholarships programme, said: “This year has seen an incredibly talented group of young people become scholars. We hope that this is the first step towards a successful and rewarding career in engineering.
“We are also immensely proud to see a large number of girls taking part in the programme. It is vital to the future of the UK engineering industry that we nurture these talented individuals to fulfil their potential as future leaders.”
Former scholar and STEM ambassador Khadijah Ismail, who gave presentations at the awards ceremonies, added: “Congratulations to all of the scholars who have made it this far. It is a wonderful achievement and thoroughly deserved.
“I loved every minute of my scholarship. It has opened a world of opportunities and possibilities to me. I now have a job as a degree apprentice aerospace engineer with BAE Systems. I have no doubt these young scholars have a very bright future ahead of them.
“It doesn’t matter who you are or your background, you can become anything you want to be if you are committed and work hard.”
Founded in 1991, the Arkwright Engineering Scholarships programme aims to identify, inspire and nurture future leaders in engineering. More than 150 organisations such as professional institutions, trade associations and schools support the programme.
Only the highest performing students from all educational backgrounds are selected following assessments including a two-hour aptitude exam and a university-based interview. Those who succeed receive academic and financial support during their studies.
As part of the scholarship, students gain access to a range of enrichment experiences such as conferences, Connect Days, mentoring, residential courses and university VIP days.
Since its inception, almost 5,400 young people have passed through the scholarship programme, including award-winning BBC presenter Steph McGovern, who forged a career at Black & Decker before moving into business journalism.

YHA named as Best Residential Experience provider for school trips – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'School Trips']","December 5, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/yha-named-as-best-residential-experience-provider-for-school-trips/,"YHA (England & Wales) has been named as the Best Residential Experience provider for school trips.
The leading youth charity scooped the accolade at the annual School Travel Awards 2018/19, the UK’s biggest event for school travel and learning outside the classroom.
Chosen by readers of School Travel Organiser magazine, the annual awards recognise the best venues, attractions and companies for educational visits.
Anita Kerwin-Nye, Director of Strategy and Engagement at YHA (England & Wales) said: “It’s an honour and a privilege to receive the award as it recognises the commitment and dedication of all YHA staff – both in hostel and behind the scenes, to delivering the very best experience for schools who choose to stay with us.”
Last year almost 100,000 primary and secondary school children stayed on school trips with YHA (England & Wales). The charity operates more than 150 youth hostels through England and Wales in cities, towns, coastal and National Park locations, with more than 80 of them Learning Outside the Classroom (LOtC) accredited; the most of any UK provider.
Research has shown that children from lower socio-economic groups, and those with special educational needs and disabilities are less likely to visit the countryside or undertake rural leisure pursuits.
YHA school trip activities at Castleton, Peak District, Derbyshire
To enable schools to provide the opportunity for outdoor travel and adventure to all their students, YHA’s Educational Breaks support programme supports young people aged between 8 and 18 who are eligible for Pupil Premium and have additional social challenges. Up to 10 young people in a group can apply for a two-night supported break at a Youth Hostel. The current round of applications to YHA’s Educational Breaks programme is open until 31st January 2019.
Anita added: “Giving young people the opportunity to learn and develop through travel and adventure is our passion and one of the main reasons that YHA exists. We know that travel and adventure are transformative for young people; benefitting their emotional, social and academic development.

New research leads the call to legally protect SENCOs’ time – Education Today,"['News', 'Research', 'SEND']","December 3, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-research-leads-the-call-to-legally-protect-sencos-time/,"New research has found that almost three-quarters of Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCOs) in the UK do not have enough time to sufficiently support pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND), leading to a widespread call to legalise the protection of SENCOs’ time.
That’s according to the National SENCO Workload Survey, conducted by Bath Spa University, nasen and the National Education Union (NEU), in order to understand the SENCO role in schools and in particular consider the impact that SENCO workload has on the professional and the school post-2014/15 SEND reforms.
An overwhelming majority (78%) of SENCOs stated that other roles or tasks within their teaching setting routinely pull them away from being able to carry out the SENCO role effectively, while only a quarter of respondents (26%) felt the role they were doing was manageable for one person.
The report has also found that SENCOs are working extra hours to fulfil the demands of the SENCO role, with 43% of primary SENCOs and 71% of secondary SENCOs working in excess of nine extra hours per week on SENCO duties – the equivalent of an additional full working day per week on top of any allocated SENCO time.
Despite 71% of respondents saying that they enjoyed their role as a SENCO most or all of the time, almost a third (30%) of SENCOs stated that they did not intend to be in the same role in five years’ time. Nearly half of those (49%) cited workload as the primary reason for wanting to leave the profession, whilst 45% cited a lack of government funding allocated to SEND support.
As such, almost all (95%) SENCOs surveyed believe they should have legally protected time to enable them to fulfil the demands of the role.
Dr Helen Curran, Senior Lecturer in Education: SEN at Bath Spa University, said: “‘The National SENCO Workload Survey has demonstrated how, in 2018, SENCOs are managing this challenging, yet rewarding, role. However, the survey has also illustrated how a lack of time to execute the role is not only affecting SENCOs, both professionally and personally, but is also impacting on children with SEND. SENCOs are seeking ways in which they can meet the demands of the role, often at a personal cost. Yet, this does not present a sustainable option for SENCOs or children alike. That this why, through the National SENCO Workload Survey, we are seeking protected time for the SENCO role.”
Dr Adam Boddison, Chief Executive at nasen added: “We were delighted to work on this joint project with Bath Spa University and NEU. The overwhelming response to the survey really demonstrates the dedication and commitment of SENCOs. It also highlights the critical importance of the role and why it matters to give them the capacity they need to perform the role effectively. This is an important step for SENCOs nationally,as we begin the discussion around the time SENCOs need to fulfil the demands of the role”.
Nansi Ellis, Assistant General Secretary, National Education Union, said: “It is clear from the survey findings that SENCO workload is becoming unmanageable and pupils with SEND are suffering for it. 95% of SENCOs told us that they need adequate protected time to carry out their role which means the Government must fund schools properly so that heads can provide it. The report also highlights the important role of teaching and learning support staff in enabling inclusion in schools.
“Government funding cuts are having a devastating effect as schools face the difficult decision of whether to make savings through redundancies or provide appropriate support for children with SEND. It is a choice they should not have to be making. SENCOs in the survey said they hate not being able to offer all the support they believe students need because of time pressures and funding constraints. It’s time for the Government to listen to the SEND experts.”
The National SENCO Workload Survey focused on how the SENCO role in schools was managed, specifically exploring the time and support SENCOs were able to access to enable them to effectively facilitate their role.More than 1,900 (1,903) SENCOs responded to the survey.
Eighty-five per cent of respondents reported that they work in a state funded, mainstream school in England. There are currently 20,202 state-funded schools in England, which indicates the survey was undertaken by eight per cent of SENCOs in the UK who currently work in state funded, mainstream primary or secondary schools in England.

Midlands maths teacher heads to China in Maths Hub exchange programme – Education Today,['News'],"November 29, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/midlands-maths-teacher-heads-to-china-in-maths-hub-exchange-programme/,"A Midlands teacher is hoping to help transform maths teaching in the region thanks to a fact finding trip to China.
Faye Glendinning, Strategic Leader for Maths at Birmingham’s Cedars Academy, will spend two weeks in Shanghai as part of the nationwide Maths Hub exchange programme between England and China, representing the Midlands as part of the scheme.
On her return to the UK, she will welcome counterparts from Shanghai to the Acocks Green based Cedars Academy, with more than 1,000 teachers from across the central region registering an interest to observe ‘showcase’ lessons taught by the Chinese teachers and ask questions about the teaching approach.
The Shanghai approach to the teaching of maths is based around a ‘mastery’ approach, achieved by children developing a deep, secure and fluent understanding of mathematical concepts and the ability to apply their knowledge to a variety of problems.
This whole-class approach ensures that no child is left behind. Misconceptions are addressed quickly and ‘slower graspers’ are supported with catch-up sessions to ensure everyone accesses the full curriculum at the same time.
The first part of the two-way trip will see Faye sit in on maths lessons at some of Shanghai’s leading schools before taking on the challenge of teaching a class herself.
Faye said: “It is an incredibly exciting opportunity for me to be heading off to China, I will be able to learn a lot from observing their methods and practices in person.
“At Cedars Academy we are constantly evaluating our educational practices in order to get the best from our pupils and looking at effective and successful approaches globally can only help that.
“China is renowned as a world leader in mathematics, so to be given access to classes in this particular part of the world is a real privilege.
“I am feeling a mixture of excitement and nerves, particularly with having to overcome the language barrier and teach maths to a class of children who speak Mandarin primarily, but from what I have been told I can expect to meet some very supportive and talented teachers.”
The exchange programme was initiated by the Department for Education in 2014 after a successful period for Shanghai students in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tables, where they regularly outperformed UK pupils.
Cedars Academy has been working with the Central Maths Hub and the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) for a number of years to develop its approach to maths teaching and learning.
Joe Purnell, Head Teacher at Cedars Academy, believes Faye’s visit will be beneficial not just to their children, but to others across the region.
He said: “For us it is a real privilege to be able to host the return visit, we are expecting that around 1,000 teachers will want to come and observe and ask questions at the ‘showcase’ lessons in January.
“I have visited China in the past and seen for myself their approach to education, it is a really eye opening and thought provoking experience.
“I’m sure Faye will pick up on some unique aspects of their teaching and learning culture and we can’t wait for her to share her thoughts on how we can use this trip to develop our approach to maths teaching further.”",a midland teacher is hoping to help transform math teaching in the region thanks to a fact finding trip to china faye glendinning strategic leader for math at birmingham cedar academy will spend two week in shanghai a part of the nationwide math hub exchange programme between england and china representing the midland a part of the scheme on her return to the uk she will welcome counterpart from shanghai to the acocks green based cedar academy with more than teacher from across the central region registering an interest to observe showcase lesson taught by the chinese teacher and ask question about the teaching approach the shanghai approach to the teaching of math is based around a mastery approach achieved by child developing a deep secure and fluent understanding of mathematical concept and the ability to apply their knowledge to a variety of problem this wholeclass approach ensures that no child is left behind misconception are addressed quickly and slower graspers are supported with catchup session to ensure everyone access the full curriculum at the same time the first part of the twoway trip will see faye sit in on math lesson at some of shanghai leading school before taking on the challenge of teaching a class herself faye said it is an incredibly exciting opportunity for me to be heading off to china i will be able to learn a lot from observing their method and practice in person at cedar academy we are constantly evaluating our educational practice in order to get the best from our pupil and looking at effective and successful approach globally can only help that china is renowned a a world leader in mathematics so to be given access to class in this particular part of the world is a real privilege i am feeling a mixture of excitement and nerve particularly with having to overcome the language barrier and teach math to a class of child who speak mandarin primarily but from what i have been told i can expect to meet some very supportive and talented teacher the exchange programme wa initiated by the department for education in after a successful period for shanghai student in the programme for international student assessment pisa table where they regularly outperformed uk pupil cedar academy ha been working with the central math hub and the national centre for excellence in the teaching of mathematics ncetm for a number of year to develop it approach to math teaching and learning joe purnell head teacher at cedar academy belief fayes visit will be beneficial not just to their child but to others across the region he said for u it is a real privilege to be able to host the return visit we are expecting that around teacher will want to come and observe and ask question at the showcase lesson in january i have visited china in the past and seen for myself their approach to education it is a really eye opening and thought provoking experience im sure faye will pick up on some unique aspect of their teaching and learning culture and we cant wait for her to share her thought on how we can use this trip to develop our approach to math teaching further,"['education', 'chinese', 'teach', 'class', 'mathematical', 'china', 'teaching', 'mathematics', 'math', 'teacher']"
Schools to take over Tate Liverpool – Education Today,"['Alternative curriculum', 'Art & Craft', 'Community engagement', 'Educational event', 'News']","November 27, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/schools-to-take-over-tate-liverpool/,"Edge Hill University and Tate Liverpool are to deliver a ground-breaking educational programme that uses iconic artworks in new ways. From spring 2019 the institutions will begin their Schools in Residence programme. Hosted in Tate Liverpool’s art display Ideas Depot it invites children, staff, and students from City Region schools to use the gallery as a learning resource where they will spend a week in residence and their curriculum will be delivered using exhibited artwork as a way of teaching core subjects.
Ideas Depot features artists such as Salvador Dali, Mona Hatoum, Henri Matisse, and Chris Ofili. It is a colourful and inviting space showing iconic paintings, sculptures, and photographs from the Tate collection of modern and contemporary art. The display has been designed by architect Sam Jacob to resemble the ways artworks might be stored, usually behind the scenes.
In anticipation of each residency – with one taking place per term – the pupils and their teacher will visit behind the scenes at Tate Liverpool’s to see and select the works they would like to have on display during their residency.
The display has been developed in parallel with the initial phases of research Edge Hill University Faculty of Education is undertaking with Tate Liverpool and this innovative education and community project aims to inform gallery learning approaches. The project aims to explore new ways for schools to enhance and enrich teaching and learning, and for teachers, children and their families to enjoy and develop a sense of ‘ownership’ of museum and gallery spaces.
The Schools in Residence programme is the product of many months of work and pilot projects. The first phase saw 150 eight to nine year-old-children participate in workshops with Tate Liverpool artist educator Harriett Hall, programme manager, Dr Deborah Riding and Edge Hill’s Dr Helen O’Keeffe, Nichola Grimshaw and Cait Talbot Landers. Phase two involved classes from LIPA Primary School take up residency in the gallery for two weeks, experiencing their planned curriculum as usual, but delivered using many different spaces as their classroom. Students and staff from Edge Hill, Tate Liverpool and the schools involved reflected on their experiences at the end of each day and the information gathered has helped develop the model for the future Schools in Residence Programme.
Dr Helen O’Keeffe, Associate Dean of Edge Hill’s Faculty of Education, said: “Ideas Depot is an exciting and innovative display which it is hoped will support teachers, children and their families to connect with new and different artworks, seeing how they link to their own lives and school curriculum. The residencies are being developed as a response to the external funding pressures on arts subjects in the curriculum and this helps us to explore a sustainable model where arts learning is embedded into planning. We want teachers to feel confident in using the gallery independently and in creative ways in their teaching.”
Dr Deborah Riding, Programme Manager, Children and Young People, Tate Liverpool added: “Ideas Depot is a very special display at Tate Liverpool that inspires primary aged children to make connections between artworks, their imaginations, and the curriculum. The display also demonstrates the power of collaboration and the exchange of ideas and knowledge. In partnership with Edge Hill we will work with and welcome primary schools from across the region, giving them a space to learn in new and exciting ways.”

"NSPCC’s ‘Speak Out. Stay Safe’ programme reaches 20,000 schools – Education Today","['Digital skills', 'News', 'Online safety', 'Support materials']","November 26, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/nspccs-speak-out-stay-safe-programme-reaches-20000-schools/,"An NSPCC programme that teaches children how to keep themselves safe from abuse has reached 20,000 primary schools across the UK.
Widney Junior School in Solihull became the 20,000th school to be visited by the charity’s ‘Speak Out. Stay Safe’ service.
‘Speak Out. Stay Safe’ consists of an assembly presentation for children aged five to 11, and a one-hour classroom workshop for children in years five and six.
With the help of NSPCC mascot Buddy, the interactive assemblies and workshops help children recognise the different types of abuse, and understand how to protect themselves.
They also learn where they can turn for help – including the NSPCC-run service Childline.
It comes as latest figures reveal 2,494 child sex offences were recorded by West Midlands Police last year, and nearly 65,000 across England and Wales.
In the 2017/18 school year, more than 25,000 pupils at 82 schools in Birmingham and Solihull were reached by ‘Speak Out. Stay Safe’.
But NSPCC Schools Service volunteers and staff are visiting schools across the UK every week.
NSPCC Schools Service Area Co-ordinator for Birmingham, Tracey Hulston, said: “’Speak Out. Stay Safe’ is spreading an important message in a lively, interactive and memorable way, while also helping children feel empowered to talk to a trusted adult or Childline.
“We are delighted to have reached so many children across the UK, but we will keep visiting schools every week to ensure this vital service helps to protect a generation of pupils from abuse.”
Widney Junior School Deputy Headteacher, Marie Kitching, said: “Not only have our pupils really enjoyed today’s assembly, they have learned so much, and it is clear that it has made a lasting impression on them.
“Educating children about the risks of abuse, and how to keep themselves safe, is a crucial part of their development – and ‘Speak Out. Stay Safe’ does this brilliantly.”
The NSPCC Schools Service relies on volunteers to help deliver assemblies and workshops.

ENGAGE is an online virtual social learning and presentation platform which provides a platform for creating, sharing and delivering proprietary and third-party VR content for educational and corporate training purposes.
Through ENGAGE, students can build virtual worlds and scenes that create simulated life experiences. In addition to school environments, the creators envisage that ENGAGE driven training videos and modules will aid business, law enforcement and emergency medical services in everything from suicide prevention to simulations for communicating with patients of dementia. The power of the platform is that students not only build the virtual scenario, but they star as role players in the experience.
CEO David Whelan spoke of their dedication to transforming the delivery methods of education and corporate training by utilising VR technologies to deliver fully immersive virtual learning experiences,
“It is a powerful virtual reality collaboration and creation tool. It allows educators to host meetings, classes, private tutorials, training sessions and presentations with people from all over the world participating in a safe, virtual, multi-user environment.
It is designed as a complementary tool to enhance classroom teaching, or as a standalone tool providing distance learners with access and opportunities to connect at a collegial level with their fellow students.  
Our ENGAGE platform aims to fully immerse the user into their learning experience, in order to increase learning retention and engagement. It will allow people to receive the best education, from the best educators from around the world, all from the comfort of their own home using virtual reality.”",irish virtualaugmented reality vrar software firm immersive vr education ivre will showcase it latest offering to the virtual reality education market by exhibiting it engage platform at the upcoming school and academy show at the nec in birmingham on november this daylong event is firmly established a one of the largest education expo in the uk a it can influence the outcome of learner through the use of technology ceo david whelan along with mike boyce and chris long will be on hand during the event to demonstrate engage at stand b they will show attendee how engage can be used by educator to immerse learner in any content those in attendance will also be able to participate in a highoctane vr educational experience speaking ahead of their attendance ceo david whelan of ivre said we are delighted to have been asked partake in the event to demonstrate our engage platform the school and academy show is a fantastic opportunity and space for u to showcase our latest offering to all type of school we are particularly excited to be part of this event a it give u a chance to see some of the innovative creation being produced by our peer in the education industry mike boyce of ivre said they expect interest to be strong throughout the day and they are ready willing and able to engage with anyone who visit their stand one of the best part of this event is the opportunity for u to meet people and give them the opportunity to experience our work for themselves and learn about the technology we see so much application for vr technology in training and education and we are excited to talk to people and hear their thought on the industry and the potential within it the school and academy show the school and academy show provides a national platform twice yearly to discus idea learn bestpractice and test product and service with the aim of improving teaching and learning outcome to drive the uk education sector forward over visitor from across the sector have attended the school and academy show since it launch and benefit from insight and product offered by the sector leading supplier the birmingham event will have over exhibitor speaker and over attendee are expected mike boyce went on to say this is a key event in the calendar to meet supplier innovator and policymakers within the uk education system it the perfect place to be for u right at the heart of educational development and discovery the engage platform engage is an online virtual social learning and presentation platform which provides a platform for creating sharing and delivering proprietary and thirdparty vr content for educational and corporate training purpose through engage student can build virtual world and scene that create simulated life experience in addition to school environment the creator envisage that engage driven training video and module will aid business law enforcement and emergency medical service in everything from suicide prevention to simulation for communicating with patient of dementia the power of the platform is that student not only build the virtual scenario but they star a role player in the experience ceo david whelan spoke of their dedication to transforming the delivery method of education and corporate training by utilising vr technology to deliver fully immersive virtual learning experience it is a powerful virtual reality collaboration and creation tool it allows educator to host meeting class private tutorial training session and presentation with people from all over the world participating in a safe virtual multiuser environment it is designed a a complementary tool to enhance classroom teaching or a a standalone tool providing distance learner with access and opportunity to connect at a collegial level with their fellow student our engage platform aim to fully immerse the user into their learning experience in order to increase learning retention and engagement it will allow people to receive the best education from the best educator from around the world all from the comfort of their own home using virtual reality,"['yearly', 'bestpractice', 'exhibitor', 'virtualaugmented', 'online', 'classroom', 'innovator', 'expo', 'tutorial', 'ceo']"

What teachers need to know about retirement planning – Education Today,"['News', 'Pensions', 'Personal finance']","November 14, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/what-teachers-need-to-know-about-retirement-planning/,"Tracy Isaac
Tracy Isaac, Business Development Manager at Wesleyan, talks about pension shortfalls and offers advice on how teachers can prepare for retirement.
You don’t have to be on the verge of retirement to start planning for it. In fact, the sooner you familiarise yourself with your options, the more relaxed you’ll feel about the whole process. And hopefully you’ll be better placed to make the right decisions about an important phase in your life.
It is a complex issue, so to try to help avoid confusion, here we look at what you need to consider ensuring you’re not left short in retirement.
Contracting out
Until April 2016 the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS) and Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) automatically contracted members out of the Additional State Pension – allowing both employer and employee to pay lower national insurance contributions (NICs). The State Pension and Additional State Pension have now been replaced by the new flat rate State Pension.
Only those with 35 years of qualifying NICs will be entitled to the full flat rate pension (currently £164.35 per week). You will need to make sure you know whether you qualify so that you can make accurate calculations about your retirement income. If you have been ‘contracted out’, this will also be taken into account when the rate is calculated.
Someone who was contracted out will still have received qualifying years of NICs for each of the years they were earning. However, as they have paid a reduced rate of NICs, this will be taken into account when working out their new single tier pension starting amount.
This is why there can be some confusion. It can look as if you are not receiving the ‘full’ state pension, but in practice the ‘missing’ amount is made up in the benefits from your contracted out pension. This is known as COPE (Contracted Out Pension Equivalent), and when added to your reduced starting amount of state pension, it is broadly equivalent to the full starting amount.
It is important to ensure you have amassed enough qualifying years. If you are unsure, you can check your National Insurance record at www.gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record to see if there are any gaps. You may then be able to apply for credits to fill these gaps.
Topping up
If it looks like you won’t have the required 35 qualifying years by the time you retire, don’t worry, there are still steps you can take.
Depending when the gap occurred it may be possible for you to make voluntary NI contributions to fill gaps in your National Insurance record. An additional year’s NI contribution can be bought for roughly £760, which could increase an annual pension income by more than £245 a year. Over the course of 20 years, this could be worth as much as £4,900.
Buying five year’s contributions for a little less than £4,000 could potentially benefit a retiree with an additional £24,500 of pension income over 20 years. However, additional contributions can’t be made if you have achieved 35 years’ service or if you are on track to reach this number of years.
While the initial cost may put some people off, in the long term it can help you achieve your retirement goal, and is still good value when compared to buying a private pension to help you close the gap.
Planning ahead
On average, teachers think they need an income of £25,056* a year to live comfortably, but government figures show the average income of all pensioners is only £15,964** a year. But addressing your pension shortfall early can help to close this gap.
As we continue to live longer, it’s important that the money we have lasts us. Many people are now living for 30 years or more after retiring, therefore it’s vital that your money and assets can last as long as you do.
While monthly expenditures tend to decrease during retirement – mortgages are usually paid off and children have normally left home – it’s important to factor in that private care may be needed further down the line. As older generations live longer, many retired people are also finding they need to contribute towards the care costs of their parents.
If you’re unsure, get advice
State pensions can be confusing, and any changes to the system only adds to their complexity.
To make sure teachers are well informed about their retirement future, Wesleyan is holding seminars across the UK, where our Wesleyan Financial Services Consultants will be on hand to explain the changes, answer questions, and offer advice.
Speaking to a Financial Consultant whose expertise lies within the teaching profession will ensure that you can make the right choices when it comes to retirement, maximising your assets and making sure that you can live comfortably.

"Budget cuts reduce schools’ ability to tackle bullying, says NAHT – Education Today","['Bullying', 'Funding', 'News', 'Unions']","November 13, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/budget-cuts-reduce-schools-ability-to-tackle-bullying-says-naht/,"Official statistics released yesterday (Monday 12 Nov) show that one in six young people between 10 and 15 years old reported being bullied.
Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT said: “The government’s cuts to school budgets are bad news for children who are being bullied.
“School staff are the first line of defence against bullying and they are the best way of making sure it doesn’t happen in the first place. But NAHT’s research into school budgets shows that more than a third of schools (37%) have had to reduce the number or hours of teaching staff.
“Teaching assistants and pastoral staff in schools also play a vital role in managing behaviour, but more than four fifths (86%) of school leaders have reduced the hours or numbers of support staff because of the cuts. Almost two thirds (65%) of the NAHT members who responded to our survey said that they strongly agreed these reductions have resulted in a negative impact on their school.
“Of particular concern to us is the fact that pupils with additional needs and from lower incomes are the once most likely to report that they are being bullied. But efforts to step in, so that every child has an equal chance to succeed, are being hampered by the cuts to budgets.
“Pupils thrive when they have a great environment to learn in. That environment is created by the skilled professionals employed by the school. Many of these professionals are having their hours cut because school budgets are at breaking point, and there’s no sign of any extra money coming from the Treasury, which is a disaster for young people who are feeling bullied at school.”",official statistic released yesterday monday nov show that one in six young people between and year old reported being bullied paul whiteman general secretary of school leader union naht said the government cut to school budget are bad news for child who are being bullied school staff are the first line of defence against bullying and they are the best way of making sure it doesnt happen in the first place but nahts research into school budget show that more than a third of school have had to reduce the number or hour of teaching staff teaching assistant and pastoral staff in school also play a vital role in managing behaviour but more than four fifth of school leader have reduced the hour or number of support staff because of the cut almost two third of the naht member who responded to our survey said that they strongly agreed these reduction have resulted in a negative impact on their school of particular concern to u is the fact that pupil with additional need and from lower income are the once most likely to report that they are being bullied but effort to step in so that every child ha an equal chance to succeed are being hampered by the cut to budget pupil thrive when they have a great environment to learn in that environment is created by the skilled professional employed by the school many of these professional are having their hour cut because school budget are at breaking point and there no sign of any extra money coming from the treasury which is a disaster for young people who are feeling bullied at school,"['breaking', 'school', 'teaching', 'budget', 'bad', 'disaster', 'yesterday', 'bullied', 'monday', 'bullying']"
"Gresham’s raises £8,000 for new WWI memorial to feature names of 15 students and staff discovered during four year centenary project – Education Today","['History', 'News', 'Remembrance', 'World War One']","November 9, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/greshams-raises-8000-for-new-wwi-memorial-to-feature-names-of-15-students-and-staff-discovered-during-four-year-centenary-project/,"In 1918 Gresham’s headmaster George Howson announced that the newly built school Chapel would be furnished with a memorial to the students and staff who died fighting in WWI: a stained glass window designed by Reginald Otto Bell; and the names of the fallen carved and gilded into a six-panel memorial board. 100 years later, Gresham’s has raised £8,000 for a new memorial stone, which includes the names of 15 students and staff who were omitted from the original memorial.
Simon Kinder, Gresham’s Head of History who has been involved in the project, explains: “The names were omitted either as a result of having only been discovered more recently, thanks to further research, or as a result of the students and staff members having moved away to other schools and institutions and therefore being included on memorials elsewhere. Some of the missing names were initially discovered by our former Deputy Head, Sue Smart, who published a poignant book about the fallen – When Heroes Die – in 2001. The book, which was reprinted in 2014, gives our school a connection with our past that few other schools are likely to have, and for that we are incredibly grateful to Sue.
“Building on Sue’s findings, I undertook further research, comparing our original school registers with the CWGC database, newspaper archives and family history and military online resources,steered by our school archivist Liz Larby. Committed to the philosophy that archives need to be educationally relevant, Liz has supported every aspect of our wider centenary project since 2014, including leading a group of student researchers every Friday afternoon in the task of creating profiles of the fallen men, all of which can be found in the Roll of Honour section of our dedicated WWI Memorial Website.”
The combination of staff and student efforts has resulted in the school discovering 15 names – the original memorial board depicted 99 students and one member of staff and the school now knows the names of 112 students and three members of staff – which will be included on the new memorial board. The largest donation towards the £8,000 needed for the new stone was given by the Gresham’s Foundation, with further support received from the Old Greshamiam Club and wider school community. A special effort was made by former Director of Music at Gresham’s, Angela Dugdale, for organising a WWI concert, 1914-1918 Never Such Innocence, Gresham’s at War in words and music. Proceeds from the concert, alongside £10 sales of a CD recorded in the school’s Fishmongers’ Recital Room by Robert FitzGerald, with tenor Christopher Barnes and pianoforte Philip Adam titled We do not forget, were donated to the memorial stone fund.
Gresham’s Headmaster, Douglas Robb, said: “In a service held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Chapel, in 2016, we remembered that the building stands as a memorial to those from the school community whose lives began here but were tragically cut short by war. The Roll of Honour of the 115 fallen students and staff was read out and, for each name, a member of the school’s current Combined Cadet Force solemnly left the building. The empty seats portrayed a haunting image to those present. As part of our four year focus on the centenary, we have paused and remembered each one of our fallen, as close as we can to the centenary of their death, with specially commissioned paper lanterns lit as a symbol of Hope and Peace, and 115 stories told since the project began in 2014.
“The City of Peace stained glass window bears the inscription “They whom this window commemorates were numbered among those who, at the call of King and Country, left all that was dear to them, endured hardness, faced danger and finally passed out of the sight of men by the path of duty and sacrifice, giving up their lives that others may live in freedom. Let those who come after see to it that their names be not forgotten.” I am so thankful to our students, to Simon and Liz, to Sue, and everyone else who has supported this project. It gives all of us such a tangible way to mark the centenary of the end of the Great War, as well as a renewed determination to play our part in maintaining peace.”",in gresham headmaster george howson announced that the newly built school chapel would be furnished with a memorial to the student and staff who died fighting in wwi a stained glass window designed by reginald otto bell and the name of the fallen carved and gilded into a sixpanel memorial board year later gresham ha raised for a new memorial stone which includes the name of student and staff who were omitted from the original memorial simon kinder gresham head of history who ha been involved in the project explains the name were omitted either a a result of having only been discovered more recently thanks to further research or a a result of the student and staff member having moved away to other school and institution and therefore being included on memorial elsewhere some of the missing name were initially discovered by our former deputy head sue smart who published a poignant book about the fallen when hero die in the book which wa reprinted in give our school a connection with our past that few other school are likely to have and for that we are incredibly grateful to sue building on sue finding i undertook further research comparing our original school register with the cwgc database newspaper archive and family history and military online resourcessteered by our school archivist liz larby committed to the philosophy that archive need to be educationally relevant liz ha supported every aspect of our wider centenary project since including leading a group of student researcher every friday afternoon in the task of creating profile of the fallen men all of which can be found in the roll of honour section of our dedicated wwi memorial website the combination of staff and student effort ha resulted in the school discovering name the original memorial board depicted student and one member of staff and the school now know the name of student and three member of staff which will be included on the new memorial board the largest donation towards the needed for the new stone wa given by the gresham foundation with further support received from the old greshamiam club and wider school community a special effort wa made by former director of music at gresham angela dugdale for organising a wwi concert never such innocence gresham at war in word and music proceeds from the concert alongside sale of a cd recorded in the school fishmonger recital room by robert fitzgerald with tenor christopher barnes and pianoforte philip adam titled we do not forget were donated to the memorial stone fund gresham headmaster douglas robb said in a service held to commemorate the th anniversary of the opening of the chapel in we remembered that the building stand a a memorial to those from the school community whose life began here but were tragically cut short by war the roll of honour of the fallen student and staff wa read out and for each name a member of the school current combined cadet force solemnly left the building the empty seat portrayed a haunting image to those present a part of our four year focus on the centenary we have paused and remembered each one of our fallen a close a we can to the centenary of their death with specially commissioned paper lantern lit a a symbol of hope and peace and story told since the project began in the city of peace stained glass window bear the inscription they whom this window commemorates were numbered among those who at the call of king and country left all that wa dear to them endured hardness faced danger and finally passed out of the sight of men by the path of duty and sacrifice giving up their life that others may live in freedom let those who come after see to it that their name be not forgotten i am so thankful to our student to simon and liz to sue and everyone else who ha supported this project it give all of u such a tangible way to mark the centenary of the end of the great war a well a a renewed determination to play our part in maintaining peace,"['concert', 'death', 'robb', 'died', 'archivist', 'chapel', 'pianoforte', 'recital', 'fishmonger', 'headmaster']"
Donmar Warehouse’s all-female Shakespeare Trilogy added to the National Theatre’s On Demand In Schools service – Education Today,"['Drama', 'English', 'News', 'PSHE', 'School Trips']","November 7, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/donmar-warehouses-all-female-shakespeare-trilogy-added-to-the-national-theatres-on-demand-in-schools-service/,"Clare Dunne (Prince Hal) and Jade Anouka (Hotspur) in Henry IV – Photo by Helen Maybanks
Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, the ground-breaking trilogy which includes Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest is now available for secondary schools to watch across the UK via the free national service. With a diverse, all-female cast and set in a women’s prison, the productions asked the question, “Who owns Shakespeare?”. The Trilogy was described by the Observer as ‘One of the most important theatrical events of the last 20 years.’
The Donmar Shakespeare Trilogy began in 2012 with an all-female production of Julius Caesar with Harriet Walter in the title role. Two further productions followed: Henry IV in 2014 and The Tempest in 2016, all featuring a diverse company of women.
The National Theatre’s On Demand In Schools service offers world class curriculum-linked productions – free of charge – to schools across the country. Over 3880 schools are currently signed up to the service, including over 60% of state-funded secondary schools in the country. There are 14 productions available on the service which includes four titles suitable for primary schools.
On Demand In Schools complements trips to see live performances by enabling younger audiences to watch plays in their classroom. The plays are recorded in high definition in front of a live theatre audience. Teachers can show the full production or choose to watch key scenes over a number of lessons.
To accompany the Shakespeare Trilogy recordings, the Donmar Warehouse has created extensive digital learning resources that have been developed in partnership with the Trilogy company, teachers and young people. Designed to support the teaching of Drama, English and PSHE, the accessible resources support in giving further context to the development of the Shakespeare Trilogy, and explorations of its key themes and contemporary relevance to young people.

Howzat! Coventry schoolchildren get sporty at cricket masterclass and tournament – Education Today,"['News', 'Sport & Play', 'Wellbeing']","November 5, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/howzat-coventry-schoolchildren-get-sporty-at-cricket-masterclass-and-tournament/,"Schools from the Romero Catholic Academy came together to welcome the Warwickshire Cricket Board (WCB) to an afternoon of cricket at Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School.
Teams of 15 from each primary school in the academy, which includes Corpus Christi, Good Shepherd, Sacred Heart, St Gregory’s, St John Fisher, St Patrick’s and Ss Peter and Paul Catholic Primary Schools, took part in a coaching session with WCB.
Pupils then enjoyed a round-robin tournament led by the sports leaders at Cardinal Wiseman School, who refereed and umpired the games.
It was the children from St Patrick’s Primary School who were triumphant in the tournament, and were each presented with a medal to mark their achievement.
The event not only gave the primary school children an opportunity to learn new skills, but also gave them a taster of secondary school life.
WCB cricket coaches are now due to work with Year 4 and 5 pupils across all seven Romero primary schools during the spring term as part of the Chance to Shine cricket programme, which looks to encourage more young people to take up the sport.
Rhye Parry, PE and Wellbeing Co-ordinator at the Romero Catholic Academy, said: “The event was an excellent way to bring primary school children from across the Academy together to enjoy an afternoon of cricket.

Leading hotels offer career guidance to Edge Hotel School students amid concerns over skills shortfall – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News']","November 1, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/leading-hotels-offer-career-guidance-to-edge-hotel-school-students-amid-concerns-over-skills-shortfall/,"Top hotels from across the country were on hand to offer advice to students starting their hospitality careers as concerns mount over the growing skills shortage facing the industry.
The Careers Fair was organised by the University of Essex’s Edge Hotel School at their Colchester Campus where 32 prestigious hotels including The Ritz London, Shangri-La Hotel At The Shard and Claridge’s spoke with students about graduate opportunities.
Industry leaders offered advice on the variety of opportunities available to graduates hoping to work in hospitality and events, as well as sharing tipson interview techniques, guidance for landing a top job and explaining more about the excitement of working in a fast paced, people focussed industry.
Recent research has shown that just 22% of 16-21 years olds in the UK would consider a career in hospitality despite it being the 4th largest industry in the UK.
“Hospitality is a great industry to be involved in,” said Laura Winstone, Talent & Development Manager at the Shangri-La Hotel At The Shard. “There are roles to suit everyone, anywhere in the world and a passion and enthusiasm can lead to great rewards. It was fantastic to see the industry coming together and sharing their advice and experience with young students at the start of their journey.”
Natasha Thakker, Assistant Human Resources Manager at The Ritz London, added: “The industry is going through significant change at the moment and there are some concerns about the number of people entering the profession. However, life in hospitality is often misunderstood and there are so many opportunities available. We regularly welcome students to the Ritz so they can gain practical experience which gives them a real boost and helps them land the top jobs.”
Andy Boer, head of department at Edge Hotel School said: “Currently young people aren’t aware of just how vibrant and exciting a career in hospitality can be. There’s a perception that it’s all about making beds or waiting tables. But it’s much more than that. It can lead to a whole variety of roles that span design, revenue management, finance,talent development, law and marketing. It involves real business acumen.”
Mandy Hu, a Hotel Management student who attended the Careers Fair, commented: “Whilst the academic side of my course has given me a really good understanding of what it’s like working in the hospitality industry, I’ve found that the first thing potential employers ask about is practical, on the job experience. Working in the on-campus hotel as part of my course has been a real boost and it was encouraging speaking with some of the most well known hotels about the prospects available after I graduate.”

Cambridge Assessment English celebrates 30 years of CELTA by honouring the English language teaching community – Education Today,"['Assessment', 'Educational event', 'News']","October 29, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/cambridge-assessment-english-celebrates-30-years-of-celta-by-honouring-the-english-language-teaching-community/,"English language teaching tutors and trainees took part in a series of birthday parties this month, as Cambridge Assessment English celebrated the 30th birthday of its industry leading CELTA qualification.
To show its appreciation to everyone who has championed the CELTA qualification over the past 30 years, Cambridge Assessment English provided CELTA centres with a ‘Birthday in a Box’ party kit. More than 45 CELTA centres hosted parties for their CELTA staff, alumni and current CELTA trainees.
Established in September 1988 by Cambridge Assessment English, CELTA is a qualification for teachers of English as a foreign language. Based on an intensive four-week course, or more extended part-time study, it combines theoretical study with assessed practical teaching experience. CELTA courses are available at over 300 approved centres in more than 70 countries.
Blandine Bastie, Country Head (UK and Ireland), Cambridge Assessment English, says: “Over the past 30 years CELTA has become very highly regarded across the globe, and this is thanks to our dedicated tutors who teach the qualification year after year, and the bright trainees who use their CELTA qualification to teach English as a foreign language all over the world. We wanted to take this opportunity to celebrate with our centres. From London to Dublin to Malta, the birthday parties truly represent the strong international reputation that CELTA upholds.”
David Riddell, a CELTA trainer at International House London, the renowned language school that played the leading role in the development of the qualification that became CELTA, said: “I have been teaching on CELTA courses for 30 years, and on every course I do it is inspiring to see our trainees develop their teaching skills as they progress through the course. Whether they use the qualification to seek work as an English language teacher in the UK, or go off to teach in other countries, it is always incredibly rewarding to see trainees go on to apply what they have learnt on their CELTA course to the benefit of English-language learners around the world. Through the 30th birthday party, Cambridge Assessment English has given us the opportunity to bring our community together and celebrate with current staff, trainees, students and alumni. We all look forward to the next 30 years of CELTA!”
CELTA is highly regarded internationally and, according to recent research which looked at requirements for English language teaching (ELT) jobs around the world, CELTA is the qualification most often requested by employers. The study revealed that CELTA is requested by 71.5 percent of ELT employers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, compared to just 23.6 percent asking for CELTA’s nearest equivalent the Trinity CertTESOL. The data from the study further revealed that, in the UK, 88 percent of jobs that require an ELT qualification specifically ask for a CELTA qualification.",english language teaching tutor and trainee took part in a series of birthday party this month a cambridge assessment english celebrated the th birthday of it industry leading celta qualification to show it appreciation to everyone who ha championed the celta qualification over the past year cambridge assessment english provided celta centre with a birthday in a box party kit more than celta centre hosted party for their celta staff alumnus and current celta trainee established in september by cambridge assessment english celta is a qualification for teacher of english a a foreign language based on an intensive fourweek course or more extended parttime study it combine theoretical study with assessed practical teaching experience celta course are available at over approved centre in more than country blandine bastie country head uk and ireland cambridge assessment english say over the past year celta ha become very highly regarded across the globe and this is thanks to our dedicated tutor who teach the qualification year after year and the bright trainee who use their celta qualification to teach english a a foreign language all over the world we wanted to take this opportunity to celebrate with our centre from london to dublin to malta the birthday party truly represent the strong international reputation that celta upholds david riddell a celta trainer at international house london the renowned language school that played the leading role in the development of the qualification that became celta said i have been teaching on celta course for year and on every course i do it is inspiring to see our trainee develop their teaching skill a they progress through the course whether they use the qualification to seek work a an english language teacher in the uk or go off to teach in other country it is always incredibly rewarding to see trainee go on to apply what they have learnt on their celta course to the benefit of englishlanguage learner around the world through the th birthday party cambridge assessment english ha given u the opportunity to bring our community together and celebrate with current staff trainee student and alumnus we all look forward to the next year of celta celta is highly regarded internationally and according to recent research which looked at requirement for english language teaching elt job around the world celta is the qualification most often requested by employer the study revealed that celta is requested by percent of elt employer in europe the middle east and africa compared to just percent asking for celtas nearest equivalent the trinity certtesol the data from the study further revealed that in the uk percent of job that require an elt qualification specifically ask for a celta qualification,"['alumnus', 'englishlanguage', 'month', 'teacher', 'celebrate', 'cambridge', 'fourweek', 'tutor', 'party', 'birthday']"
New Teacher Training Centre unveiled in Guilsborough – Education Today,"['Academies', 'News', 'Training']","October 25, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-teacher-training-centre-unveiled-in-guilsborough/,"A new Teacher Training Centre has been opened by Chris Heaton-Harris MP at Guilsborough Academy which aims to address the national shortage of teachers.
The building, which is located at the front of Guilsborough Academy, was created by converting an old caretaker’s house on the premises. The training centre now houses several training rooms and a kitchen.
The project is the brain child of the Principal, Julie Swales, who was appointed two years ago, and will be supported by the Grand Union Training Partnership (GUTP), which facilitates a Teacher Training Centre at Sponne School in Towcester, and the teacher training partnership at Ashlawn School in Rugby. It will also work closely with local universities including Leicester, Bedford, Northampton and Warwick. Six trainee teachers have already enrolled to start at the centre in September and the team plans to support a further two teachers in its pilot year. If the pilot year goes well, there are plans to extend the centre and provide a training solution for teachers at secondary schools across the county in its second year.
Beth Nunley, Assistant Principal at Guilsborough Academy and Teacher Training Lead, will be running the centre on a day-to-day basis. She said: “We have been aware of a decline in the number of new teachers coming through into the profession in recent years, which is resulting in a national teacher shortage as older teachers reach retirement. Although here at Guilsborough Academy we are fully staffed with an excellent workforce, at a local level we are seeing a shortage of teachers in Maths, Physics and Computer Science in particular and we wanted to do something proactive to address this.
“Our motto at Guilsborough Academy is ‘learning without limits’, this doesn’t just apply to our students it also applies to our staff. We hope the new Teacher Training Centre will put Guilsborough Academy on the map when it comes to producing high quality teachers who want to train and work in a range of secondary subject areas. We also want to develop our training programmes for Newly Qualified Teachers, Recently Qualified Teachers and experienced teachers through a range of courses and continued professional development opportunities, so they can thrive within their profession.”
Chris Heaton-Harris, MP for the Daventry District, officially declared the centre open by cutting a ribbon. He said: “I was delighted to open the new Teacher Training Centre at the Guilsborough Academy. It was a real pleasure to meet staff at the Academy and fantastic to see the new facility. I know the centre will provide high quality training to teachers and will be a real asset to the Academy, offering a huge range of courses and opportunities.”
The Teacher Training Centre and Guilsborough Academy are situated in the village of Guilsborough, Northants which falls under the Daventry district and is just over six miles from Junction 18 of the M1 between Northampton, Rugby and Leicester.

"New inquiry: how are schools in Wales funded, and is it enough? – Education Today","['Funding', 'News', 'Policy']","October 19, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-inquiry-how-are-schools-in-wales-funded-and-is-it-enough/,"A new inquiry is underway to look at how Welsh schools are funded and whether it’s enough to meet their needs.
The issue of school funding has come up as a theme in a number of recent enquiries and the National Assembly’s Children, Young People and Education Committee feel now is the time to take a wholesale look at this fundamental issue.
The Committee will be looking at the relationship and balance between the various sources of funding to schools, as well as how transparent these relationships are. This will predominantly include schools’ core budgets but will also look at specific funding streams such as the Pupil Development Grant (PDG), which is used to improve outcomes for learners eligible for free school meals (eFSM) and Looked After Children (LAC).
The inquiry will look at the sufficiency of provision for school budgets, in the context of other public service budgets and available resources, and amongst the inquiry’s other areas of focus will be the weighting given to education and school budgets specifically within the local government settlement formula and the process which local authorities then follow to set each school’s budget.
“Responding to concerns we have heard in other inquiries, this Committee will be looking closely at how Welsh schools are funded, where that funding comes from and whether it is enough to meet the needs of our schoolchildren,” said Lynne Neagle AM, Chair of the Children, Young People and Education Committee.
“We will be looking at whether the current level of provision for school budgets either complements or inhibits the delivery of the Welsh Government’s policy objectives.However, we are well aware of the current spending climate and the need to balance the needs of schools against the demands of other public services.
Our inquiry is therefore not just about the sufficiency of school funding but the way in which individual schools’ budgets are determined and allocated.”

MP goes back to school to inspire pupils to aim high – Education Today,"['Careers', 'Charity', 'News', 'Primary schools']","October 15, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/mp-goes-back-to-school-to-inspire-pupils-to-aim-high/,"A Conservative MP has returned to school in Kirkby to help broaden primary pupils’ jobs horizons and boost their career aspirations for their future.
Gillian Keegan, who grew up in Knowsley and is now MP for Chichester, visited Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Primary School in Moorfield, Tower Hill, Kirkby, to share her journey from a local girl to Westminster with Year 6 students and to discuss the pupils’ jobs aspirations and how they might achieve them.
She returned under the innovative programme run by the education charity Future First which is helping primary schools in Knowlsey establish communities of alumni and supporters who can share their experiences of the working world with current pupils.
The programme is the first of its kind in the country to work with primary schools in this way. It builds on Future First’s successful work in more than a thousand secondary schools and colleges across Britain and will help primary schools harness the time, talent and resource of their former students and local community supporters to show pupils the world of opportunities available to them after they leave school.
Sheila Murphy, Deputy Headteacher, said, ‘Our children loved the workshops and activities led by Future First staff. They were extremely lucky to have inspirational role models who returned to school to work alongside them in the workshops. They empowered the children to broaden their horizons in terms of careers they would like to pursue in the future and also gave them wonderful insights into the world of work. Their confidence and self-esteem improved as a result of the Future First Project and school leaders are keen to build upon its success.’
Future First Chief Executive Matt Lent said, ‘It’s hard for young children to understand the connection between their school studies and the world of work. Our work in secondary schools has already shown that former students and local supporters are the perfect relatable role models, having an enormous positive influence on the confidence and motivation of young people.

Be relaxed about building services design – Education Today,['News'],"October 12, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/be-relaxed-about-building-services-design/,"Much of the complexity of designing, installing and maintaining central heating in multi-occupancy low-rise buildings can potentially now be eliminated with a room-by-room solution from Gilberts that combines ventilation with heat boost.
The concept means that there is no need to provide radiators in the rooms in which the new option is fitted. Further, because the solution is fitted at ceiling height, it liberates interior design and optimises use of floor space.
The solution focuses around Gilberts’ unique Mistrale Fusion (MFS) unit with an integrated LPHW coil. Just 2 x standard MFS128, or 1 x MFS256, will warm a standard 32 pupil-classroom to all regulatory requirements.
The stand-alone unit is installed as normal through the building façade. The core MFS appliance provides natural ventilation and uniquely blends the incoming fresh air with the warmth from the exhaust air without the need for a heat exchanger.
MFS ensures an even distribution of airflow, with control over temperature and CO2 levels within, and maintains a comfortable internal environment for occupants.

The Trust, which consists of Ranelagh Primary School in Stratford, Curwen Primary and Nursery School in Plaistow and Kensington Primary School in Manor Park, now boasts a range of new awards for its innovation and achievements in the fields of professional development, religious education, promoting citizenship and sport.
One Trust school, Ranelagh Primary School based in Stratford, has been awarded the Religious Education Quality Mark. The REQM recognises high quality RE, particularly those schools which are providing their learners with authentic experiences and contributing to whole school outcomes.
The award reflects the commitment the school is demonstrating to diversity.
The Trust has also seen success in the form of the Achievement for All Quality Mark, which was awarded to Kensington Primary School as a result of its efforts to create an “inclusive and nurturing environment for children to grow and develop into exceptional citizens”.
In the feedback Kensington School received when awarded the Mark, judges said: “The school’s values provide aspirational expectations for all children and define the culture in which children learn. There is a strong sense of community with children and staff having clear empathy for one another.”
As well as the individual school awards, Tapscott Learning Trust’s own independent Training Hub has scooped the Professional Development Quality Mark.
This achievement celebrates the Training Hub’s efforts to champion continuous professional development among its staff through nationally recognised programmes as well as bespoke training tailored for particular school needs.
Over the summer break, it was also confirmed that both Ranelagh and Kensington were awarded the School Games Gold Kitemark and that Curwen Primary School maintained its Platinum Kitemark.
The School Games Mark is a government-led awards scheme launched in 2012 to reward schools for their commitment to the development of competition across their school and into the community.
Focusing on participation, competition, workforce and clubs within the local area, the Trust has “excelled” in the sporting arena over the last year.
“We are very proud of every school within our Trust, and to everyone who contributes to our success as a Trust,” said Paul Harris, CEO of the Tapscott Learning Trust. “National recognition like this shows that we’re achieving some real success in so many areas of the work we do, and these awards round off what has been a stellar year for the Trust and our schools.”",the tapscott learning trust in newham is celebrating after it partner school scooped a raft of major national award the trust which consists of ranelagh primary school in stratford curwen primary and nursery school in plaistow and kensington primary school in manor park now boast a range of new award for it innovation and achievement in the field of professional development religious education promoting citizenship and sport one trust school ranelagh primary school based in stratford ha been awarded the religious education quality mark the reqm recognises high quality re particularly those school which are providing their learner with authentic experience and contributing to whole school outcome the award reflects the commitment the school is demonstrating to diversity the trust ha also seen success in the form of the achievement for all quality mark which wa awarded to kensington primary school a a result of it effort to create an inclusive and nurturing environment for child to grow and develop into exceptional citizen in the feedback kensington school received when awarded the mark judge said the school value provide aspirational expectation for all child and define the culture in which child learn there is a strong sense of community with child and staff having clear empathy for one another a well a the individual school award tapscott learning trust own independent training hub ha scooped the professional development quality mark this achievement celebrates the training hub effort to champion continuous professional development among it staff through nationally recognised programme a well a bespoke training tailored for particular school need over the summer break it wa also confirmed that both ranelagh and kensington were awarded the school game gold kitemark and that curwen primary school maintained it platinum kitemark the school game mark is a governmentled award scheme launched in to reward school for their commitment to the development of competition across their school and into the community focusing on participation competition workforce and club within the local area the trust ha excelled in the sporting arena over the last year we are very proud of every school within our trust and to everyone who contributes to our success a a trust said paul harris ceo of the tapscott learning trust national recognition like this show that were achieving some real success in so many area of the work we do and these award round off what ha been a stellar year for the trust and our school,"['achievement', 'innovation', 'education', 'success', 'proud', 'stellar', 'celebrates', 'champion', 'celebrating', 'platinum']"
Global Learning Partnerships launches applications for 2019 cohort – Education Today,"['Appointments', 'Careers', 'News']","October 3, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/global-learning-partnerships-launches-applications-for-2019-cohort/,"A programme which offers a unique, immersive and life-changing personal and professional development opportunity is accepting applications for its 2019 intake.
Global Learning Partnerships (GLP) has challenged and empowered 86 Scotland-based educators with an authentic learning experience increasing confidence, resilience and resourcefulness.
More than 20 practitioners will be invited to join the GLP network in 2019. GLP, which is managed and majority-funded by The Wood Foundation, includes a month spent in Rwanda or Uganda and several interventions pre- and post-travel to realise as part of the full development potential.
Jill Callander, a probation mentor at Aberdeenshire Council, was part of the first GLP cohort in 2012 and returned in 2018 as a Team Lead. “GLP is the best CLPL activity I have experienced in my career and has had the biggest impact on both my professional and home lives.
“It differs from traditional CLPL in that it is sustained over a longer period of time than most learning activities. It is not completed in isolation or with a small group. It immediately opens you to opportunities to build team work and collaboration with colleagues from across primary and secondary as well as other educational sectors in order to share skills, knowledge and experience and build support and challenge across the team.”
GLP works in partnership with ethical local organisations IEE Rwanda and Redearth Education to build the capacity of education professionals within host countries. Through community-based placements,GLP facilitates the sharing of knowledge, ideas and best practice to support improvements in teaching and learning within a local context. Jill added: “Key to the success of GLP is the focus on considering sustainable impacts on local education practices as well as impact back in the UK. We were working hard to add value to an ongoing programme of development, not air dropping support in and then leaving.”
GLP Programme Manager Georgea Hughes said: “Meaningful global education is essential for the prosperity of our planet. There has never been a greater need to develop young people’s understanding of their responsibility to actively contribute towards a more equitable and sustainable world.”
Applications and more information are available at www.glpscotland.org.uk. The application period is active from now until 11th January 2019.

International Baccalaureate students address global challenges in honour of programme’s 50th anniversary – Education Today,"['Alternative curriculum', 'Educational event', 'News']","October 2, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/international-baccalaureate-students-address-global-challenges-in-honour-of-programmes-50th-anniversary/,"In honour of the International Baccalaureate’s (IB) 50th anniversary this year, students from 153 countries, studying all four IB programmes came together and developed projects in an effort to tackle real-world problems in extraordinary ways. The initiative, coined #generationIB, gives students a platform to showcase their collaborative skills, innovative ideas and solutions to a global audience.
Students participated in the assignment unequivocally, refurbishing fragmented coastal habitats, offering research and solutions to health issues impacting local communities, and much more. Notable examples among the more than 300 submissions include:
• Students in India distributed medicine to parts of the country where access is limited.
• Maunalua Bay, Hawaii students worked together to protect and maintain endangered reefs.
• Students in Bosnia conducted research to defend their peers against fake news and misinformation campaigns.
“The idea of celebrating the 50th anniversary this way is great.” said Dzeneta Ajanic, a mathematics teacher at Druga Gimnazija Sarajevo, one of the IB World Schools in Bosnia. “The topics IB offered to students are so inspiring and applicable globally. It is our pleasure to work on this project.”
Notable IB alumni were asked to suggest challenges the world is currently facing, for students to tackle under the five themes: health, citizenship, education, environment and equality, all of which are at the core of many of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.
Dr Siva Kumari, Director General of the IB, said: “We want to show the world that IB students of all ages are equipped with creativity and skills in working together, and are utilising these talents to find solutions to some of society’s most pressing issues. The #generationIB projects showcase the sort of creative thinking, collaborative skills and intellectually curious approaches that mark an IB education.”
Celebrating on the global stage
This week, the IB will partner with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and theGlobal Schools Program Projects to showcase some of the #generationIB solutions to more than 1,500 participants from within and outside the IB community at the IB Global Conference in Vienna, taking place 4-6 October. The conference is designed to bring together educators, government ministers and academia, to celebrate and learn more about the IB’s education across the globe.
Director of the UN’s SDSN, Jeffrey Sachs, had this to say about IB’s global impact: “It’s one thing to announce a goal, it’s another thing to achieve it, and that’s where we need the IB to come in, and young people.” said Sachs. “[some of] these governments…are not really focused on the public good, so they have said “OK, we support these goals,” but they’re not necessarily working hard to achieve them.”
50 years of international education
50 years ago, the IB developed a movement for international education to bring young people together with the skills, values, and knowledge necessary to build a more peaceful future. Today, IB students and graduates in almost 5,000 schools in 153 countries employ their learning to make a real impact in communities, locally and globally.",in honour of the international baccalaureate ib th anniversary this year student from country studying all four ib programme came together and developed project in an effort to tackle realworld problem in extraordinary way the initiative coined generationib give student a platform to showcase their collaborative skill innovative idea and solution to a global audience student participated in the assignment unequivocally refurbishing fragmented coastal habitat offering research and solution to health issue impacting local community and much more notable example among the more than submission include student in india distributed medicine to part of the country where access is limited maunalua bay hawaii student worked together to protect and maintain endangered reef student in bosnia conducted research to defend their peer against fake news and misinformation campaign the idea of celebrating the th anniversary this way is great said dzeneta ajanic a mathematics teacher at druga gimnazija sarajevo one of the ib world school in bosnia the topic ib offered to student are so inspiring and applicable globally it is our pleasure to work on this project notable ib alumnus were asked to suggest challenge the world is currently facing for student to tackle under the five theme health citizenship education environment and equality all of which are at the core of many of the un sustainable development goal dr siva kumari director general of the ib said we want to show the world that ib student of all age are equipped with creativity and skill in working together and are utilising these talent to find solution to some of society most pressing issue the generationib project showcase the sort of creative thinking collaborative skill and intellectually curious approach that mark an ib education celebrating on the global stage this week the ib will partner with the united nation sustainable development solution network sdsn and theglobal school program project to showcase some of the generationib solution to more than participant from within and outside the ib community at the ib global conference in vienna taking place october the conference is designed to bring together educator government minister and academia to celebrate and learn more about the ibs education across the globe director of the un sdsn jeffrey sachs had this to say about ibs global impact it one thing to announce a goal it another thing to achieve it and thats where we need the ib to come in and young people said sachs some of these governments…are not really focused on the public good so they have said ok we support these goal but theyre not necessarily working hard to achieve them year of international education year ago the ib developed a movement for international education to bring young people together with the skill value and knowledge necessary to build a more peaceful future today ib student and graduate in almost school in country employ their learning to make a real impact in community locally and globally,"['alumnus', 'celebrating', 'refurbishing', 'medicine', 'educator', 'student', 'teacher', 'anniversary', 'graduate', 'hawaii']"
Leading the way – Future Teaching Scholars celebrate the future of maths and science teaching – Education Today,"['Careers', 'Grants', 'News', 'STEM', 'Training']","October 1, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/leading-the-way-future-teaching-scholars-celebrate-the-future-of-maths-and-science-teaching/,"On 6 and 7 September, a major conference held in Nottingham hosted some of the brightest Maths and Physics students from English universities as part of an annual celebration of future teaching talent. The students, who were all part of the Future Teaching Scholars programme, were spotted as some of the most talented and are now being supported through their time at university to become the much-needed teachers of tomorrow.
The DfE has targeted recruiting teachers in priority subjects, including Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM), by offering bursaries of and scholarships to those entering the teaching profession. The Future Teaching Scholars programme works to address this by identifying exceptional A level students studying Maths and Physics and supporting them through a six-year programme into teaching in England.
Funded by the Department for Education, and run by Education Development Trust, scholars benefit from a £15,000 grant whilst they study Maths or Physics at university. Scholars also benefit from in-school experiences and training and support from Regional Training Centres such as Bishop Challoner Catholic College in Birmingham. The Future Teaching Scholars programme ultimately ensures that more children learn from confident, knowledgeable and highly skilled teachers with a passion for STEM subjects.
Toby Simpson from Lincoln, who is studying Maths at Birmingham University, said: “Teaching was always an interest of mine, and the programme seemed pretty dynamic. I was sold on doing a maths degree and becoming a teacher. Being a scholar and student at the same time really enhances the university experience. It’s just so different to the rest of the maths teaching. It teaches you independence to do something that makes a difference.”
Scholars attended a two-day gathering in Nottingham, bringing together future teachers from across the country to learn the crucial skills needed to become highly skilled quality teachers, such as how to make Mathematics more engaging, conflict resolution and how to manage behaviour in the classroom.
Emily Giubertoni from the Bishop Challoner Regional Training Centre in Birmingham, who also ran a popular behaviour management and conflict resolution session at the conference,said: “Future Teaching Scholars programme participants are particularly unique. Most of them start age 18 or 19 and so have real energy. It’s really inspirational to see the journey they go through – moving from shaking for five minutes when they start, right through to leading a Maths or Science class at the age of 20. The programme is amazingly rich for people who are teaching as well, they can share their expertise and their experience. At Bishop Challoner, we’ve used it as a tool for teachers to develop themselves and go beyond the classroom.”

Learn2Think Foundation launches news writing competition for 8-11 year olds – Education Today,"['Competition', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Research', 'Skills']","September 27, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/learn2think-foundation-launches-news-writing-competition-for-8-11-year-olds/,"Charitable company The Learn2Think Foundation is offering young students the chance to develop their writing, as well as critical thinking, reasoning and research skills in the 2018 Learn2Think Young Journalist Prize.
The focus this year is on questioning, challenging 8-11 year olds to think like an investigative journalist, using interviewing to get the heart of a story. The winner will receive a laptop.
The Foundation is asking children for an article about a subject that really matters to them, demonstrating the use of their own ‘voice’; sound reasoning; interviewing skills and thorough research.
Last year’s entries were about subjects such as the importance of playing outside and lollipop ladies, sexism and the peace protests in Spain. “It was wonderful to read such enthusiastic, original and thoughtful pieces of writing. Children clearly relished the opportunity to participate in something ‘real world’, and as a homework project it got whole classes inspired,” says Virginia McLean, one of the founders of Learn2Think.
One mother said of the competition, “Thank you for having such an engaging competition – it can be challenging to develop opportunities for young people to have a voice and engage in thought-provoking writing.”
Pupils aged between 8-9 or 10-11 can submit an article of up to 300 or 500 words, or a podcast. Just e-mail it with their name, age and school to info@learn2think.org.uk by November 2nd 2018. Winners will be announced on the UN International Day for Tolerance, 16th November.
Judges include Channel 4 news producer Lizzy Amanpour and CEO of SAPERE, Amelia Foster.
The Foundation has also offered some tips to get the budding journalists started:
• Find an interesting person to talk to, and make sure you find out all you can about them before you talk to them.
• An interview relies on good quality questioning so plan your questions in advance and make sure they are relevant and challenging.
• Avoid questions with only a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, that are complicated to understand, that contain incorrect facts, or are too personal (it’s not that important to the story what their favourite colour is).

Let’s Play provides everything that teachers need to create an outstanding piece of theatre and inspire creative learning across the curriculum.
Schools signed up to the programme can send up to four teachers on a theatre making course led by professional theatre artists and get access to specially commissioned scripts,musical scores and backing tracks for original songs as well as curriculum-linked teaching resources for Key Stage 1 and 2. Schools can choose from a selection of plays including some that are perfect for the celebrating end of the autumn term, including The Snow Queen and Operation Christmas.
Children taking part will be able to get involved with all aspects of planning and creating a theatre production – from performing to designing costumes to operating sound.Let’s Play offers the whole school community the chance to celebrate the creation of a school play and the achievements of all involved. The National Theatre is aiming to recruit hundreds of schools across the UK to take part in Let’s Play over the next three years.
Danae Gardner, a teacher at Harris Academy East Dulwich, who took part in Let’s Play last year said, “Taking part in Let’s Play has really brought the school community together and opened everyone’s eyes to why taking part in high quality drama projects like this is important, and really worthwhile. Our teacher’s confidence in their ability to stage big professional performances has gone through the roof, the children have realised their potential and are more excited than ever about drama”.
Lisa Burger, Executive Director at the National Theatre said, “The school play is a very special moment in every child’s school experience and Let’s Play has been developed to support teachers across the UK with the resources, skills and confidence to create an outstanding piece of theatre with their pupils.

Sign up for Outdoor Classroom Day and get children outside to play and learn – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'Primary schools', 'Sport & Play', 'Wellbeing']","September 20, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/sign-up-for-outdoor-classroom-day-and-get-children-outside-to-play-and-learn/,"A national education charity is calling on schools around the country to swap their desks for the outdoors on Thursday 1 November.
Outdoor Classroom Day is returning this November – and this time promises to be bigger and better than ever before. Following a record 2,612 schools and nearly 350,000 children taking part across the UK and Republic of Ireland (ROI) in May, schools are being challenged once more to take lessons outdoors and prioritise playtime.
The international initiative, led in the UK and ROI by national school grounds and education charity Learning through Landscapes and globally by Project Dirt, acts as a catalyst to inspire more time outdoors on a daily basis: both at school and at home. Its long-term aims include for children to have access to 90 minutes of playtime at school every day.
Speaking of November’s campaign, Carley Sefton – CEO of Learning through Landscapes – said: “We are proud to continue leading the Outdoor Classroom Day campaign in the UK and ROI; it’s an initiative that we know is critical not only to the health and wellbeing of children and young people, but also to their cognitive development.
“It’s proven that outdoor learning and play increases social skills, imagination, engagement with learning, concentration and behaviour. We know that 90% of teachers who got involved in 2017 said that children were more engaged in their learning and 72% said that they were better able to concentrate after learning outdoors. As mental health challenges rise and pressures on children and young people increase, it becomes more and more vital that we harness these easy-to-achieve benefits.
“Between our 2017 campaign and May 2018, one fifth of teachers in the UK and ROI told us they had increased time for outdoor play since taking part in the campaign, with two fifths increasing outdoor learning time. We know the initiative has the power to change pupils’ school life.
“We are excited about our November day as it reinforces our core belief that there’s no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing.We believe that children should be outdoors all year round as it is highly beneficial to their health and wellbeing.”
This November’s campaign will centre on the benefit of risky play and learning in school grounds and outdoor spaces, focussing on the impact an individual’s actions can have on our environment.
Cath Prisk, Global Partnerships Director at Project Dirt, said: “We wanted to use this Outdoor Classroom Day to show that risky learning and play is a crucial part of growing up.
“Dirty knees and scratched elbows are not something children should fear – they should stand as a foundation to teach them about their strengths and limitations.
“Courageous play not only enables children to learn about challenging situations – and how to rise to them – but also how to be more aware of others.
“We also believe that it can help children understand how their actions can decrease or increase risk to the environment; a crucial learning tool to bring into young people’s lives. We want to use this as an opportunity to connect children to the environment and encourage them to nurture the nature around them.”
Although some schools are on half term on 1 November, the campaign still invites them to register and simply go outdoors on a day that suits them. Parents and supporters can also sign up to show their support and to get more information about how they can help make outdoor play and learning part of every day for every child.

University of Hertfordshire announces collaboration to boost the quality of science in primary schools – Education Today,"['News', 'Primary schools', 'Science']","September 18, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/university-of-hertfordshire-announces-collaboration-to-boost-the-quality-of-science-in-primary-schools/,"The University of Hertfordshire has announced the launch of a pioneering collaboration with the Primary Science Teaching Trust (PSTT) to support the delivery and development of the Primary Science Quality Mark (PSQM). Professor Ian Campbell, Deputy Vice-Chancellor at the University and Professor Dudley Shallcross, CEO of PSTT, formally confirmed the agreement at the 2018 PSQM Conference, held on 13 – 14 September.
The PSQM, instigated and developed by the University, is already a highly successful, unique award programme which raises the profile and quality of science in primary schools across the UK and beyond. It provides teachers with a framework and professional support for developing science leadership, teaching and learning in their schools.
Jane Turner, Associate Professor and PSQM Director, School of Education at the University of Hertfordshire, said: “The increased focus on English and maths in primary schools have had a detrimental effect on the quality and amount of science teaching and learning in primary schools. As a result, primary teachers have limited access to science Continued Professional Development opportunities.
“Feedback from teachers who have completed the programme, reveal that the PSQM framework has greatly helped them with their forward planning and developing established practices. Our collaboration with the PSTT will enable us to reach more primary schools to further raise the profile of science and provide local support.”
Currently 15% of primary schools in England have a PSQM. According to a report by Wellcome Trust Primary Science Campaign, 90% of teachers in schools with PSQM 4 or currently applying for it, received support compared with 68% of teachers in schools who do not hold the award.

Active IQ launches Level 4 Diploma in Primary Physical Education Practice – Education Today,"['Assessment', 'Exams', 'News', 'Sport & Play', 'Wellbeing']","September 17, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/active-iq-launches-level-4-diploma-in-primary-physical-education-practice/,"Active IQ – the UK’s leading Ofqual-recognised Awarding Organisation for the Active Leisure, Learning and Wellbeing Sector – is launching a Level 4 Diploma in Primary Physical Education Practice. Developed in partnership with Sporting Futures Training, the diploma is aimed at teaching assistants, learners who have completed a physical education apprenticeship in a school setting and staff already supporting physical education in schools.
All learners must hold a Level 3 qualification in Supporting Teaching and Learning or Supporting Physical Education in Schools (or equivalent) and a qualification in safeguarding prior to studying the diploma. The purpose of this qualification is to provide learners with the knowledge and skills to be able to contribute to the planning, delivery and development of schemes of work in primary physical education.
The Active IQ Level 4 Diploma in Primary Physical Education Practice links to National Standards and is on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF). The guided learning time is approximately 585 hours and the total qualification time including theoretical and practical assessments is around 730 hours. Learners will be placed with a school for an academic year for a minimum of 30 hours a week for 38 weeks during which time they will enjoy on and off-the-job training, supervised teaching and shadowing/mentoring by a qualified teacher.
Progression from this qualification could be to a higher-level teaching assistant, foundation degrees in teaching and learning, sport science, physical education and school sport and primary education.
“Physical activity among children is an absolute priority with rising levels of obesity and inactivity threatening the health of today’s youngsters and future generations,” says Lee Buck, Active IQ Head of Product Development.
“Key to children’s activity levels is the physical education they enjoy at school. Our Diploma aims to bring a high level of skill, understanding, confidence and enthusiasm to teaching and support staff to boost the time and scope of activity offered within primary schools. As a nation, we need to prioritise children’s health and wellbeing: upskilling staff in primary physical activity will really help drive provision and raise standards,” says Lee.
“This new Diploma is far reaching and rich in content to enable learners to have a full understanding of the national curriculum for primary physical education and explore creative ways to engage young children in physical activity,” says Jo Pountney, Director at Sporting Futures Training. “As an advanced level diploma, we are looking to promote sustainable high-quality primary physical education programmes and give learners the skills and confidence to engage with children, parents and school staff. By understanding the full context of physical activity in schools, appreciating inclusivity and managing any special education needs children may have, this Diploma can really enhance the physical activity provision at primary level.”

In collaboration with Scholastic UK Book Clubs, Patterson’s Big Book Giveaway will make over £25,000 available to schools and teachers in both the autumn and spring terms of this school year.
100 schools will receive funds of £250 each term to spend on books via Scholastic’s Book Club. Scholastic will top up each £250 donation with 25% in extra ‘rewards’ to enhance the amount of free
books that schools are able to buy.
Both Patterson and Scholastic are committed to helping schools and teachers make reading for pleasure and access to books a priority. Analysis from school responses to Scholastic’s Reading Audit survey shows that although 87% of schools have a library, 77% have less than the recommended minimum number of books for their roll size and 88% of schools replace less than 10% of their book stock per
year.
The Scholastic network of Book Club teachers are invited to apply for one of the grants at www.scholastic.co.uk/jamespattersongiveaway and spread the word and their passion for school libraries amongst their colleagues using #bigbookgiveaway. Schools must register on the website and say why their school deserves the grant. Applications must be submitted by 31st October 2018 and winning recipients will be selected by Scholastic and James Patterson.
James said: “Libraries are at the heart of every school, and I’m thrilled to be partnering with Scholastic to continue to underscore both the need to sustain them, and the vital role that school libraries, librarians and teachers play in transforming lives and fostering a love for learning. I can’t underscore enough how important books and reading are to a child’s development – better readers make better people and ultimately better citizens.”
Catherine Bell, Scholastic Co Group MD said: “We know from our own research that over 83% of schools have reading on their School Improvement Programme but access to enough books to ensure children have choice remains a perennial problem. School libraries are such an important way of giving every child access to the best books to help them develop literacy skills and a love of reading for pleasure.

There But Not There and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission launch new First World War education resources – Education Today,"['History', 'KS2', 'KS3', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Resources', 'Secondary schools', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","September 12, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/there-but-not-there-and-the-commonwealth-war-graves-commission-launch-new-first-world-war-education-resources/,"There But Not There, the First World War centenary campaign led by former Chief of the General Staff, General The Lord Dannatt, has launched a new series of educational resources to assist teaching today’s generation about one of the defining periods of the UK’s history.
Developed in partnership with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), the range of resources will give pupils the opportunity to reflect on the impact of the First World War and to discover why remembrance has become a vital part of national life.
Available to those aged 7 to 14, materials consist of lesson plans, worksheets and presentations, designed to educate about the level of sacrifice made by British and Commonwealth men and women in the First World War.
The education resources will encourage the pupils to investigate the many backgrounds and experiences of the men, women and children who lived through the conflict.
Created for groups covering Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 curricula in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the resources aim to challenge pupils to distinguish between methods of historical enquiry, make connections, draw contrasts and frame historically valid questions, while creating a wider knowledge of the First World War and how it affected communities across the UK and the Commonwealth.
There But Not There Patron, Lord Dannatt said: “One of the key pillars of the There But Not There campaign is to educate. We believe it is vitally important that the generation of today are not only aware of the sacrifices made by so many men and woman during the First World War, but develop a strong understanding of the momentous effect it had on both the UK and the international community.
He continued: “These educational resources, made possible by the fantastic expertise and knowledge at the CWGC, will play a key role in ensuring that the children are well positioned to learn about one of the most important periods of this country’s history.”
Commonwealth War Graves Commission Director of Information and Communications, Liz Woodfield said: “Over the last 100 years the CWGC has helped to define the way in which the UK remembers the sacrifice of its Commonwealth forcesin both World Wars. These learning resources will enable teachers and students to learn more about the incredible work undertaken and the scale of the loss. They also provide an opportunity for young people to discuss how the decisions made, such as equality of treatment of the dead, were arrived at and to consider if we would reach the same decisions today.”

North’s leading art college becomes The Northern School of Art – Education Today,"['Art & Craft', 'FE colleges', 'News']","September 10, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/norths-leading-art-college-becomes-the-northern-school-of-art/,"Cleveland College of Art and Design (CCAD) is now officially The Northern School of Art.
The new name recognises the school’s pre-eminence as the leading provider of specialist creative art and design education in the North and one of the best in the UK.
It follows hot on the heels of figures in the 2018 National Student Survey (NSS) that rank The Northern School of Art as the best amongst similar arts institutions for student satisfaction.
The School was one of only two north eastern institutions awarded Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) Gold for full time undergraduate teaching in 2017 the first time the TEF was published,which is now reflected in its new identity.
The name change is the result of a rigorous statutory process and required detailed scrutiny and final approval by the Secretary of State for Education.
Dr Martin Raby, Principal, The Northern School of Art, said: “We embarked on the very long and detailed process in order to have a name that reflects our status as one of the few remaining specialist art schools in the country and the leading provider of creative education in the North across both further and higher education.
“Our prestigious new identity as The Northern School of Art also celebrates what we’ve achieved over the past 140 years with our proud heritage dating back to 1874 in Hartlepool and the 1860s in Middlesbrough and signals the huge ambition we have for the future as we continue to nurture the next generation of creative professionals, businesses and entrepreneurs.
“In addition, as the use of Cleveland as a county name ended in 1996, the name of Cleveland College of Art & Design has long since lost its relevance to potential students, so we view the change to become The Northern School of Art as a really positive vote of confidence in the Tees Valley, celebrating the strength and quality of teaching we offer to support the region’s burgeoning creative industries.”
The move to become The Northern School of Art is set against a backdrop of growth in the creative and cultural sector in the North East which grew in value by 47% between 2010 and 2016, an increase only beaten by the London region and Scotland.
Nationally the creative and cultural sector is worth £81 billion to the country each year and is the third largest sector in the economy (DCMS, 2017), employing over 4 million people which represents 1 in 11 people in the UK workforce.
Dr Raby added: “The creative and cultural sector is thriving regionally and nationally and official government figures show that it has been growing for decades, at nearly twice the average UK rate between 2010 and 2016. It is estimated that by 2022 the sector will need 900,000 highly skilled graduates and supporting and supplying that need is squarely where our vision lies.”
For the past for years at least 96% of the school’s graduates have been in employment or further studies six months after they graduated, placing it amongst the best performing in the country for any subject.

NAHT responds to Public Accounts Committee report on Ofsted – Education Today,"['News', 'OFSTED', 'Unions']","September 7, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/naht-responds-to-public-accounts-committee-report-on-ofsted/,"Responding to the Public Accounts Committee’s report on Ofsted, Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, and chair of the commission on school accountability, said: “With around £44m spent annually on school inspection, it is right that the Public Accounts Committee should continue to focus on value for money and the reliability of Ofsted judgements.
“School leaders expect to be held to account. Children only get one chance at an education and it is absolutely right that arrangements are in place to monitor quality and to take action where problems exist – quite frankly, the stakes are simply too high not to. But accountability systems should always be tested against their ability to improve standards. In the 25 years since Ofsted were formed they have helped transform educational standards in this country. Now, the vast majority of schools are good or better. This changed landscape demands a different approach if Ofsted are to continue to be a force for improvement in education.

Primary schools urged to sign up for NSPCC ‘Speak out. Stay safe.’ visit to keep children safe from harm – Education Today,"['Charity', 'KS1', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Social issues', 'Support materials']","September 6, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/primary-schools-urged-to-sign-up-for-nspcc-speak-out-stay-safe-visit-to-keep-children-safe-from-harm/,"Primary schools across the country yet to receive an NSPCC ‘Speak out. Stay safe.’ assembly are being urged to sign-up for a visit. Delivered at no cost to schools, the programme could prevent pupils suffering from abuse or neglect.
Since 2011 the children’s charity has been to almost 80% of UK primary schools, with specially trained NSPCC staff and volunteers delivering vital child protection messages in a fun and age appropriate way. One in five children has suffered some form of abuse or neglect and the ‘Speak out. Stay safe.’ programme has been designed to encourage children to seek help if they feel at risk or in danger. The service is front and centre of a new national ad campaign launching this week, with millions of TV viewers being given a taste of its potentially life changing work.
In 2017/18 alone the NSPCC’s School Service visited over 8,000 primary schools and spoke to around 1.8 million children in locations ranging from Cornwall to the Isle of Orkney in Scotland.

As well as assemblies and workshops, the charity also offers specialist resources, lesson plans and training to help embed the learning in the weeks after their visit. Vera Jajechnyk, Head of School and Safeguarding Lead at St John’s Catholic School in Kent said: “Before the NSPCC came to our school they sent over a lot of information and were very organised. Everything was really clear and straightforward. The session gave children clear ideas of where they could go for help and advice in a straightforward way. They make it really child friendly.”
The ‘Speak out. Stay safe.’ programme links directly to the curriculum, helping schools meet their statutory safeguarding requirements.
The assemblies are held for children aged 5-11, followed by a one-hour classroom workshop for years 5/6 (England and Wales) and P6/7 (Scotland and Northern Ireland).
Assemblies can be delivered bilingually in Wales, and an adapted version of the programme is available for children with special education needs.
Karen Squillino, Head of the NSPCC Schools Service, added: “We are proud of our ‘Speak out. Stay safe.’ programme and believe it can make a massive difference to the lives of the primary school children we see all across the UK. We are really keen to hear from the 20% of primary schools that have yet to receive a visit from our team and set up a date for us to come and speak to their pupils.”

How To Choose The Right Outdoor Classroom and Shelter Solution for Your School – Education Today,['News'],"September 5, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/how-to-choose-the-right-outdoor-classroom-and-shelter-solution-for-your-school/,"The term “outdoor classroom” has almost now become a generic, synonymous term for an outdoor learning programme within a school environment but nowadays, the actual product itself has taken on a new meaning as it is embraces so many different applications.
These different and diverse applications warrant therefore a different kind of product with the outdoor classroom family and we will describe below as to exactly what is required for each need or requirement.
Shelter
In the majority of cases, a school will simply want to provide for some kind of shelter or shade in the playground as protection against the elements – be that sun or rain. These type of outdoor shelters typically are constructed of a roof system with supporting legs and in certain cases, either full length roll-down canvas panels or solid timber infill panels to afford that extra bit of protection from the weather. The shelters we offer at the Hideout House Company have a variety of roofs a school can choose from and these are namely high quality grade PU coated canvas, felt shingle tiles or cedar shingle tiles. These shelters are available in either octagonal, square or rectangular shape formats.
Outdoor Classroom
These are defined as the popular and classic open-sided gazebo style outdoor classrooms which are used for either shade and shelter (as listed above) or more typically as a building to be used by a school class for outdoor learning. The most popular shape is octagonal as it is easier to teach from a position at the front but again they are also available in either square or rectangular formats. They can also be used as parent waiting shelters.
With regards to sizes, a 5m octagonal classroom will be used to accommodate a class of 30 children whereas a smaller one at 4m will cater for 22 children. Building wise, you can then add in various options such as solid infill wall panels, toughened glass or polycarbonate windows, access ramp, opening and closing upper louvre panels, roll-down canvas panels and door, atrium roof to allow in lots of natural light from above, trellis panels, 50% anti-slip grip decking, built in bench storage units, inter post desks and seats and even totally enclose it with glass and French doors. We can even put in two tier amphitheatre-style seating.
Then we have various eco options such as a roof guttering and water butt system (for rainwater harvesting), living sedum roof, educational wind turbine, solar panel, energy monitoring board with two power sockets which the children can use to power up laptops, visualisers etc, electricity producing dynamo bikes which the children pedal to create power, planters and bird boxes – see link below for further details on these.
http://www.hideouthouse.com/portfolio-item/interesting-optional-extras/
Enclosed Outdoor Classrooms
These buildings are, as the name suggests, fully enclosed so that they can be used all year round and in all weathers. They are used in instances where a school wants 365 days usage and can also used as outdoor libraries, break-out nurture rooms for special one to one pupil tuition, community rooms or even as temporary classroom buildings.
A school has the option to fully insulate them and in the majority of cases, they fall under 30m2 as building regulation approval does not have to be sought for buildings of this size. The rectangular and square options can also feature bi-fold doors to the front elevation so that one side can be fully opened up to allow for a natural free-flow from outdoors to inside and vice versa.
An interesting addition to this range is our outdoor classroom pod which is a pre-manufactured unit which comes delivered pre-assembled on the back of a low loader truck and is then either towed or craned into position. It has an attractive large circular Hobbit-style door and a round window on the back wall to add a bit of extra creative flair. A school has the option to have it fully insulated and with an electrics pack including lighting and heating.
Fire Pit Shelters
The forest school programme is becoming increasingly popular and one of the key skills children learn is lighting fires and outdoor cooking. And they also need to have some kind of shelter in the designated forest school area. We have therefore combined these two requirements into one product which is the fire pit shelter and fire pit/cooking cabin.
The fire pit shelter has a special roof with a ventilation hole to let the fire smoke exhaust upwards and a special two tier roof cowl which stops the rain getting through. Two coats of a special fire retardant are also applied to the underside of the roof.

 
The fire pit cabin is an enclosed building which has a central fire and cooking facility with exhaust flue where children can cook food on fires which they have built.

This year’s theme is INTO ORBIT and teams of 9 – 16 year olds will be taken on an ‘out of this world’ experience as they explore space-themed engineering problems, and build and programme robots. Finally, they will compete in the Cambridgeshire regional tournament, which will take place at the University of Cambridge’s Department of Engineering on Tuesday, 15 January 2019.
Designed to encourage young people to take an interest in real world issues and develop technology skills, the challenge comprises three parts: the Robot Game, the Project, and the Core Values. This year’s project assignment will challenge teams of up to ten children to identify a physical or social problem faced by humans during long duration space exploration within our sun’s solar system and are encouraged to come up with a solution to the problem using robotics.
During the Robot Game, teams will programme an autonomous robot, using a LEGO® MINDSTORMS® kit, to score points on a themed playing field. These robots will be put to the test during the regional tournament where teams will compete with them to solve a number of missions.Throughout the entire FIRST® LEGO® League challenge, teams will operate under, and be asked to demonstrate, the FIRST® signature set of Core Values, celebrating discovery, innovation, impact, inclusion, teamwork and fun.
FIRST® LEGO® League, one of four programs offered by FIRST, is an annual international competition which sees over 250,000 young people (in 32,000 teams), from across 88 countries, come together to develop their STEM skills. Winners of the Cambridge regional tournament will be given the opportunity to progress to the UK and Ireland final in February, and then on to the World Festival in Detroit, Michigan, April 24-27.
Mandy Workman, IET Education Manager – FIRST® LEGO® League, comments: “This year is the 30th season of the FIRST® LEGO® League and every year I am intrigued to see the innovative ideas and solutions that the young people come up with – I think this year’s space theme will really spark the participants’ imaginations and throw up some very interesting ideas. As well as giving young people the opportunity to work in teams to develop their problem solving, critical thinking and presentation skills, FIRST® LEGO® League aims to prepare participants for work in the 21st century workplace, engaging them with robotics and providing engineering experience.”
Registration for the FIRST® LEGO® League 2018-19 season is now open to teams of up to ten individuals, aged 9 to 16 years.

College celebrates success one year after merger – Education Today,"['FE colleges', 'News']","August 31, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/college-celebrates-success-one-year-after-merger/,"The merger of two North East colleges has proved to be a “resounding success”, one year on.
Sunderland College merged with Hartlepool Sixth Form College in September 2017. There was overwhelming support for the merger, which also received backing from the Sixth Form Commissioner and FE Commissioner.
According to the College, a year on from the merger there have been significant benefits and the creation of new opportunities, alongside improved outcomes for students, staff and other stakeholders.
The College has reported an overall increase in AS Level and A-Level pass rates and the overall pass rate for both colleges combined is an impressive 97.5%. The merger has also secured the financial future of the only bespoke sixth form college in Hartlepool and has enabled substantial new investments in the learning environment, with a brand new, state-of-the-art digital academy and curriculum launching this September.
The merger resulted in a single governing board and consolidated leadership, along with new regional job roles working across both college sites for back office staff and support services. Staff at both colleges have been sharing best practice and some have progressed into newly created leadership positions.
Ellen Thinnesen, Principal and Chief Executive, has overall responsibility for both Sunderland College and Hartlepool Sixth Form College. She commented: “We passionately believe in delivering educational opportunities and a high quality learning experience, with students at the heart of everything we do. It has been a pleasure working in partnership with colleagues and stakeholders within Hartlepool and across the wider Tees Valley. We look forward to this collaborative approach continuing.
“We are delighted to report that one year on, the merger has created more opportunities for our stakeholders including students, staff and employers; ensured the future stability of Hartlepool Sixth Form College; improved performance; and enabled both colleges to meet the needs of its local people and local business community.
“Together we have become more resilient, and with our shared vision for excellence, we are creating a future that is ambitious and successful and offers long-term growth.”
Mark Hughes, who was appointed Head of Hartlepool Sixth Form College last August, said: “During the last 12 months, since merger, we have experienced significant improvements. We are currently enrolling our new intake of students and have seen a 3% increase in applications compared to last year. We are enjoying working with our colleagues at Sunderland and look forward to the future.”
There are currently 266 further education and sixth form colleges in England. This compares to almost 450 when colleges were incorporated in 1993. This change has seen the education sector having to transform and adapt in response to rapidly changing political and economic environments.
Sunderland College is one of the largest providers of post-16 education in the North East with three campuses across the city of Sunderland and the sixth form college in Hartlepool.

"Decline in humanities A levels affecting university entries, warns British Academy – Education Today","['A levels', 'Modern languages', 'News']","August 16, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/decline-in-humanities-a-levels-affecting-university-entries-warns-british-academy/,"As A level results come out today, the British Academy warns that fewer students studying humanities subjects threatens the future of these subjects at university level.
New analysis published today by the national academy for the humanities and social sciences points to a decline in A level entries in modern languages, English, History and Geography, with similar trends seenin undergraduate and postgraduate numbers.
According to provisional entry data, the number of students taking German A level in England this year is down 16% on 2017, while entries for French fell by 8% in the same period.
Entries for English subjects (English; English Literature; English Language & Literature) have declined by 9%, and Religious Studies by 23%, since last year.
There has been a promising increase in Spanish and other modern languages in recent years, but this is not enough to reverse the steady decline in the number of students leaving school with foreign language skills.
The British Academy warns that trends at A level are having a knock-on effect on higher education.
Between 2012-13 and 2016-17, the number of students studying languages at university fell by 14%. With fewer students applying, at least 10 modern languages departments have closed in the last decade, and a furthernine significantly downsized.
The British Academy is warning that a decline in the humanities puts the national skillset at risk. Insights from the arts, humanities and social sciences will be vital to ‘future proof’ the workforce in an ageof automation and rapid change, alongside skills from science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM), according to recentresearch from the British Academy.
Professor Sir David Cannadine, historian and President of the British Academy said:“At the British Academy, we are concerned that the decline in students studying humanities subjects at A level is already having an impact on the skills of the future workforce, especially when it comes to foreign languages.
“In an age of shifting diplomatic alignments, and with Brexit around the corner, our lack of language skills could put the UK at a major disadvantage when forging global connections.
“The skills developed by studying humanities and social science subjects at A level and at university will be essential as we negotiate the challenges the UK faces, from AI to an ageing society and sustainable development.We will need people with insights from law, philosophy, politics and history, as well as from Britain’s outstanding STEM sector.
“The young people receiving their A level results today are the problem-solvers of tomorrow. It is vital that our education system provides them with opportunities to develop a broad range of skills and interests.”",a a level result come out today the british academy warns that fewer student studying humanity subject threatens the future of these subject at university level new analysis published today by the national academy for the humanity and social science point to a decline in a level entry in modern language english history and geography with similar trend seenin undergraduate and postgraduate number according to provisional entry data the number of student taking german a level in england this year is down on while entry for french fell by in the same period entry for english subject english english literature english language literature have declined by and religious study by since last year there ha been a promising increase in spanish and other modern language in recent year but this is not enough to reverse the steady decline in the number of student leaving school with foreign language skill the british academy warns that trend at a level are having a knockon effect on higher education between and the number of student studying language at university fell by with fewer student applying at least modern language department have closed in the last decade and a furthernine significantly downsized the british academy is warning that a decline in the humanity put the national skillset at risk insight from the art humanity and social science will be vital to future proof the workforce in an ageof automation and rapid change alongside skill from science technology engineering and math stem according to recentresearch from the british academy professor sir david cannadine historian and president of the british academy saidat the british academy we are concerned that the decline in student studying humanity subject at a level is already having an impact on the skill of the future workforce especially when it come to foreign language in an age of shifting diplomatic alignment and with brexit around the corner our lack of language skill could put the uk at a major disadvantage when forging global connection the skill developed by studying humanity and social science subject at a level and at university will be essential a we negotiate the challenge the uk face from ai to an ageing society and sustainable will need people with insight from law philosophy politics and history a well a from britain outstanding stem sector the young people receiving their a level result today are the problemsolvers of tomorrow it is vital that our education system provides them with opportunity to develop a broad range of skill and interest,"['university', 'math', 'studying', 'decline', 'tomorrow', 'undergraduate', 'ageing', 'professor', 'recentresearch', 'brexit']"

The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time schools tour to visit 60 secondary schools across the UK – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'Drama', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Secondary schools']","August 3, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time-schools-tour-to-visit-60-secondary-schools-across-the-uk/,"A specially staged production of the National Theatre’s award-winning play, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time will begin a 12-week tour to 60 schools across the UK in September 2018.
The production will visit five selected secondary schools each week across London and the UK, touring to the National Theatre’s six Theatre Nation partner areas: Outer East London in partnership with the Queen’s Theatre Hornchurch; Wakefield, in partnership with the Theatre Royal; Doncaster, in partnership with Cast; Sunderland in partnership with Sunderland Empire and Sunderland Culture; Wolverhampton, in partnership with the Grand Theatre; and the Greater Manchester area in partnership with The Lowry, Salford.
The schools tour is a 90-minute version of the play performed in the round and will be followed by a Q&A session for students with the company. The tour is accompanied by a learning programme which includes professional development for teachers led by the NT and Curious Incident movement directors Frantic Assembly, as well as curriculum-based resources and workshops.
The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time brings Mark Haddon’s best-selling novel to life on stage, adapted by two-time Olivier Award-winning playwright Simon Stephens and directed by Olivier and Tony Award®‑winning director Marianne Elliott. The novel has won more than 17 literary awards and is widely studied in schools. Simon Stephens’ adaptation is a set text for GCSE English Literature.
The play tells the story of Christopher John Francis Boone, who is fifteen years old. He stands besides Mrs Shears’ dead dog, Wellington, who has been speared with a garden fork, it is seven minutes after midnight and Christopher is under suspicion. He records each fact in a book he is writing to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington. He has an extraordinary brain, and is exceptional at maths while ill-equipped to interpret everyday life. He has never ventured alone beyond the end of his road, he detests being touched and distrusts strangers. But his detective work, forbidden by his father, takes him on a frightening journey that upturns his world.
Speaking about the schools tour Simon Stephens said: “It means the world to me that Curious Incident will be touring schools around the country. I worked as a schoolteacher teaching kids in Dagenham in Essex 20 years ago. I loved it. I still think of myself as a teacher. I have seen firsthand how inspiring drama is to young people in schools. I believe the arts to be fundamental to our society. We can’t afford to lose them from our education system. I am delighted that our play will play its part in introducing young people to the theatre. I always hoped that Curious Incident was a play that could be performed anywhere, by anyone. The play is designed to provoke and inspire imagination and interpretation in its staging and inspiration in its audience. The tour will, I hope, provide the same kind of imagination and inspiration throughout the country.”
Alice King-Farlow, Director of Learning at the National Theatre said, “At the National Theatre we believe that all young people should have the opportunity to experience and participate in drama no matter where they are in the UK. We’re delighted to be touring this award-winning play to schools, and via our Theatre Nation Partnerships, we hope that bringing Simon Stephen’s brilliant Curious Incident to young audiences across the country will help to spark imaginations and encourage participation in theatre”.",a specially staged production of the national theatre awardwinning play the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime will begin a week tour to school across the uk in september the production will visit five selected secondary school each week across london and the uk touring to the national theatre six theatre nation partner area outer east london in partnership with the queen theatre hornchurch wakefield in partnership with the theatre royal doncaster in partnership with cast sunderland in partnership with sunderland empire and sunderland culture wolverhampton in partnership with the grand theatre and the greater manchester area in partnership with the lowry salford the school tour is a minute version of the play performed in the round and will be followed by a qa session for student with the company the tour is accompanied by a learning programme which includes professional development for teacher led by the nt and curious incident movement director frantic assembly a well a curriculumbased resource and workshop the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime brings mark haddons bestselling novel to life on stage adapted by twotime olivier awardwinning playwright simon stephen and directed by olivier and tony awardwinning director marianne elliott the novel ha won more than literary award and is widely studied in school simon stephen adaptation is a set text for gcse english literature the play tell the story of christopher john francis boone who is fifteen year old he stand besides mr shear dead dog wellington who ha been speared with a garden fork it is seven minute after midnight and christopher is under suspicion he record each fact in a book he is writing to solve the mystery of who killed wellington he ha an extraordinary brain and is exceptional at math while illequipped to interpret everyday life he ha never ventured alone beyond the end of his road he detests being touched and distrust stranger but his detective work forbidden by his father take him on a frightening journey that upturn his world speaking about the school tour simon stephen said it mean the world to me that curious incident will be touring school around the country i worked a a schoolteacher teaching kid in dagenham in essex year ago i loved it i still think of myself a a teacher i have seen firsthand how inspiring drama is to young people in school i believe the art to be fundamental to our society we cant afford to lose them from our education system i am delighted that our play will play it part in introducing young people to the theatre i always hoped that curious incident wa a play that could be performed anywhere by anyone the play is designed to provoke and inspire imagination and interpretation in it staging and inspiration in it audience the tour will i hope provide the same kind of imagination and inspiration throughout the country alice kingfarlow director of learning at the national theatre said at the national theatre we believe that all young people should have the opportunity to experience and participate in drama no matter where they are in the uk were delighted to be touring this awardwinning play to school and via our theatre nation partnership we hope that bringing simon stephen brilliant curious incident to young audience across the country will help to spark imagination and encourage participation in theatre,"['week', 'teacher', 'curriculumbased', 'midnight', 'september', 'staged', 'theatre', 'playwright', 'awardwinning', 'schoolteacher']"
V&A announces over 60 loans to regions in educational initiative backed by Grayson Perry – Education Today,"['Art & Craft', 'Design & Build', 'News']","August 1, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/va-announces-over-60-loans-to-regions-in-educational-initiative-backed-by-grayson-perry/,"The V&A recently announced that over 60 objects will travel to five locations across England from September 2018 to support the teaching of art, design and technology in secondary schools, as part of its educational initiative DesignLab Nation. Highlights include a ceramic tile by the Turner prize-winning artist Grayson Perry to Blackburn Museum, a brightly coloured scarf by luxury fashion designer Mary Katrantzou to the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry and ceramics by Christopher Dresser to the Potteries Museum in Stoke-on-Trent.
From September 2018, the V&A will work with the following regional partners: the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry, Potteries Museum in Stoke-on-Trent, the National Glass Centre in Sunderland, Blackburn Museum and Museums Sheffield. Selected in consultation with the DesignLab Nation partners, the loans will ensure that all visitors to the partner museums have the chance to experience the V&A’s collections in the context of their regional histories.
Grayson Perry said: “A House for Essex was a particularly special and personal project for me, so I’m delighted that a piece of it is travelling up to Blackburn to support the V&A’s DesignLab Nation. There is a very worrying decline in the take-up of creative subjects in state schools. If we care about social mobility, wellbeing and economic growth – and if we want our creative industries to continue to flourish – we urgently need to rebalance our education system so that the arts are valued just as much as other subjects.”
Director of the V&A Tristram Hunt said: “As our creative economy grows, international competition accelerates, and the provision of creative subjects in schools is squeezed, art and design education is needed more than ever. By bringing together local industry, museums and schools, DesignLab Nation will ensure that the V&A works with communities across the country to educate and inspire the artists, innovators and designers of tomorrow.”
DesignLab Nation brings together secondary schools, local museums and locally based industry and designers to inspire and preserve the essential role of Art, Design and Technology education. Young people will be encouraged to make their own contemporary responses to historical processes, and to gain an understanding of how collections from the past can inform new ideas.

Student stationery design competition winners announced – Education Today,"['Competition', 'News']","July 30, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/student-stationery-design-competition-winners-announced/,"Students from Staffordshire University managed a clean sweep in the inaugural Student Stationery Design Awards, managing to win all three placements – with entries from one hardworking student being chosen twice!
Leanne Haycock, a 3rd year student in Graphic Design, created entries for both the Portico Design and Paperchase design briefs, and was rewarded by being chosen by both design directors as their placement winner.
“Leanne’s work stood out for being well-presented, well thought out, with two distinct styles and solutions for each brief,” said Iona Purchas, creative manager at Portico Designs in Bath.
Gemma Parris, pattern design manager at Paperchase agreed, saying “Leanne’s entries were certainly the most commercial and we look forward to working with her.”
The entry from Zoe Benjamin, also a 3rd year student, but studying 3D Design Ceramics, was selected by Nicola Breen, design director for Caroline Gardner.
“Zoe’s design experience, and her entry, which championed the idea of taking a pause during a working day and making writing a letter or note a pleasurable experience – resonates well with the lifestyle products we are developing at Caroline Gardner,” commented Nicola.
This is the first time The Paper Library and Stationery Show London have collaborated to encourage stationery suppliers and retailers to support student design. The competition attracted entries from Universities in Cardiff, Bath, Birmingham and the University of the West of England in Bristol as well as Staffordshire.
“We’re very grateful to Caroline Gardner, Paperchase and Portico Design for supporting this first competition and we’ll continue to back The Paper Library in their quest to develop a placement programme for students and alert them to the opportunities within the stationery industry to use their skills,” said Vanessa Fortnam, head of content & PR, for Stationery Show London.

NatWest celebrates smashing their target as another 1.5 million young people are taught MoneySense – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'Financial education', 'News']","July 27, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/natwest-celebrates-smashing-their-target-as-another-1-5-million-young-people-are-taught-moneysense/,"NatWest has announced that they have exceeded their MoneySense financial education target set in October 2015, to educate a further 1 million young people about money by the end of 2018. Since this commitment, NatWest are pleased to report that they have reached a further 1.5 million young people through their free and impartial financial education resources, thanks to the support of staff, volunteers and school teachers.
As one of the first schools in the country to become an accredited MoneySense School, it was fitting that NatWest visit Heymann Primary School in Nottingham to make the announcement.
Heymann Primary is one of only 30 schools in the country, who have undertaken NatWest’s new MoneySense School Accreditation Programme. The new programme has been designed to encourage all pupils to participate in financial education, taking learning out of the classroom and into the day-to-day lives of young people. MoneySense accredited schools proactively introduce parents to the resources available through the MoneySense website in school communications so that financial education can continue at home and improve parent’s knowledge and confidence when talking to their children about money.
Financial Research from the Money Advice Service shows increasing evidence that by the age of seven, children have developed their attitude and values towards money. These attitudes and values are likely to stay with them for life. Only 43% of young people are confident managing their money, 59% of 16-17 year olds can’t read a pay slip and 32% have no experience of putting money into a bank account. With ever evolving technology and trends continuing towards less physical cash, MoneySense plays a vital role in young people’s financial education from primary school to high school.
Kirsty Britz, Director of Sustainable Banking, NatWest, said:
“We are delighted to have reached and exceeded our target – teaching another 1.5 million young people about money. At NatWest, we know the importance of getting into good money habits early. So I’m pleased we’ve also been able to support those schools that want to go one step further in encouraging children to learn about how to manage money.
Financial education should be available for all children. And with one third of parents worrying their children will ask them a question about money that they themselves can’t answer, the earlier we intervene to support teachers and parents with up-to-date information, the better.
I encourage schools and parents alike to use these free NatWest resources in their classrooms, and at home – it’s easy to register at mymoneysense.com.”
 
NatWest MoneySense is the free and impartial flagship financial education programme from NatWest for 5–18 year-olds, helping young people to make sense of money and build a better financial future.
Earlier this year, NatWest MoneySense introduced a new workshop module to teach young people aged 8-12 about the importance of avoiding scams and increase their awareness of fraud. The new fraud workshop saw pupils having to solve a number of clues and identify different types of fraud to help them learn how to keep themselves and their families safe from fraud and scams. This year, MoneySense has also introduced resources specially designed for children with special educational needs and disabilities, as well as modules designed to tackle the increasing number of Money Mule schemes and gambling related issues facing young people.",natwest ha announced that they have exceeded their moneysense financial education target set in october to educate a further million young people about money by the end of since this commitment natwest are pleased to report that they have reached a further million young people through their free and impartial financial education resource thanks to the support of staff volunteer and school teacher a one of the first school in the country to become an accredited moneysense school it wa fitting that natwest visit heymann primary school in nottingham to make the announcement heymann primary is one of only school in the country who have undertaken natwests new moneysense school accreditation programme the new programme ha been designed to encourage all pupil to participate in financial education taking learning out of the classroom and into the daytoday life of young people moneysense accredited school proactively introduce parent to the resource available through the moneysense website in school communication so that financial education can continue at home and improve parent knowledge and confidence when talking to their child about money financial research from the money advice service show increasing evidence that by the age of seven child have developed their attitude and value towards money these attitude and value are likely to stay with them for life only of young people are confident managing their money of year old cant read a pay slip and have no experience of putting money into a bank account with ever evolving technology and trend continuing towards le physical cash moneysense play a vital role in young people financial education from primary school to high school kirsty britz director of sustainable banking natwest said we are delighted to have reached and exceeded our target teaching another million young people about money at natwest we know the importance of getting into good money habit early so im pleased weve also been able to support those school that want to go one step further in encouraging child to learn about how to manage money financial education should be available for all child and with one third of parent worrying their child will ask them a question about money that they themselves cant answer the earlier we intervene to support teacher and parent with uptodate information the better i encourage school and parent alike to use these free natwest resource in their classroom and at home it easy to register at natwest moneysense is the free and impartial flagship financial education programme from natwest for yearolds helping young people to make sense of money and build a better financial future earlier this year natwest moneysense introduced a new workshop module to teach young people aged about the importance of avoiding scam and increase their awareness of fraud the new fraud workshop saw pupil having to solve a number of clue and identify different type of fraud to help them learn how to keep themselves and their family safe from fraud and scam this year moneysense ha also introduced resource specially designed for child with special educational need and disability a well a module designed to tackle the increasing number of money mule scheme and gambling related issue facing young people,"['britz', 'moneysense', 'classroom', 'banking', 'october', 'parent', 'teacher', 'uptodate', 'volunteer', 'daytoday']"
Local 10 year old Giselle wins nationwide invention competition – Education Today,"['Competition', 'Educational event', 'Health, Hygiene & Safety', 'News', 'STEM']","July 25, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/local-10-year-old-giselle-wins-nationwide-invention-competition/,"With a shocking 170 operations a day in the UK to remove rotten teeth in children, to engage kids with brushing, the Aquafresh Inventors Academy wanted to get children involved in making brush time more fun. The winning invention came from Giselle, 10 from Kennington, London, called ‘Brushing Explosions’. Giselle’s design is a ‘Create Your Own’ toothbrush with a number of elements that children can change around to make brush time something that they look forward to every day.
Giselle clinched the title by scoring highly for innovation, creativity, quality and on the effectiveness of making brush time more fun from the judges: Dominic Wilcox, Chief Inventor at Little Inventors, representatives from Aquafresh and from the Science Museum. As well as seeing her creation actually made by Dominic, Giselle won her class a sleepover at the Science Museum and her school, Archbishop Sumner Primary School, £1,000 worth of school equipment.
Giselle said she was “extremely delighted to win” and she “worked extremely hard” on creating the standout invention to make brush time more fun for herself and her peers: “I can’t believe that I have won the Aquafresh Inventors Academy competition 2018 – I love inventing and designing and want to be an architect when I am older so this has really given me the confidence to pursue my dreams.”
Emma Pittendreigh, from Aquafresh, comments: “We’re leaders in kids’ oral health and it’s important that we help address the crisis of tooth decay in children by making brush time fun for them, instead of something they try to avoid. We’re also proud to be encouraging an interest in STEM topics (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Giselle even wants to be an architect when she grows up and this competition has really boosted her confidence in this area!
“There is a shortage of technical skills and experience in STEM, especially in young girls, and to see so many creative inventions come in has been truly inspiring. We whittled down almost 400 entries to find our winner and it was such a difficult decision.”
Chief Inventor at Little Inventors, Dominic Wilcox was extremely impressed with the entries: “It was such an honour to look through all of the inventions for the Aquafresh Inventors Academy – there were so many great inventions, it was difficult to pick a single winner. Giselle’s winning invention really stood out for me, I scored ‘Brushing Explosions’ top marks for both innovation and creativity and it’s been a great experience bringing it to life over the past few weeks.”
Well done to all the children that took part in the Aquafresh Inventors Academy competition and congratulations to Giselle. Be sure to look out for next year’s competition, which will once again encourage kids to get involved, get creative and get inventing!",with a shocking operation a day in the uk to remove rotten teeth in child to engage kid with brushing the aquafresh inventor academy wanted to get child involved in making brush time more fun the winning invention came from giselle from kennington london called brushing explosion giselles design is a create your own toothbrush with a number of element that child can change around to make brush time something that they look forward to every day giselle clinched the title by scoring highly for innovation creativity quality and on the effectiveness of making brush time more fun from the judge dominic wilcox chief inventor at little inventor representative from aquafresh and from the science museum a well a seeing her creation actually made by dominic giselle won her class a sleepover at the science museum and her school archbishop sumner primary school worth of school equipment giselle said she wa extremely delighted to win and she worked extremely hard on creating the standout invention to make brush time more fun for herself and her peer i cant believe that i have won the aquafresh inventor academy competition i love inventing and designing and want to be an architect when i am older so this ha really given me the confidence to pursue my dream emma pittendreigh from aquafresh comment were leader in kid oral health and it important that we help address the crisis of tooth decay in child by making brush time fun for them instead of something they try to avoid were also proud to be encouraging an interest in stem topic science technology engineering and mathematics giselle even want to be an architect when she grows up and this competition ha really boosted her confidence in this area there is a shortage of technical skill and experience in stem especially in young girl and to see so many creative invention come in ha been truly inspiring we whittled down almost entry to find our winner and it wa such a difficult decision chief inventor at little inventor dominic wilcox wa extremely impressed with the entry it wa such an honour to look through all of the invention for the aquafresh inventor academy there were so many great invention it wa difficult to pick a single winner giselles winning invention really stood out for me i scored brushing explosion top mark for both innovation and creativity and it been a great experience bringing it to life over the past few week well done to all the child that took part in the aquafresh inventor academy competition and congratulation to giselle be sure to look out for next year competition which will once again encourage kid to get involved get creative and get inventing,"['invention', 'impressed', 'museum', 'science', 'mathematics', 'competition', 'innovation', 'aquafresh', 'winning', 'toothbrush']"

The proposals aim to ensure children are taught about mental wellbeing and how to recognise when they and others are struggling with mental health and how to respond.
Welcoming the news, Beat’s Director of External Affairs Tom Quinn said:
“These new proposals recognise the importance of mental health for children. Anorexia nervosa is the second highest onset mental illness among girls aged 15 to 19, and doctors are reporting more diagnoses of eating disorders than ever.
“The proposals list mental wellbeing and keeping safe online alongside physical health and fitness. Measures to improve children’s physical health, such as anti-obesity campaigns, must also consider their mental health and the effect they may have on people vulnerable to eating disorders.
“Schools can play a vital role in ensuring children get help for an eating disorder early, which gives them the best chance of recovery. Health education must include spotting the signs of eating disorders and what to do if a young person is worried about their own or a friend’s health.”

Knowsley Safari partners with reading charity Beanstalk to offer Merseyside school children ‘Somewhere Special to Read’ – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Community engagement', 'Literacy', 'News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'Primary schools']","July 20, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/knowsley-safari-partners-with-reading-charity-beanstalk-to-offer-merseyside-school-children-somewhere-special-to-read/,"Children from primary schools in Merseyside have been experiencing a unique safari-themed outdoor learning adventure as part of a special project to get more children excited about reading whilst encouraging them to learn and connect to the natural world around them.
The initiative was organised as part of a collaborative project between local reading charity Beanstalk and Knowsley Safari – a partnership which aims to help more school children develop a love of reading while extending their learning beyond the classroom through a range of outdoor learning activities.
These activities include a series of inspirational storytelling workshops hosted by Knowsley Safari as part of Beanstalk’s ‘Somewhere Special to Read’ scheme. So far children from Hope Primary School, Millbrook Primary School and Knowsley Lane Primary School have been taking part.
Beanstalk works with schools across Merseyside and beyond to train and place volunteers who visit schools twice a week to support children that have fallen behind with reading or who need a bit of extra one-to-one help and encouragement.
As well as school staff a number of Beanstalk volunteers were also invited along to Knowsley Safari to be part of the children’s exciting learning experience. The visits saw children enjoying a VIP early entry into the park for a special story time set to the natural sights and sounds of the park’s animals and wildlife, building the anticipation and excitement for further exploration of the park. The children were then invited to handle some animal artefacts before enjoying the walking safari tour with two knowledgeable guides.
Christine Braithwaite, Area Manager for Beanstalk North West, said: “It has been a fantastic series of events so far and we are really lucky to be teaming up with the wonderful people at Knowsley Safari to offer such an exciting outdoor learning experience for the children. For many of the schools we work with, funded opportunities like these do not come up very often, so to be able to take the children on a learning experience beyond the limitations of the classroom is just fantastic. We are really grateful to Knowsley Safari for hosting the visits and also to Manchester Islamic Girls School who helped fund the trips, as did two private donors who covered the costs of the buses and the cost of an ice-cream for each of the children. Thanks to their generosity these children had such a special day and got so much out of the whole experience. We are really looking forward to more special projects as part of the partnership.”
Knowsley Safari’s Learning and Discovery Community Officer, Hayley Worsfold, says: “We always aim to develop new and exciting ways to connect people with the natural world. At Knowsley Safari, we pride ourselves on providing opportunities for members of the community most at need and our partnership with Beanstalk helps us to further achieve this.
“The children from all three of the schools we’ve worked with so far have worked so hard to develop their literacy skills and in recognition of this, were invited to enjoy the reading within the natural surroundings at Knowsley Safari.”
Debbie McConlough, Assistant Head Teacher at Hope Primary School, said: “The children and staff enjoyed themselves immensely and were so excited to tell everybody about it when they got back to school. They felt very special to have been picked and I think it gave them a real self-esteem boost.”

Cultural education charity Shakespeare Schools Foundation awarded prestigious Praemium Imperiale Grant for Young Artists – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Community engagement', 'Drama', 'Grants', 'Literacy', 'News']","July 19, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/cultural-education-charity-shakespeare-schools-foundation-awarded-prestigious-praemium-imperiale-grant-for-young-artists/,"Shakespeare Schools Foundation (SSF) has been awarded the Grant for Young Artists in the 30th anniversary year of The Praemium Imperiale.
Awarded by the Imperial Family of Japan on behalf of the Japan Arts Association, the global arts prize includes five categories not covered by The Nobel Prize – painting, sculpture, architecture, music, theatre and film. The prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions to the development and promotion of the arts.
SSF uses the unique power of Shakespeare to transform lives. At its core is the world’s largest youth drama Festival. Every year, Shakespeare Schools Festival unites up to 30,000 young people from all backgrounds and abilities in a journey that increases confidence, resilience and teamwork, giving thousands of young people from across the UK the crucial skills they need to succeed in life. The six month process culminates in exhilarating performance nights from primary, secondary and special educational needs schools at up to 136 theatres nationwide, every autumn.
This year marks SSF’s 18th birthday and the charity is celebrating working with 300,000 young people since it was established in 2000.
Last year, SSF reported that, as a result of taking part in the Festival: 99% of teachers agree that their students’ confidence increased, 90% of teachers said that their students were more enthusiastic about school and learning and 93% of students said that they enjoy working as a team more.
The announcement of the award came on Wednesday 11 July in the Royal Academy’s new Benjamin West Theatre. Festival schools, St Marylebone School and Greenfields Primary School, performed vignettes from Hamlet and Julius Caesar to an audience including The Japanese Ambassador to the UK and Lord Patten of Barnes, the UK’s International Advisor to the award.
Chief Executive Ruth Brock said: “On behalf of Shakespeare Schools Foundation I am deeply honoured to accept the Grant for Young Artists Award. Shakespeare is the birthright of every child. His extraordinary works with their universal themes and beautiful language can, with the right help, belong to everyone. With SSF, children make friends, do better in class and gain the skills they need for life. Further than that, art transcends borders, heals divisions, nurtures empathy and collaboration. And as the world’s greatest playwright, Shakespeare teaches us all more about what it means to be human.
In our 18th birthday year, this is a wonderful recognition of SSF’s work so far. We are deeply grateful to the Japan Art Association and are strengthened in our determination to ensure we continue to use Shakespeare to transform children’s lives.”
Charity patron Jamila Gavin who attended the morning’s announcement said: “Whenever children come into contact with Shakespeare, beyond the textbook and into performance, it is a revelation for them. No longer is it some writer of the distant past placed on a pedestal by some elite, but a man whose ideas and perceptions are constantly relevant to everyone and anyone, at any age, from any background and any culture. This is why Shakespeare Schools Foundation is so valuable and so exciting – and nothing is more exciting than seeing young people bringing fresh interpretations to plays which, of all that has ever been written in the English language, demonstrates the universality of the human condition. I am proud to be a patron of a charity that is ensuring that the next generation, no matter their ability, can experience Shakespeare in such a real and relevant way.”
SSF has to raise £1 million each year to continue its work.

Science Museum Group launches new online adventure game Total Darkness – Education Today,"['Digital learning', 'Digital skills', 'News', 'STEM']","July 18, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/science-museum-group-launches-new-online-adventure-game-total-darkness/,"The Science Museum Group has launched Total Darkness, a digital storytelling experience which invites the player to solve a mysterious power cut in their hometown. The game, which is free to play, puts the player in control, allowing their choices and decisions to guide them through the story.
Available now, this interactive adventure game encourages young people to recognise how skills they use every day can help them develop their confidence in science thinking.
As each player navigates through the darkened streets of the town, armed only with a torch, they will face various challenges, from lost pets to melting ice cream, that require their skills of curiosity, communication and creative problem solving. Along the way they will encounter a cast of curious characters and discover new theories about what might have caused the blackout.
But with every step, their torch fades. The player must solve the mystery before the battery runs out. There are 5 theories to find and disprove in order to solve the power outage and win the game.
The player’s choices and actions throughout the game will score them curiosity, creativity or communication points. When the game ends, the skills the player has used will be revealed along with their science style, showing how they could put their skills into action in the real world.
Aimed at children aged 7-13, Total Darkness has been shaped and informed by the Science Museum Group’s work and research in informal science learning and science capital.
Susan Raikes, Director of Learning at the Science Museum said: ‘We hope that by playing the game, more people will see that science is a subject that goes beyond the classroom – it’s part of our everyday lives and something everyone can do and be a part of.’
Ben Templeton, Creative Director of Thought Den, said: ‘Too many young people are turned off by old science stereotypes but playing games is second nature. The skills they use every day in gaming apply throughout science, we just need to highlight the connection. So we made a game about science that doesn’t feel like a game about science.’

Hundreds of young people gather to say “Thank You” to First World War Generation – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'Educational event', 'History', 'News']","July 17, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/hundreds-of-young-people-gather-to-say-thank-you-to-first-world-war-generation/,"On Wednesday 11 July, the National Memorial Arboretum, in Staffordshire, part of the Royal British Legion, hosted around 750 young people from schools across the country for the Thank You Youth Festival, celebrating the invaluable contributions of the First World War generation and paying tribute to their legacy. The Festival featured a wide variety of cross-curricular workshops exploring the radical social and technological changes that occurred during the conflict.
The students took part in a wide range of activities, including being put through their paces by a ‘Sergeant Major’ on a First World War assault course, working alongside artists to learn how dazzle camouflage confounded u-boats, and uncovering personal stories about the contributions made by minority ethnic soldiers.
Each participating school was able to compile a customised programme of activities for their students. The day culminated with a mass gathering of students in Heroes’ Square to review the day’s activities and to join in saying a gigantic “Thank You” to the First World War generation as confetti cannons filled the air with streams of red, white and blue paper strands.

A team of four Year 9 students from Whalley Range High School in Manchester has fought off tough competition from hundreds of schools across England, Scotland and Wales to become the national champions of The Bright Ideas Challenge, Shell’s annual science competition for students aged 11-14 years.
With energy demands set to double by 2050, The Bright Ideas Challenge invites students to use their STEM skills, combined with creativity and teamwork, to come up with innovative energy solutions for making our future cities vibrant, healthy and clean places to live.
The winning team identified the energy created by city populations’ taking millions of steps a day as a potential source of energy and proposed the creation of ‘Electroes’.  These innovative power generating shoes would activate special piezoelectric discs built into the shoe’s soles to convert kinetic (movement) energy into use electrical energy to power personal devices.
The team’s creative energy idea took centre stage at Make the Future Live, a four day festival of innovation, held at The Olympic Park in London, where the team were also VIP guests.
At the festival hundreds of members of the public voted for the team’s ‘Electroes’ to win The Bright Ideas Challenge.  As a result of becoming national champions for The Bright Ideas Challenge, the team of girls, Khadija Kubra, Fatima Zahra, Saffiya Ahmad and Fatima Naser won £5,000 to spend on state of the art science equipment for their school.
The team of four were presented with their prize by Rachel Riley, Bright Ideas Challenge Ambassador and Bobby Seagull, University Challenge champion, Maths teacher and STEM ambassador.
Saffiya Ahmad, the team captain from Whalley Range School said: “Seeing our idea take centre stage at such a massive international festival that’s all about innovation, and knowing that it’s been voted as the public’s favourite ‘bright idea’, is a totally unforgettable moment for the whole team. 
“It’s been so fun using what we’ve learnt with our science teacher to solve real world problems and help make a difference to all our lives in the future.”
Speaking about The Bright Ideas Challenge, Stephen Metcalf MP, The Government’s envoy for the Year of Engineering, commented: “It was a huge privilege to sit on Shell’s Bright Ideas Challenge judging panel and see the amazing creativity and talent of children from across the country.
“It’s so important that we help young people understand the connection between what they are learning in class and the impact those skills can have in shaping a better, brighter future. I hope that competitions like this inspire more children to become the scientists, engineers, innovators and problem solvers of the future.”",television presenter rachel riley right and mathematician bobby seagull left stand with the winner of the bright idea challenge on day two of make the future live at the queen olympic park on thursday july in london ed robinsonshell a team of four year student from whalley range high school in manchester ha fought off tough competition from hundred of school across england scotland and wale to become the national champion of the bright idea challenge shell annual science competition for student aged year with energy demand set to double by the bright idea challenge invite student to use their stem skill combined with creativity and teamwork to come up with innovative energy solution for making our future city vibrant healthy and clean place to live the winning team identified the energy created by city population taking million of step a day a a potential source of energy and proposed the creation of electroes these innovative power generating shoe would activate special piezoelectric disc built into the shoe sol to convert kinetic movement energy into use electrical energy to power personal device the team creative energy idea took centre stage at make the future live a four day festival of innovation held at the olympic park in london where the team were also vip guest at the festival hundred of member of the public voted for the team electroes to win the bright idea challenge a a result of becoming national champion for the bright idea challenge the team of girl khadija kubra fatima zahra saffiya ahmad and fatima naser won to spend on state of the art science equipment for their school the team of four were presented with their prize by rachel riley bright idea challenge ambassador and bobby seagull university challenge champion math teacher and stem ambassador saffiya ahmad the team captain from whalley range school said seeing our idea take centre stage at such a massive international festival thats all about innovation and knowing that it been voted a the public favourite bright idea is a totally unforgettable moment for the whole team it been so fun using what weve learnt with our science teacher to solve real world problem and help make a difference to all our life in the future speaking about the bright idea challenge stephen metcalf mp the government envoy for the year of engineering commented it wa a huge privilege to sit on shell bright idea challenge judging panel and see the amazing creativity and talent of child from across the country it so important that we help young people understand the connection between what they are learning in class and the impact those skill can have in shaping a better brighter future i hope that competition like this inspire more child to become the scientist engineer innovator and problem solver of the future,"['seagull', 'festival', 'competition', 'mathematician', 'annual', 'scientist', 'thursday', 'july', 'champion', 'olympic']"
High quality autism education training set to reach more children – Education Today,"['Charity', 'News', 'SEND']","July 16, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/high-quality-autism-education-training-set-to-reach-more-children/,"The Autism Education Trust (AET) is set to help more autistic children and young people get the education they deserve following a two-year extension of its contract with the Department for Education (DfE).
The Trust, which recently reached its 10th anniversary, is the leading autism training and support programme for education settings and practitioners. Its evidence based programme is developed in consultation with prominent autism education academics and professionals, and with the direct involvement of people on the autistic spectrum.
The DfE’s continued support means that the Trust will be able to help increasing number of practitioners in education settings (0 – 25) to respond to the needs of children and young people with autism. It will also ensure that all of the AET’s training materials and resources can continue to be regularly updated so that they are in line with the latest research, ensuring the highest quality.
The AET’s training programmes are delivered through contracted licence partners trained and supported by the Trust. The introduction of a new partnership approach will allow prospective training partners to directly join its delivery network. It is offering licence agreements in local authority areas across the three education phases: early years settings, schools and colleges, and universities. As a not-for-profit organisation, the partners benefit from competitively priced licence fees as well as direct access to AET’s support network.
The introduction of the delivery partnership approach coincides with the launch of the AET’s brand new website. The new platform will support the rapidly growing partner numbers as well as assisting training delegates and delivery partners with an array of new functionalities and tools, and a more intuitive user experience.
Bob Lowndes, director at the AET, explains the significance of the DfE’s support: “More than one in 100 children globally are on the autism spectrum, including around 120,000 school-aged children in England, over 70 per cent of whom go to mainstream schools. This means that education professionals are bound to work with autistic students and therefore, improving the understanding of autism across the entire education sector is imperative.
“Our vision is to see all autistic children and young people receive an education that enables them to fulfil their aspirations and engage in society as active citizens. To date, we have trained over 180,000 professionals; with the DfE’s support we aim to extend our reach to all local authority areas. At a time of critical funding challenges throughout the system, the DfE’s commitment highlights the importance of the work we are doing; its recognition is invaluable.”

FXP Festival is linked to the computer science curriculum and uses computer games to increase interest and uptake of STEM subjects, build young people’s digital skills and provide an insight into what careers in the technology, creative digital and related industries might offer.
Announced on the final day of FXP, the Extended Challenge will see students across Cambridgeshire going head-to-head to create an innovative app idea. From 21 January to 25 March 2019, students will work independently to design a mobile app that gamifies a solution to an important global problem linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. App ideas will be judged by Arm’s team of experts and five winning students will win the opportunity to visit Arm for work experience during the summer of 2019.
Simon Humphrey, senior manager, Corporate Responsibility, Arm, commented: “We want to encourage students to explore the exciting opportunities a career in the technology sector at a company like Arm can offer and, as such, we strive to provide as many avenues as possible to inspire young people in Cambridge and around the world to develop the skills they will need for the future. With its goal of providing an insight into the technology industry, while helping students develop their creative and digital skills, FXP Festival aligns perfectly with our mission.”

“One of our key motivations for organising FXP is our mission to drive social mobility in the region and help close the technology skills gap. Being able to give students the opportunity to compete to win a work experience placement at Arm brings us another step closer to this goal. Arm has been a great supporter of FXP Festival since its beginnings and we are looking forward to working with the team more closely over the next year as the extended challenge comes to life.”",fxp festival is working with cambridgeheadquartered global technology leader arm to deliver an extended challenge for student in year who participated in this year fxp a game design and development competition which took place at cambridge regional college july fxp festival is linked to the computer science curriculum and us computer game to increase interest and uptake of stem subject build young people digital skill and provide an insight into what career in the technology creative digital and related industry might offer announced on the final day of fxp the extended challenge will see student across cambridgeshire going headtohead to create an innovative app idea from january to march student will work independently to design a mobile app that gamifies a solution to an important global problem linked to the un sustainable development goal app idea will be judged by arm team of expert and five winning student will win the opportunity to visit arm for work experience during the summer of simon humphrey senior manager corporate responsibility arm commented we want to encourage student to explore the exciting opportunity a career in the technology sector at a company like arm can offer and a such we strive to provide a many avenue a possible to inspire young people in cambridge and around the world to develop the skill they will need for the future with it goal of providing an insight into the technology industry while helping student develop their creative and digital skill fxp festival aligns perfectly with our mission alison taylor founder of fxp commented we have just completed our third fxp festival and every year it ha been fantastic to see so many young people light up with the excitement of game development art and technology and to see them gain a better understanding of the opportunity ready for them to grasp in the future one of our key motivation for organising fxp is our mission to drive social mobility in the region and help close the technology skill gap being able to give student the opportunity to compete to win a work experience placement at arm brings u another step closer to this goal arm ha been a great supporter of fxp festival since it beginning and we are looking forward to working with the team more closely over the next year a the extended challenge come to life,"['summer', 'college', 'cambridgeshire', 'student', 'compete', 'cambridge', 'competition', 'cambridgeheadquartered', 'july', 'festival']"
"Young people in Greater Manchester to benefit from £500,000 investment in careers education – Education Today","['Careers', 'FE colleges', 'Funding', 'Grants', 'News', 'Secondary schools']","July 11, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/young-people-in-greater-manchester-to-benefit-from-500000-investment-in-careers-education/,"Tens of thousands of Greater Manchester’s young people are set to benefit from over £500,000 of investment aimed at improving careers education and helping them identify the best career opportunities.
The city-region will become one of just 20 ‘Careers Hubs’ across England, designed to help young people develop relationships and connections with employers and businesses as well as being inspired to consider a wide range of employment opportunities.
Teachers and staff at 36 schools and colleges across Greater Manchester will receive intensified training and support from the new Bridge GM Careers Hub to develop an integrated approach to prepare 30,000 leavers for the world of work in the modern economy.
The funding, from the Careers & Enterprise Company, follows a successful bid by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and its partner organisations as part of a new nationwide careers strategy launched by the Government in December.
Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said: “To have bid for and received half a million pounds of funding is a great achievement; it will have a significant impact on Greater Manchester’s young people.
“For too long careers advice in our schools and colleges has been seen as an add-on to education. While the Bridge GM Careers Hub is about securing employment it is also about enabling our young people to prepare for, and locate, the right kind of work for them.
“This signals a significant step-change in preparing our young people for the world of work by educating them and making them aware of the opportunities in our dynamic regional economy.”
The Greater Manchester Careers Hub will launch at the start of the new academic year in September and will comprise schools and colleges from across all 10 boroughs in Greater Manchester.
The schools and colleges in the Hub will lead change and improvements in careers education working alongside specialist employers, universities, training providers, and career professionals to improve careers education.
The Bridge GM Careers Hub will have access to support and funding over two years and will help schools and colleges implement the eight Gatsby Benchmarks of excellent careers education.
Councillor Sean Fielding, Leader of Oldham Council and GMCA lead for Education and Skills, said: “The Bridge GM Careers Hub is a hugely exciting prospect for Greater Manchester, providing a robust system of support and best practice for the 36 schools and colleges involved.
“High quality careers education, information, advice and guidance is vital to ensuring all our young people transition from school and college ready for the challenge ahead.
“Greater Manchester is leading the charge to bridge the gap between business and education and the Bridge GM Careers Hub is another step to achieving our ambitions.”
Claudia Harris, Chief Executive of The Careers & Enterprise Company, said: “We’re excited by the potential impact of Hubs. If employers, schools and colleges can better prepare young people for the world of work, we’re not just benefiting the future economy, but improving prospects for thousands of young people.”",ten of thousand of greater manchester young people are set to benefit from over of investment aimed at improving career education and helping them identify the best career opportunity the cityregion will become one of just career hub across england designed to help young people develop relationship and connection with employer and business a well a being inspired to consider a wide range of employment opportunity teacher and staff at school and college across greater manchester will receive intensified training and support from the new bridge gm career hub to develop an integrated approach to prepare leaver for the world of work in the modern economy the funding from the career enterprise company follows a successful bid by the greater manchester combined authority and it partner organisation a part of a new nationwide career strategy launched by the government in december mayor of greater manchester andy burnham said to have bid for and received half a million pound of funding is a great achievement it will have a significant impact on greater manchester young people for too long career advice in our school and college ha been seen a an addon to education while the bridge gm career hub is about securing employment it is also about enabling our young people to prepare for and locate the right kind of work for them this signal a significant stepchange in preparing our young people for the world of work by educating them and making them aware of the opportunity in our dynamic regional economy the greater manchester career hub will launch at the start of the new academic year in september and will comprise school and college from across all borough in greater manchester the school and college in the hub will lead change and improvement in career education working alongside specialist employer university training provider and career professional to improve career education the bridge gm career hub will have access to support and funding over two year and will help school and college implement the eight gatsby benchmark of excellent career education councillor sean fielding leader of oldham council and gmca lead for education and skill said the bridge gm career hub is a hugely exciting prospect for greater manchester providing a robust system of support and best practice for the school and college involved high quality career education information advice and guidance is vital to ensuring all our young people transition from school and college ready for the challenge ahead greater manchester is leading the charge to bridge the gap between business and education and the bridge gm career hub is another step to achieving our ambition claudia harris chief executive of the career enterprise company said were excited by the potential impact of hub if employer school and college can better prepare young people for the world of work were not just benefiting the future economy but improving prospect for thousand of young people,"['employment', 'professional', 'education', 'employer', 'mayor', 'university', 'academic', 'cityregion', 'teacher', 'manchester']"

Bickley Park School took 26 boys – aged 12 and 13 years old – to test their own abilities in terms of motivation, team, and leadership skills.
As part of the challenge the boys tackled Ben Nevis and Scafell Pike before the final push up Snowdon. In between climbs the boys also stopped at Fort William where they undertook the additional test of canyoning and flew 125mph down the world’s fastest zip wire.
This is the first time the school has organised this adventure and it proved to be a special opportunity to really get to grips with nature and test their survival skills.
Stuart Bayley-Dainton, the trip organiser and leader said, “In the past our boys have walked Offa’s Dyke, but that was only boys who opted to participate. This year we wanted a challenge for the whole year group. The planning for this adventure began last year as we wanted to create an experience that would interest and excite the boys.
“In the run up to the event some of the students were excited and others had some quiet reservations as to how they would fare. However, they all excelled themselves and overcame and conquered many fears. It wasn’t an easy feat but they showed sheer grit, determination and teamwork returning home feeling energised and ready for any challenge!”

Volunteers transform Heaton School’s field – Education Today,"['Alternative curriculum', 'Community engagement', 'News', 'Secondary schools', 'SEND', 'Volunteering', 'Wellbeing']","July 4, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/volunteers-transform-heaton-schools-field/,"Volunteers have helped transform school grounds at the Heaton School to improve the learning environment for students.
Heaton School in Heaton Moor is Stockport’s Secondary Special School for young people with severe learning difficulties, profound and multiple learning difficulties, autism and complex medical needs. The school caters for students aged 11 – 19 years.
The school has been working hard over recent years in collaboration with The Rotary Club of Stockport Lamplighter to ‘rewild’ an area of the school field to help the school become a Forest School.
Forest School is an approach to teaching and learning that allows all students develop a wide range of skills and to improve their self-confidence and self-esteem through hands on experiences in natural environments with trees.
The volunteers from the Buckingham Group, McGinley, Network Rail and East-Tec Electrical Services helped to take the project onto the next stage, by donating their time and materials.
The volunteers enlarged the ‘firepit’ area in the grounds and created a path to improve access to the wild area and also installed new lighting to the garden area.
Headteacher at the Heaton School, Jo Chambers-Shirley said: “For medical, physical and sometimes emotional reasons, many of our students miss out on accessing wilderness areas. To have an area on site accessible and available for our students to enjoy therefore greatly enriches their lives.
“Through Forest School activities I have seen many students, and particularly those with the most complex needs, blossom and their self-esteem and mental well being improve. In addition their learning skills improve as well as their communication skills thus helping them develop friendships. We cannot thank the volunteers from Network Rail, McGinley and Buckinghams and East-Tec Electrical Services enough for the improvements they have made to our school grounds.”
Councillor Dean Fitzpatrick, Stockport Council’s Cabinet Member for Education said: “It’s fantastic that these volunteers have given their time and that their companies have donated materials to improve the learning experience of some of Stockport’s most challenged students.”",volunteer have helped transform school ground at the heaton school to improve the learning environment for student heaton school in heaton moor is stockports secondary special school for young people with severe learning difficulty profound and multiple learning difficulty autism and complex medical need the school caters for student aged year the school ha been working hard over recent year in collaboration with the rotary club of stockport lamplighter to rewild an area of the school field to help the school become a forest school forest school is an approach to teaching and learning that allows all student develop a wide range of skill and to improve their selfconfidence and selfesteem through hand on experience in natural environment with tree the volunteer from the buckingham group mcginley network rail and easttec electrical service helped to take the project onto the next stage by donating their time and material the volunteer enlarged the firepit area in the ground and created a path to improve access to the wild area and also installed new lighting to the garden area headteacher at the heaton school jo chambersshirley said for medical physical and sometimes emotional reason many of our student miss out on accessing wilderness area to have an area on site accessible and available for our student to enjoy therefore greatly enriches their life through forest school activity i have seen many student and particularly those with the most complex need blossom and their selfesteem and mental well being improve in addition their learning skill improve a well a their communication skill thus helping them develop friendship we can not thank the volunteer from network rail mcginley and buckinghams and easttec electrical service enough for the improvement they have made to our school ground councillor dean fitzpatrick stockport council cabinet member for education said it fantastic that these volunteer have given their time and that their company have donated material to improve the learning experience of some of stockports most challenged student,"['helping', 'donating', 'forest', 'student', 'learning', 'education', 'teaching', 'autism', 'volunteer', 'headteacher']"
Defra-backed project to plant 1 million trees with schools – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'Environmental Focus', 'News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'Primary schools']","July 3, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/defra-backed-project-to-plant-1-million-trees-with-schools/,"Trees for Learning is a major project to encourage schools to plant trees within school grounds and local green spaces. It forms part of DEFRA’s pledge to support schools to plant 1 million trees by 2020.
Working with the Woodland Trust, who are leading on delivery targeted at some of the most deprived areas of the country, England’s Community Forests are working together to hit the target of helping primary schools plant 164,000 trees, and with another two years to run on the project, they are well on their way.
Since the project began around 11 000 children from 350 schools have planted 65 000 trees and a cost-benefit analysis has evaluated the social and environmental impacts of the financial and human resources invested by Trees for Learning at the end of its second year at a staggering £18.3m.
Teachers reported increased knowledge of the natural environment, increased levels of physical activity and improved behaviour of children. Eighty percent of schools specified a major impact on improving the children’s outdoor learning.
Staff from Community Forests all over the country help schools decide what to plant and where by providing expert design advice. They then help schools to run planting days with children to ensure that the right type of trees go in the right places, maximising the chance of them being part of the landscape for generations to come.
Children all have the opportunity to plant a tree and watch them grow, and take part in activities to learn more about trees and woodlands, linked to the national curriculum. The planting days enable children living in urban areas to connect with nature in their local environment, learn about how trees link with other important issues like health and climate change, and create settings for outdoor learning and Forest Schools. Children plant a range of native broadleaves, fruit trees and conifers along with ‘useful trees’ such as willow and dogwood which can be used as art and craft resources. They learn the best way to plant, look after (and importantly for a generation we are often told spends less and less time outdoors), how to identify these trees when out and about.
Mersey Forest’s Trees for Learning project officer Steph Hepworth said, “Planting trees has a special significance for children in schools as many of them will be around to see their tree growing as they move up through the school. This helps to give them a sense of belonging to their surroundings and fosters a desire to nurture their environment. When we plant with the Year 6 children some of them feel sad that they won’t be around to see their tree come to maturity, but take great comfort from the thought younger siblings or friends will take care of it.”
The tree planting sessions give staff the opportunity to discuss biodiversity with the children: prompting them to consider what creatures will live in the hedgerows they’re now planting and how they could encourage more wildlife into their school environment. The work links to the national curriculum encouraging discussions about how trees and the environment are part of other important issues like health and climate change.
Feedback from the sessions has been extremely positive. One teacher reported, “I really noticed a change in one boy in particular who struggles with motor skills. He doesn’t enjoy activities such as PE and handwriting but was really enthusiastic about the tree planting. He chose to plant one of the bigger trees which meant digging a bigger hole and did not stop until he had achieved this.”
Follow up work is a crucial aspect of the project. When the team from the Mersey Forest revisited a school site to deliver the education follow-on sessions, they noticed that one area of woodland was being used by children during their lunchtime break and that some of the saplings were being inadvertently damaged.
During the education follow up session children expressed their concern about the trees and a desire to prevent further damage. After discussion with the children and staff, the team returned to the school and installed some stakes and mowed pathways to help to guide the children to take a fixed path through the area. Children also designed and made signs to educate their peers as to how to care for their woodlands via an assembly. The intention is to still allow the children to use the area but to ensure that the woodland has the chance to become established in the vital first years.
Another element of the follow up work sees children using survey methods to monitor their woodland. The activities are closely linked to the national curriculum and include identifying tree type, (deciduous/evergreen), notes on tree health and numbers and an estimate of tree size. The children survey an area of their new woodland using marked out quadrats (25m²) and report back their findings, before suggesting ways to fix any problems and planning their future use of the area. Monitoring will be ongoing for 2 years following the scheme, with schools given the opportunity to plant further trees should they wish to.
The next round of planting days with children will begin in the autumn and run into early spring 2019. If you know of a school who might like to be involved in the project contact your local community forest and ask to speak to Trees for Learning.

It’s time to make your move – Education Today,"['Health, Hygiene & Safety', 'News']","June 28, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/its-time-to-make-your-move/,"Active Wellbeing Week 
Monday 2 July – Friday 6 July 2018
A well-rounded health and wellbeing policy should aim to encourage active lifestyles; assist employees to strike a healthy work‑life balance; support people to achieve their personal goals; provide networking and teambuilding opportunities; and improve workplace morale and performance.
According to the Work Foundation, each year British workers have 15 million days off* due to stress, depression and anxiety, costing an estimated £70 billion each year. However, musculoskeletal health is also one of the major conditions affecting British workers with 23% of all lost days caused by back, neck and muscle pain.
Regular physical activity has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting some illnesses, like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. We now know that taking part in physical activity also helps to improve our general wellbeing. The NHS guidelines recommend that adults between 19 and 64 years of age should do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise every week, like brisk walking or cycling.
To improve the health and encourage more active lifestyle choices for employees in the public sector, CSSC Sports & Leisure has collaborated with CS Employee Policy (CSEP) to launch a nationwide Active Wellbeing Week which will take place between Monday 2 July and Friday 6 July 2018.
Active Wellbeing Week includes a series of initiatives designed specifically to help the thousands of public sector employees across the UK to be more active and affect positive changes in their physical and mental wellbeing.
We’re encouraging all public sector employees to take part in a nationwide make a pledge campaign, where individuals can make personal pledges on how they intend to be more active.  There are loads of fantastic prizes to win including spa days, pamper packs and a £2,500 holiday voucher.
For fun and inspiring ways to get your colleagues involved, there are plenty of ideas online at activewellbeing.me.uk where you’ll find suggestions for competitive tasks like step count or rowing challenges, or simple ideas to incorporate movement in your day like lunchtime walks or no-chair policies for meetings.
 Get involved
There are a few ways that individuals, team leaders and management can get involved and inspire others during Active Wellbeing Week.

Science students invited to showcase research at  the University of Oxford – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News', 'Science', 'Secondary schools']","June 28, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/science-students-invited-to-showcase-research-at-the-university-of-oxford/,"14 secondary school students from across the country have been invited to showcase their research on particle physics at a scientific conference being held in the Physics Department at the University of Oxford. The Institute for Research in Schools (IRIS) partnered with researchers at the University of Oxford on a project to analyse tracks from the ATLAS detector at CERN. Students analysed images and created posters on their results. They were then invited to then present their work to academics at the University. They also had a tour of the Oxford Physics Department, sat in on lectures, gained advice on applying to university and they stayed in Merton College.
Within the Higgs Hunters project students learned about research being conducted at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland
Through the initial Zooniverse Higgs Hunters project, members of the public flagged over one million interesting locations in images of CERN collisions while hunting for so-called “Baby Higgs” bosons. These are exotic particles which some scientists believe may form when a Higgs particle decays. Groups of students working with IRIS then further analysed the images to ascertain the reliability of the public’s classifications and enhance the analysis by inspired use of new algorithms and data analysis techniques.
Students who submitted impressive posters on their work were given the opportunity to present their research at the University of Oxford and to meet Professor Alan Barr and his team. The trip included a number of practical sessions and in depth discussions on the students work by academics who attended their poster presentation.
Of the trip, the students have said: “It gave me a chance to do proper physics and learn new skills. This has shown me the challenge and opportunities in research.”
Professor Alan Barr, who helped initiate the Higgs Hunters project, remarked that: “My colleagues and I have been incredibly impressed with the research that the students presented. We could never have imagined when this project started that we would see such a rich range of scientifically interesting topics being explored!
The director of IRIS, Professor Becky Parker, said: “IRIS aims to offer young people opportunities to contribute to cutting edge research. With Higgs Hunters the students came up with ideas and approaches which interested and delighted the academics showing how innovative young people can be and how well they respond to opportunities where they can flourish doing real science.”

Framework launches to improve scholarship work in College HE – Education Today,"['FE colleges', 'Higher education', 'News']","June 26, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/framework-launches-to-improve-scholarship-work-in-college-he/,"A new framework which aims to enhance scholarship in the college higher education sector has been launched today.
The Scholarship Framework is the main output from the Scholarship Project, led by the Association of Colleges and funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. It was set up in 2015 to help develop and embed a scholarly ethos across the college higher education sector.
The resources available on the Scholarship Framework have been created to centre on advancing relevant forms of scholarly activity within technical and professional curricula as well as enhancing the learning experience of students.
The framework will help colleges to develop their scholarship policies and practices and provide evidence for the Teaching Excellence Framework commentary, external quality assurance and assist those applying for degree awarding powers. Several universities have also indicated that the adaptation of the resources contained in the framework will improve the validation relationship.
So far over 50 colleges have agreed to adopt the Scholarship Framework. This includes colleges with less than 100 HE students to colleges with over 3000 students. The framework is free and will support colleges, regardless of where they are in their HE scholarship journey. Benefits of using the framework’s resources include assistance with developing a college scholarship policy and integrating scholarship into appraisal processes.
David Hughes, Chief Executive of the Association of Colleges, said: “The Scholarship Project will help by fostering a confidence within the college sector and by supporting a scholarly approach to HE. College staff should rightly feel proud of their craft, of their pedagogy and of the contribution they make to supporting students to develop their learning and skills.
“I am delighted at the breadth and scale of the Scholarship Project and at how enthusiastic colleges have been at embracing a critical, evidence-based and scholarly approach to their HE teaching and learning.”
John Lea, College Higher Education Scholarship Director, said: “College higher education students are offered a distinct learning experience. Providing local students with higher education opportunities and links with local labour markets are key. Our new framework aims to enhance this provision further by embedding a district approach to scholarship for both staff and students, one which is firmly centred on enhancing learning and student employability.”

Quarriers lends helping hand to children leaving primary school this summer – Education Today,"['Charity', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Social issues']","June 22, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/quarriers-lends-helping-hand-to-children-leaving-primary-school-this-summer/,"With the academic year coming to a close and around 45,000 pupils across Scotland getting ready to move from primary to secondary school, it can be a daunting time for the youngsters as they embark on the next chapter of their school life.
Quarriers Let’s Talk Service works with nine primary schools in the north east of Glasgow to address the impact transition has on young people’s mental health. Having worked together throughout the year, those schools now benefiting from the Transition Support module are Avenue End Primary School and Sunnyside Primary School in Craigend, Caledonia Primary School in Ballieston, Sandaig Primary School and Royston Primary in the East End, Cranhill Primary, Wallacewell Primary in Robroyston, Carntyne Primary and Wellshot Primary in Tollcross.
The Let’s Talk transition support offers a range of interventions to ensure that no youngster that is anxious about going to high school falls through the cracks. The programme, run by the social care charity, includes eight classroom lessons around mental health, with additional group work in school for children who have been identified as struggling with the change.
Alongside classes on transition support, a major part of the work carried out by Quarriers’ Let’s Talk Service is a weekly group which brings together children over the summer holidays to take part in group activities, allowing them to make new friends ahead of school starting and iron out any worries together.
Andrea McGowan, Quarriers Let’s Talk Project Worker said: “In our pilot year in 2016, we worked with three primary schools in the east end of Glasgow – Avenue End Primary School, Caledonia Primary School and Sandaig Primary School. Our days out in the summer holidays gave children the chance to meet up and make friends ensuring they would know a familiar face when school started in August.”
Two boys who hadn’t been identified as being apprehensive about the move and appeared confident in school were also found to be struggling to get their heads around the transition.
Andrea said: “During the leavers’ ceremony both boys were upset and within an hour of school finishing for summer, both boys visited my office asking to speak to me. We organised that they attend the weekly summer activity group and they both seemed to get a lot out of it.
“After the summer, they started high school. One of the boys still visits us now and again for a chat. He talks about the friends he made at the group and his plans for a weekend away with them. His visits are much less frequent but he knows that if he needs support, he can pop into the office at any time.
“Mental health amongst youngsters has really come to the fore making Let’s Talk such an important initiative. What makes this job so rewarding is helping these youngsters to face their fears and show them what they are capable of. Being a guiding hand and a reassuring presence during a time of change is vital and can make a real difference.”
One of the boys felt so empowered by the support he received he let Andrea know he wants to work for Quarriers in the future to give other children the same support.
With its Let’s Talk Service, and the transition support in particular, Quarriers hopes that primary seven children will have the opportunity to explore their concerns about moving on and reach a point where they can feel excited about this next chapter.

A taste of engineering for Essex primary school children – Education Today,"['Engineering', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'STEM']","June 20, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/a-taste-of-engineering-for-essex-primary-school-children/,"Year 6 pupils from Tollesbury Primary School in Essex recently got hands-on experience of a career in engineering at a special event hosted by a local engineering company.
Family-run Gibbons Engineering Group welcomed 23 children to its offices and workshops as part of its Year of Engineering 2018 partnership.
The Year of Engineering scheme is a government-led initiative to encourage young people to consider a career in engineering, and Gibbons arranged a number of activities designed to give the children a taste of the variety and challenges offered by the industry.
After being shown round Gibbons’ workshops and seeing engineers building control panels and repairing electric motors, the children were divided into two groups for the four activities.
The first activity saw the children identify places within the home where electric motors and pumps are used. Following this, the pupils built a motorised model car in small groups, which required them to follow instructions and work as a team.
The children also got the opportunity to build their own electric motor with a battery, paper clips, magnets and copper wire. Finally, they created a simple water pump from a bottle, straw and a balloon – a task which was so popular that the school is planning to demonstrate it to its Early Years pupils.
Once all activities had been completed, the children were presented with certificates and goody bags before returning to school.
Tollesbury Primary School Class Teacher Amanda Tomkins said: “I was in awe of the activities… the children relished the opportunities to get hands on and creative. I must commend all the staff for their patience, enthusiasm and willingness to help the children.”
Gibbons’ Marketing Manager Nadya Damhar arranged the event and said: “I am delighted at the enthusiasm the children showed for all the tasks and we look forward to welcoming the school back in the future.”",year pupil from tollesbury primary school in essex recently got handson experience of a career in engineering at a special event hosted by a local engineering company familyrun gibbon engineering group welcomed child to it office and workshop a part of it year of engineering partnership the year of engineering scheme is a governmentled initiative to encourage young people to consider a career in engineering and gibbon arranged a number of activity designed to give the child a taste of the variety and challenge offered by the industry after being shown round gibbon workshop and seeing engineer building control panel and repairing electric motor the child were divided into two group for the four activity the first activity saw the child identify place within the home where electric motor and pump are used following this the pupil built a motorised model car in small group which required them to follow instruction and work a a team the child also got the opportunity to build their own electric motor with a battery paper clip magnet and copper wire finally they created a simple water pump from a bottle straw and a balloon a task which wa so popular that the school is planning to demonstrate it to it early year pupil once all activity had been completed the child were presented with certificate and goody bag before returning to school tollesbury primary school class teacher amanda tomkins said i wa in awe of the activities… the child relished the opportunity to get hand on and creative i must commend all the staff for their patience enthusiasm and willingness to help the child gibbon marketing manager nadya damhar arranged the event and said i am delighted at the enthusiasm the child showed for all the task and we look forward to welcoming the school back in the future,"['built', 'workshop', 'model', 'young', 'school', 'engineer', 'engineering', 'manager', 'class', 'teacher']"

The performances are part of multi-disciplinary project run by the Holocaust Educational Trust (HET), with support from the Association of Jewish Refugees, entitled “Stories from Willesden Lane”. The initiative has seen young people across the capital learn about and reflect on Britain’s response to the plight of the Jews of Europe and will ensure that the stories of the children who rebuilt their lives in Britain.
“The Children of Willesden Lane” tells the story of Lisa Jura who was brought to England on the Kindertransport. Lisa was forced to flee her home in Vienna as a young girl and rebuild her life in London during World War Two. The show was performed by concert pianist Mona Golabek, daughter of Lisa Jura, who has previously told her mother’s story to 250,000 school children in the US but never before in the UK.
The performances took place at the Westminster Methodist Central Hall, with schools invited to attend one of five shows across the 11th and 12th June.
Londoners were also treated to a rare, one-off gala performance of the show on Sunday 10th June, as Mona Golabek retraced her mother’s steps and took to the stage in Wigmore Hall, Marylebone.
Kindertransport refugees attended all of the performances, including Harry Bibring BEM (who did a live webcast for the Trust to over 8,000 students), and Kurt Marx and Hennie Franks who both lived at Willesden Hostel at the same time as Lisa Jura. Vera Schaufeld and Eve Willman attended school performances whilst Bob and Ann Kirk attended the Gala performance.
Karen Pollock MBE, Chief Executive of HET commented: “We have all heard stories about the Holocaust but there is nothing like hearing from those who came to Britain on the Kindertransport, in their own words.” Ms Pollock continued. “This is why we have given students the chance to hear these stories first hand through Lisa Jura’s story.”
Ms Pollock added: “Our job is to educate, raise awareness and remember. The Kindertransport is part of our history and we hope that by understanding one girl’s story, students will draw relevance for their own lives and the world we live in today.”

"Primary school crowned winners of UK reading challenge and receive £5,000 RRP worth of books – Education Today","['Competition', 'Literacy', 'News', 'Primary schools']","June 14, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/primary-school-crowned-winners-of-uk-reading-challenge-and-receive-5000-rrp-worth-of-books/,"Pupils at Rosh Pinah Primary School in Edgware received £5,000 RRP worth of books after topping the leaderboard in a competition that saw 200,000 children across the UK try to read as much as possible over a month. Councillor Brian Gordon and Councillor Sarah Wardle joined the celebration in the school assembly with staff and pupils on Monday 11th June 2018.
The 100 Million Minutes Reading Challenge, from award-winning education charity, Achievement for All, and leading bookseller, Book People, engaged children and young people with reading while they collectively read 100,019,560 minutes in schools, early years settings, homes, libraries and community groups throughout Britain.
However, it was pupils at Rosh Pinah Primary School who came out on top after reading the most minutes over the month of March, placing them ahead of any other participating school. They received their £5,000 RRP worth of book titles from Book People at a celebratory in-school event where challenge mascot Milli the Millipede joined Achievement for All representatives in congratulating the winning staff and pupils.
Speaking about their achievement, Headteacher Jill Howson said: “I am overwhelmed and extremely proud of all of our pupils who worked so hard during March to do as much extra reading as they could whilst participating in the 100 Million Minutes Reading Challenge! Out of thousands of schools, we came first place!”
Librarian, Katie Presser who led the school’s involvement in the 100 Million Minutes Reading Challenge, said: “At Rosh Pinah we promote “Reading for Pleasure” on a daily basis and I am delighted that as a whole school working as a team, we achieved such an amazing result.”
Adding their congratulations, Sarah Walden, Group Buying & Merchandising Director at Book People, who sponsored the challenge said: “We’re absolutely delighted to see that so many children have taken part in the 100 Million Minutes Reading Challenge this year. To see such dedication across the country is truly remarkable and we are proud to award £5,000 RRP worth of books to Rosh Pinah Primary School. We hope that these books continue to inspire and captivate these budding readers. Well done to everyone who took part in this incredible initiative.”
As part of the 100 Million Minutes initiative, exciting events and activities including reading power hours and a Q&A with Hollywood actor Lennie James have been taking place across the month – all with the aim to inspire children and young people to read more regularly and understand the possibilities that literacy can unlock.
Functional illiteracy costs the UK economy £36 billion a year, with one in four working-age adults struggling to read and write, according to the latest report from the World Literacy Foundation. Research from the Fair Education Alliance also revealed that that up to three in five children from socio-economic disadvantage leave primary school in this country without achieving the expected standard of reading, with the effect on their self-confidence and job opportunities long-lasting.
Professor Sonia Blandford, CEO at Achievement for All – the charity that heads-up the initiative and works to improve outcomes for all children and young people who are vulnerable to underachievement said: “Literacy levels are one of the greatest drivers of social inequality in the UK today. It is unacceptable that so many children and young people feel their potential is being thwarted because of their background or circumstances.
“We are delighted that so many schools, parents, carers and community groups across the UK have taken part in our reading challenge and joined the campaign to build a fairer society by engaging young people with literacy. Imagine what worlds have been explored and possibilities unlocked in 100 million minutes of reading? Rosh Pinah Primary School really have lead the way here and I urge everyone to think about how they can support the children in their communities to become lifetime readers, achieve and lead happy lives long after the challenge has ended.”

Schools join research into the effect of air pollution on children’s health – Education Today,"['News', 'Primary schools', 'Social issues']","June 12, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/schools-join-research-into-the-effect-of-air-pollution-on-childrens-health/,"Over 3,000 primary school children in polluted areas of London and Luton will have their lung health monitored over a four-year period in a new international study led by Queen Mary University of London, launched by the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.
The CHILL study (Children’s Health in London & Luton) is funded by the National Institute for Health Research. It will test whether policies to improve air quality, such as London’s new Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ), are associated with improved growth of children’s lungs and reduced chest symptoms. Researchers from the University of Bedfordshire and Queen Mary University of London are currently recruiting schools to take part.
Children are especially vulnerable to traffic pollution, with evidence showing stunted growth of children’s lungs in polluted areas worldwide, leaving them at risk of lifelong breathing disorders and earlier death. Pollution also triggers asthma, asthma attacks and chest infections.
Lead researcher Professor Chris Griffiths from Queen Mary University of London said: “Air pollution in UK towns and cities is a major health problem, and this study is the first in the world to test the impact of targeted pollution control measures on the long-term lung growth and health of children.
“Low emission zones are being promoted as the best way to tackle traffic pollution and are common across Europe. If ambitious enough they can improve air quality, but we don’t know whether they benefit health. This study will tell us whether this type of low emission zone improves children’s lung growth and development, and whether they should be implemented in towns and cities in the UK and globally.”
Bavaani Nanthabalan, Headteacher at Netley Primary School in the London Borough of Camden which is taking part in the study, said: “Air pollution is a major worry for parents in London. We’re delighted to be helping to answer these important questions about children’s health and development.”
London has some of the worst air pollution in Europe and the upcoming ULEZ is the central component of the city’s air quality strategy. Starting in April 2019, the introduction of the zone provides a unique opportunity for researchers to test how effectively the policy reduces air pollution, improves lung growth and reduces the number of chest infections and asthma attacks. The researchers will also find out if improving air quality encourages children to spend more time exercising outdoors.
The researchers will compare the health of two large groups of primary school children (aged 6–9 years). 1,500 children will come from central London primary schools where the ULEZ will be implemented, and 1,500 children from primary schools in Luton, a large town close to London with a broadly similar population and air quality.
The children will have an annual health check for four years that includes measuring the size and function of their lungs by blowing into a machine called a spirometer. They can also wear an activity monitor. With the family’s permission, the team will also check children’s health records to find out how often they’ve had respiratory infections, visited a GP or A&E, or been admitted to hospital for chest problems.
The team will monitor accurately the air pollution to which each child has been exposed over the four years, including exposures to a range of key pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulates such as PM2.5 and PM10.
Professor Frank Kelly from King’s College London said: “London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone is a bold and world-leading initiative with the potential for big impacts on London’s air quality and the health of London’s children. It is important that it’s rigorously evaluated.”
Professor Gurch Randhawa from the University of Bedfordshire said: “We urgently need to know whether our public health policies on air pollution are effective. This timely study enables us to measure accurately their impact on children’s health.”
Professor Martin White, Director of the NIHR Public Health Research Programme said: “NIHR funds research to evaluate major policies that may have an impact on population health. The London Ultra Low Emissions Zone is just such a policy and this research should help inform future action to tackle poor air quality.”
The CHILL collaboration brings together experts from six globally leading research centres – Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, MRC and Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma, NIHR Health Protection Unit in the Health Impact of Environmental Hazards, MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health, UKCRC Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), Cambridge, and The Keck School of

New teaching resources from Plastic Oceans for World Oceans Day 2018 – Education Today,"['Environmental Focus', 'KS3', 'KS4', 'News', 'Recycling', 'Resources', 'Teaching resources']","June 8, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-teaching-resources-from-plastic-oceans-for-world-oceans-day-2018/,"A unique set of teaching materials, designed to weave education against single-use plastic into the national curriculum for 11-16 year olds, has been launched today, World Oceans Day, June 8th, by Plastic Oceans UK, in a bid to educate and empower children to become ambassadors for change.
Plastic Oceans UK is the team behind the ground-breaking film A Plastic Ocean, which first raised awareness of the terrible consequences single-use plastic was having on the environment when it was released in 2016. As part of the film’s legacy programme, one of the film researchers, Jessica Hickie, has spent the last two years developing the ‘Wave One’ lesson plans, with materials that can seamlessly fit into seven IGCSE syllabus subjects.
Jessica says, “As a science teacher, I know delivering the national curriculum is very pressurised so there is little or no spare time to prepare materials to teach extra-curricular subjects, regardless of how important or passionate you are about them. For this teaching material to make an impact it was imperative that it could replace existing lessons by delivering the required outcomes stated in the national curriculum.
“Each lesson is differentiated to three different learning levels and contains the terminology for each target age group so there is no additional work required by the teachers. We have been successfully trialling the material in Brannel School, St Austell, and the response from both teachers and students has been overwhelmingly positive.”
The new Teaching materials are geared towards Key Stages 3 and 4, and are available to download for free from June 8th at www.plasticoceans.uk.
The packs are currently available in English and French, and can be used in Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Geography, Maths, English Language and Design Technology. Each pack contains the following:
•Lesson plan with cross curricular opportunities
•Resource information
•PowerPoint presentation (most with film clips included)
•Activity sheets/information for the students
Jo Ruxton, founder and CEO of Plastic Oceans UK and co-producer of A Plastic Ocean says, “Since the release of A Plastic Ocean, we have taken forward our legacy work to raise awareness, and form action-focused programmes. Our film was the first tool of our global education work and it has already opened the hearts and minds of people all over the world and from all walks of life. Our plan is to perpetuate and spread that message through our work in schools and communities to turn the messages of the film into action and provide the wave of change we need.
Jo added: “What sets us apart as an organisation is that we have a global view of the issue and have worked with scientists for eight years, out on the ocean and in the laboratories. We have witnessed and documented the disturbing consequences of ingested plastic in seabirds, turtles, marine mammals and fish. And we want to pass that knowledge to as many as we can.”

April Caldwell, the team’s teacher at Bearsden Academy who led the project, said: “We’re delighted with the team’s fantastic achievement at bringing the create sport project to life. Go4SET is a fantastic competition and helps raise awareness of the exciting careers children can have in STEM-based fields.”
Steven Don, Head of Local Authority Contracts Scotland for Viridor, the main sponsor of Go4SET across Scotland said: “As Scotland’s leading recycling, renewable energy and sustainable waste partner working with 96% of local authorities we are keen to encourage young people to get involved in energy management.
“We are delighted to support the Go4SET programme across Scotland, challenging young people to think about their environment and the future. Like Viridor, these young people are committed to their environment and conscious of how they utilise resources.”
Helen Anderson, Scotland Director for competition-organisers EDT, said: “Go4SET encourages young pupils of today to be the engineers and scientists of tomorrow. It also helps them develop skills in team working, communication, report writing and problems solving – all essential skills in today’s world of work”.
Jamie Hepburn MSP, the Minister for Employability and Training said: “It is fantastic so many young people were involved in the Go4SET Competition, giving them the chance to use their creativity and imagination while learning important new skills. These are exactly the types of projects that can encourage and inspire young people to take an interest in STEM subjects like science, engineering and mathematics and that can help us ensure our future workforce is well-equipped and supported to make the most of the fast-paced technological changes around us. Through our STEM strategy we want more schools and colleges to work together to bring such challenges to young people.”
Webster’s High School, from Kirriemuir was highly commended for their project while Hillpark Secondary School from Glasgow received the Pupil’s Prize.
Go4SET is a national programme which is part of the EDT’s continuum of programmes aimed at stimulating young people’s interest in STEM at a key stage in their education.
The annual competition encourages pupils to gain an understanding of how STEM is central to the world as we know it, giving an insight into the future careers they could take advantage of.
With predicted industry shortages of around 87,000 positions per year in STEM careers across the UK, it is vitally important to make STEM attractive and accessible to the next generation of scientists and engineers.
Organisers cite Go4SET as one effective way of providing young people with the experience of working with industry, helping to enthuse and inspire them to consider a STEM career.
Other organisations which supported this year’s teams were Heineken, Liberty Steel, Aecom, KCP, Qualitrol, Devro, Bear Scotland, Alex Begg, Stork and Network Rail.

Focus-Trust celebrates music with whole-trust Music Festival – Education Today,"['Academies', 'MATs', 'Music, Stage & Drama', 'News', 'Primary schools']","June 5, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/focus-trust-celebrates-music-with-whole-trust-music-festival/,"Children and staff from fifteen academies within Focus-Trust – a charitable primary multi-academy trust based in the North West of England – have participated in a Music Festival in celebration of music designed to showcase the musical talents of their pupils and encourage further interest in the arts.
Led by the Head of Music at Thornhill Junior and Infant School, Peter Simons, the Music Festival brought together children from fifteen Focus-Trust academies to perform a choir or instrumental piece at the Sheridan Suite in Manchester.
Over 380 children in total performed songs including I’m Still Standing by Elton John, Hound Dog by Elvis Presley and The Tide is High by Blondie, with Thornhill’s ‘Rock School’ band acting as the backing music for the event.
The Rock School band also performed A Voice We All Share – written by Peter Simons about the core values of the Focus-Trust; fair, care, share and dare.
Music and creative subjects are high on the agenda for Thornhill, which incorporates both singing and instrument lessons such as the recorder and the ukulele into its curriculum, providing each pupil with at least one hour of music lessons each week.
Key to a ‘well-rounded education’, Peter hopes that other primary schools throughout the UK will follow suit and maintain music as a core curriculum requirement.
He said: “I was delighted to see the range of musical talent on display at the Focus-Trust Music Festival, where children from all fifteen academies within the trust joined together for collaborative renditions of popular songs.
“As a music teacher it’s great to see children performing with such confidence, and many of the students at Thornhill who have excelled musically continue their musical interest way into secondary school, and some have even progressed to further education to continue their study of music!”
The Focus-Trust CEO, Helen Rowland, said: “Lost in the debate around SATs and performance tables is the importance of a child’s social, emotional and mental health development.
“Here at Focus-Trust we believe that music and the arts can help children to develop a wide range of skills that will be useful to them in later life, notably collaboration, creativity, self-expression and control, which is why we encourage a broad and balanced curriculum in all of our academies.”",child and staff from fifteen academy within focustrust a charitable primary multiacademy trust based in the north west of england have participated in a music festival in celebration of music designed to showcase the musical talent of their pupil and encourage further interest in the art led by the head of music at thornhill junior and infant school peter simon the music festival brought together child from fifteen focustrust academy to perform a choir or instrumental piece at the sheridan suite in manchester over child in total performed song including im still standing by elton john hound dog by elvis presley and the tide is high by blondie with thornhills rock school band acting a the backing music for the event the rock school band also performed a voice we all share written by peter simon about the core value of the focustrust fair care share and dare music and creative subject are high on the agenda for thornhill which incorporates both singing and instrument lesson such a the recorder and the ukulele into it curriculum providing each pupil with at least one hour of music lesson each week key to a wellrounded education peter hope that other primary school throughout the uk will follow suit and maintain music a a core curriculum requirement he said i wa delighted to see the range of musical talent on display at the focustrust music festival where child from all fifteen academy within the trust joined together for collaborative rendition of popular song a a music teacher it great to see child performing with such confidence and many of the student at thornhill who have excelled musically continue their musical interest way into secondary school and some have even progressed to further education to continue their study of music the focustrust ceo helen rowland said lost in the debate around sat and performance table is the importance of a child social emotional and mental health development here at focustrust we believe that music and the art can help child to develop a wide range of skill that will be useful to them in later life notably collaboration creativity selfexpression and control which is why we encourage a broad and balanced curriculum in all of our academy,"['presley', 'band', 'teacher', 'celebration', 'performing', 'elvis', 'musical', 'festival', 'ukulele', 'choir']"
"7,000 volunteering hours spent helping children become more confident readers across England every week – Education Today","['Charity', 'Literacy', 'News', 'Volunteering']","June 4, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/7000-volunteering-hours-spent-helping-children-become-more-confident-readers-across-england-every-week/,"Over 7,000 hours are volunteered every week to help children become confident and able readers across primary schools and early years settings in England, according to children’s reading charity Beanstalk.
The organisation trains and supports reading helpers to provide one-to-one support to children aged 3 to 13 in a variety of ways, turning them into confident, passionate and able readers. In the last school year the charity helped over 11,000 children across England, in over 1,400 schools, with the help of over 3,000 reading helpers, ensuring children have the skills and confidence to reach their true potential.
Ginny Lunn, Chief Executive Officer at Beanstalk, says: “Reading is a fundamental skill in early education and, once grasped, provides a springboard to new opportunities and possibilities. By working with children who have either fallen behind with their reading, lack confidence, or struggle with their fluency or comprehension, our reading helpers can make a significant difference to their future prospects. This Volunteer’s Week we want to highlight the valuable hours spent by our trained reading helpers who help deliver Beanstalk’s reading programmes in a range of educational settings across England. The work our reading helpers do makes a meaningful difference to children across the country – thank you to all our volunteers and supporters!”
Each Beanstalk volunteer is trained to recognise what challenges each child faces and tailors their sessions to support each child. Clare has been a Beanstalk 321 volunteer for three years and visits a local primary school twice a week supporting three children for 30 minutes:
“I was a nurse a very long time ago and then a Teaching Assistant in a special school and mainstream schools. I became a volunteer after searching online for ways of helping disadvantaged children. The best parts are laughing with the children and the breakthrough moments. If you look for the small changes; not just with reading, but with eye contact, concentration, a smile, a moment of relaxation, there are breakthrough moments every week. Knowing that the children look forward to me going in motivates me to stay, as does the caring atmosphere in school, particularly from the Inclusion Team. To anyone considering volunteering I would encourage it. There is training and support. Remember, it’s all about the child, follow their interests.”

From 2020, Fareham College will offer T-levels in a number of subjects, including Education and Childcare, Digital (ICT) and Design, Surveying and Planning pathways. The two-year courses will feature more teaching hours than most current technical programmes and include a three-month work placement.
It is hoped that T-levels will become one of the three main choices for FE study, alongside A-levels and apprenticeships, as well as help to simplify vocational training in England, close skills gaps for employers and make access to the job market easier for learners.
Nigel Duncan, Principal of Fareham College said:
“Fareham College is committed to the development of high quality technical and professional skills provision at all levels and is proud to have been selected to pilot the first round of T-level qualifications commencing in 2020.
“We recognise the importance of this initiative and applaud the Government’s foresight in ensuring the availability of high quality level 3 technical education and skills provision that will prepare our students for outstanding careers in technical occupations both now and in the future.”

Pupils across the country set to attempt new Guinness World Record to raise awareness about environmental impact of plastic – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'Environmental Focus', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Recycling', 'Social issues']","May 29, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/pupils-across-the-country-set-to-attempt-new-guinness-world-record-to-raise-awareness-about-environmental-impact-of-plastic/,"More than 6,000 primary school pupils at schools across the country are currently signed up to take part in the Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge. The pupils’ aim is to set a new Guinness World Record to highlight the impact plastic waste is having on oceans and the environment.
The Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge is an attempt to set a Guinness World Record for the simultaneous launch of a flotilla of plastic boats. The boats will be made out of recycled plastic bottles by primary school children across the country. The boats themselves will then be recycled after the attempt has been made, showing the importance of reusing and recycling materials.
The Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge is intended to demonstrate the impact that plastic bottle waste can have on the environment. Participating schools have access to a hub of resources for teachers to support learning centred around the issues of plastic pollution in the oceans, the environment, recycling and the circular economy and all educators are invited to contribute or use the resources available to support their school’s curriculum.
The Guinness World Record attempt follows a similar attempt achieved, in the development of the project, by the pupils at St. James’ Church of England Academy in Bournemouth, with the support of the Queen Mary Sailing Club. 330 plastic bottle boats were successfully launched, officially setting a new world record, and recycled. What began in one school has now been taken up by over 60 schools, with more than 6,000 pupils and over 300 teachers involved. Organisers are anticipating many more to follow.
Jeremy Payne, Principal of St. James’ Church of England Academy in Bournemouth, said:
“I’ve been thrilled by the huge response we’ve had to the Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge, with schools up and down the country asking to take part. Young people in school today will bear the brunt of the future environmental impact of waste plastic, so it’s essential that they learn to take responsibility for their own plastic use. We have seen first-hand how passionate the children become about this subject when they really see the consequences of our actions.”
“The Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge offers an exciting way to simultaneously unite schools in plastic education and also attempt to set a new Guinness World Record. We all have an important role to play in looking after the future of the planet, and the Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge teaches that every one of us must play our part in combatting this global issue.”
Speaking about the challenge, Revered John Pares, Priest in Charge of St James and St Clements Churches in the Diocese of Winchester, and governor of St. James’ Church of England Academy, said:
“This project is a wonderful, inventive way of encouraging young people to take responsibility for their environment. I think we are all increasingly aware of the damage that plastic is doing to the oceans and our coastline, and it is vital that we take action now to preserve and defend all of God’s creation.
“Care for the environment is fundamental to Christian faith, as we seek to protect the gifts that God has given us and create more sustainable communities. The Plastic Bottle Boat Challenge, which began at St. James’ Church of England Academy, is now raising awareness and inspiring environmental responsibility in school children across the county.”
The Guinness World Record Attempt is taking place on Wednesday 27th June, 2018 at 14:00 BST. Simultaneously, at multiple locations around the country, thousands of plastic bottle boats will be launched, retrieved and recycled.
The idea for the challenge originated at Queen Mary Sailing Cub hoping to connect with local schools and has now been supported by the Heathrow Community Fund with an initial grant of £17,000 to enable the production of a website to scale the project nationally.
Tony Bishop, Club Secretary at Queen Mary Sailing Club said:
“It’s overwhelming the amount of support we have received for the challenge, the response from schools and teachers has been fantastic. Sign up will remain open right up to the day of the attempt and there is a great team behind the challenge to support anyone wishing to get involved.”

Woodland learning course for children to branch out – Education Today,"['Early years', 'KS1', 'News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'Teaching resources']","May 25, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/woodland-learning-course-for-children-to-branch-out/,"Forestry Commission Scotland’s (FCS) Forest Kindergarten training has received full SQA accreditation, meaning it could be rolled out to educational institutions across Scotland as early as August.
The Forest Kindergarten programme was developed by FCS in 2009 and is designed to equip early years teachers with the knowledge, understanding and skills to support children in learning through play in local woodlands and green spaces.
The course includes activities such as exploring for bugs, tracking animals, arts and crafts, den building, and learning about the dangers and risks to look out for in a woodland setting.
Research has shown that play and learning in woodland and greenspaces leads to a range of benefits for children’s development, including better concentration, better communication skills, greater stamina, improved balance and coordination, increased confidence and appreciation of the outdoors.
Sally York, education policy adviser at Forestry Commission Scotland, said: “FCS’s partnership with the SQA has been invaluable for accrediting the Forest Kindergarten course. With it becoming a nationally recognised qualification, this will add value to the course for early years practitioners. It will benefit them and the children they work with, in that the practitioner will have a more in depth understanding and appreciation of early years pedagogy and play outdoors.”
FCS is seeking colleges and educational institutions from around Scotland to deliver the newly accredited Forest Kindergarten course as part of their early years curriculum. The programme is currently being delivered by West College and has been completed by almost 200 students.
Geraldine Miller, curriculum quality leader childhood practice at West College, said: “We have been embedding the three-day Forest Kindergarten programme in our course delivery since 2014 and are very fortunate to have the support of FCS in its roll out for early years students. The Kindergarten programme thus far has engaged students and staff in practical hands-on learning, designed to equip them with the skills needed to make the most of the outdoor space available. This allows children the freedom to play, explore and learn without limits.
“With the Scottish Government 1140 hours expansion programme underway it is important for early years practitioners to embrace the possibilities within the boundaries of their settings. As a college we are delighted that SQA and FCS have this new National Work-based Award, which recognises the value of on and off site outdoor space as an integral part of the learning processes for pre-school children.”

Old Trafford Community Academy creates memorial meadow in memory of victims of the Manchester Arena attack – Education Today,"['Citizenship', 'Community engagement', 'News', 'Primary schools']","May 23, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/old-trafford-community-academy-creates-memorial-meadow-in-memory-of-victims-of-the-manchester-arena-attack/,"Children at a local primary academy have paid tribute to the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing by creating a memorial meadow garden and a mural depicting the history of Manchester.
Located just a few miles from the site of the tragic attack, Old Trafford Community Academy’s 425 pupils were ‘deeply affected’ by the tragic attack which took place on 22nd May last year.
Marking the anniversary, the school also came together for a special assembly and to make bee friendship bracelets – the symbol for Manchester.
Vice Principal, Andrew Marlow, said it was important for all of the pupils to mark the anniversary by remembering those who had lost their lives and to remind themselves of the importance of ‘standing together in solidarity’.
He said: “We are situated very close to the arena, and the horrendous attack which took place last May affected us all very deeply. For a long time after, the community experienced a high police presence whilst investigations took place, which caused many children and parents to feel unsettled and on edge.
“We therefore felt it was important to mark the occasion and remember those who sadly lost their lives by doing something that brought us all together as one. Something that reminded us that we have each other and that we are stronger standing together in solidarity.
“The first anniversary of the attack will be an intensely emotional time for us all, but our memorial garden and our Manchester Wall, which will be created on the anniversary, will be a daily reminder to children and staff of those who died, those who lost loved ones, and those who were left physically or mentally injured.”

A coming together of cultures at Durham School – Education Today,"['Citizenship', 'Educational event', 'News']","May 22, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/a-coming-together-of-cultures-at-durham-school/,"Durham School pupils and children from Russia have been exploring each other’s cultures.
Youngsters from St Petersburg and Moscow spent a busy week in Durham with their counterparts from Bow School, which included a ‘Mini World Cup’ ahead of the real thing in Russia this summer.
During their stay the 25 Russian children (13 from Moscow and 12 from St Petersburg), aged between 8 and 11, took part in lessons and activities at Bow, Durham School.
The visitors hosted assemblies with the help of pupils at the independent prep school and the cultural exchange finished with an outstanding performance of young Bow School dancers together with their new Russian friends.
Meanwhile the Russian teachers delivered a Russian Folk Workshop for the British pupils teaching Russian dance, songs and making ancient Russian children’s games.
Sally Harrod, Headmistress of Bow, Durham School, explained: “The children had an amazing and enriching week. They made some fantastic friendships and were able to find out about the Russian culture through real-life and first-hand experience.
“It was very interesting for our pupils to find out more about what school is like in Russia and they picked up some of the Russian language during the week, which they demonstrated wonderfully in the assemblies.
“We look forward to the children returning to our school next year.”
During their stay, the children were also treated to a performance of Charlotte’s Web, which came courtesy of theatre-in-education specialists, M&M Theatrical Productions. The main purpose of the Russian group visit was to take part in an International Youth Primary Project and to collaborate with young people from Durham.
This project allowed the children from Bow, Durham School to have a personal experience of meeting and learning with youngsters from Russia and to broaden their international, interpersonal skills.
The visit was organised by Most Education, the North-East hub for intercultural relations and educational opportunities.
It actively promotes youth exchange projects, teachers’ professional development, school partnerships, international learning and cultural experiences and communities alliances.
Both Russian schools are UNESCO Associated schools and, also International Baccalaureate schools.
Most Education founder, Lana Briton said: “This project was specially designed to give our young primary children a personal experience and the confidence to work in international context by developing interpersonal and communicational skills from earlier ages.
“We are keen to further promote the North East of England to a worldwide audience for future tourism and educational opportunities.”
Agata Mukhina, a pupil from St.Petersburg, gave her verdict on her visit. She said: “It was a magic time. I never realised that English children and teachers are so kind and friendly to us. I am hoping to keep in touch with my new friend from Durham.”
The children have been encouraged to stay in touch with their new friends, by hand-writing letters which Lana says she’ll be happy to deliver back and forth.",durham school pupil and child from russia have been exploring each others culture youngster from st petersburg and moscow spent a busy week in durham with their counterpart from bow school which included a mini world cup ahead of the real thing in russia this summer during their stay the russian child from moscow and from st petersburg aged between and took part in lesson and activity at bow durham school the visitor hosted assembly with the help of pupil at the independent prep school and the cultural exchange finished with an outstanding performance of young bow school dancer together with their new russian friend meanwhile the russian teacher delivered a russian folk workshop for the british pupil teaching russian dance song and making ancient russian childrens game sally harrod headmistress of bow durham school explained the child had an amazing and enriching week they made some fantastic friendship and were able to find out about the russian culture through reallife and firsthand experience it wa very interesting for our pupil to find out more about what school is like in russia and they picked up some of the russian language during the week which they demonstrated wonderfully in the assembly we look forward to the child returning to our school next year during their stay the child were also treated to a performance of charlotte web which came courtesy of theatreineducation specialist mm theatrical production the main purpose of the russian group visit wa to take part in an international youth primary project and to collaborate with young people from durham this project allowed the child from bow durham school to have a personal experience of meeting and learning with youngster from russia and to broaden their international interpersonal skill the visit wa organised by most education the northeast hub for intercultural relation and educational opportunity it actively promotes youth exchange project teacher professional development school partnership international learning and cultural experience and community alliance both russian school are unesco associated school and also international baccalaureate school most education founder lana briton said this project wa specially designed to give our young primary child a personal experience and the confidence to work in international context by developing interpersonal and communicational skill from earlier age we are keen to further promote the north east of england to a worldwide audience for future tourism and educational opportunity agata mukhina a pupil from gave her verdict on her visit she said it wa a magic time i never realised that english child and teacher are so kind and friendly to u i am hoping to keep in touch with my new friend from durham the child have been encouraged to stay in touch with their new friend by handwriting letter which lana say shell be happy to deliver back and forth,"['firsthand', 'reallife', 'moscow', 'dance', 'russian', 'headmistress', 'dancer', 'teacher', 'russia', 'theatreineducation']"
Leading charity launches new service to help schools support health and wellbeing – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Social issues']","May 18, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/leading-charity-launches-new-service-to-help-schools-support-health-and-wellbeing/,"Leading charity Aquarius has launched a brand new service to help schools utilise the pupil premium to provide specialist support for young people affected by mental health issues and problems arising from alcohol, drug and gambling misuse in the home.
Figures from NHS Trusts across England reveal that over 100,000 children were turned away from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) between 2015 and 2017, with an average of 150 pupils a day not getting the support they need. This research is supported by statistics from the Care Quality Commission Report 2017 which shows that those accepted were still waiting up to 18 months to be treated.
With no waiting lists, Aquarius Life provides early intervention and multi-disciplinary behavioural support to build resilience in young people, improve life chances, reduce absenteeism and exclusion rates, and improve results for secondary schools. Specialist services include one-to-one and group support, counselling services and prevention and information workshops, which can be funded using the pupil premium.
Aquarius Life also contributes to PHSE education programmes by covering topics in the core themes of ‘health and wellbeing’ and ‘living in the wider world’ and also helps schools and colleges demonstrate their commitment to SMSC development and meeting the SMSC Quality Mark.
Recent research by Aquarius Life also reveals that 83% of all employees in the education sector have experienced stress or pressure that they are struggling to cope with. To support these employees, Aquarius Life also provides important training and CPD for teaching staff, staff wellbeing programmes, policy development for schools and support for parents and carers, as well as coordination and referral services between other agencies.
Annette Fleming, CEO of Aquarius, comments: “Thousands of children every year are not getting the help they desperately need and teachers are struggling too. That’s why we have launched Aquarius Life to help schools provide the right support, at the right time, to those most in need.
“We take a partnership approach to improving lives and life chances by providing immediate access to a range of specialist services that meet the specific needs of the individual and the school. And, as a charity, we are able to help teachers maximise the available pupil premium by providing costs effective solutions.”
Aquarius Life is part of Aquarius, a charity that has been providing specialist support services relating to alcohol, drugs, gambling and mental health to children, young people and professionals for over 40 years.

Fantastic free World Cup teaching resources to inspire pupils’ writing – Education Today,"['KS2', 'Literacy', 'News', 'Resources', 'Sport & Play', 'Teaching resources']","May 16, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/fantastic-free-world-cup-teaching-resources-to-inspire-pupils-writing/,"The National Literacy Trust and Walker Books have teamed up to launch a series of fantastic free teaching resources, posters and bookmarks to inspire Key Stage 2 pupils to get writing ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.
Alex Bellos and Ben Lyttleton, the authors behind the best-selling Football School books, have set pupils an exciting writing challenge! In the style of their Football School books – which are set in a fictitious school where the lessons are dedicated to all things football – pupils are challenged to write a lesson for their favourite subject, giving it a football twist!
Pupils are tasked with uncovering the most entertaining facts and funniest stories about football in relation to their chosen subject. When do footballers go to the toilet? Can you play football on Mars? What were Henry VIII’s football boots like?
Pupils are also encouraged to include illustrations, jokes and diagrams in their lessons – which should culminate in a quiz designed to outsmart their classmates.
Jonathan Douglas, Director of the National Literacy Trust, said: “You don’t need to be a football fanatic to take inspiration from the World Cup. The tournament brings together such an incredible range of nations, each with their own fascinating history, culture and traditions – and football super stars, of course! These resources promise to spark children’s creativity and nurture a love of writing, as pupils are inspired to become journalists, statisticians, historians, explorers and even musicians in their quest to write their very own World Cup Football School lesson.”

"Epsom College bids to become the world’s first school team to sail an autonomous boat 4,000 miles across the Atlantic – Education Today","['Competition', 'Educational event', 'News', 'STEM']","May 14, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/epsom-college-bids-to-become-the-worlds-first-school-team-to-sail-an-autonomous-boat-4000-miles-across-the-atlantic/,"Epsom College is in a race to become the first team to sail an autonomous boat across the Atlantic. The global challenge, which has been running since 2010, features teams from Universities, Engineering Institutions and the US and French Naval Academies, but Epsom College stands alone as the only school in the world to compete.
In June, 10 sixth-form pupils will launch their carefully-crafted vessel ‘That’ll Do 2’ from the south coast of England, in the hope that it will complete the treacherous 4,000 mile transatlantic voyage to the east coast of Antigua.
Led by Jamie Styles, Epsom’s Head of Chemistry, and Chris Telfer, Head of Physics, The Microtransat Challenge has brought together students from the Mathematics, Geography, Science and Computing Departments, who have been working on the design of their boat since September 2016.
The initiative is part of the school’s STEM offering, which allows students to explore aspects of science, technology, engineering and maths outside of the curriculum. The club’s aim is to allow students to gain teamwork and leadership skills while working collaboratively to solve problems big and small.
The boat’s complex components include a USB datalogger which will be used by the team back in Epsom to track ‘That’ll Do 2’s’ voyage across the Atlantic. The device, which is self-designed and programmed, weighs just 100 grams and logs latitude, longitude, altitude and temperature data. The boat itself uses a GPS module to calculate its position and to determine a safe passage to the next waypoint. This information is stored in its memory, using software the students have written themselves.
The boat also has the ability to transmit its location every hour, from anywhere in the world, directly to its own Twitter feed, via the Iridium satellite network.
To date there have been 24 Microtransat attempts, but none has been successful. The best effort so far came from Offshore Sensing, whose 2m boat travelled 68 days before being picked up by a fishing boat. Epsom’s first attempt, in the summer of 2016, received support from the Royal Navy and reached a commendable 374 km in 4 days and 21 hours before being recovered ashore.
This year’s team is well aware of the size of the task and their chances of success given that a number of better-funded and resourced universities have already tried and failed.
Mr Styles said: “We have a monumental challenge ahead of us, but we are determined to produce a vessel that has the potential to reach the finish line. The biggest threats we face are from external factors which are largely out of our control; fishing nets, adverse weather and larger boats.  However, we aim to stay one step ahead with a carefully plotted route and a robust boat that is fit to face the elements.”
If successful, ‘That’ll Do 2’ should arrive in Antigua approximately six months’ after launch.",epsom college is in a race to become the first team to sail an autonomous boat across the atlantic the global challenge which ha been running since feature team from university engineering institution and the u and french naval academy but epsom college stand alone a the only school in the world to compete in june sixthform pupil will launch their carefullycrafted vessel thatll do from the south coast of england in the hope that it will complete the treacherous mile transatlantic voyage to the east coast of antigua led by jamie style epsoms head of chemistry and chris telfer head of physic the microtransat challenge ha brought together student from the mathematics geography science and computing department who have been working on the design of their boat since september the initiative is part of the school stem offering which allows student to explore aspect of science technology engineering and math outside of the curriculum the club aim is to allow student to gain teamwork and leadership skill while working collaboratively to solve problem big and small the boat complex component include a usb datalogger which will be used by the team back in epsom to track thatll do s voyage across the atlantic the device which is selfdesigned and programmed weighs just gram and log latitude longitude altitude and temperature data the boat itself us a gps module to calculate it position and to determine a safe passage to the next waypoint this information is stored in it memory using software the student have written themselves the boat also ha the ability to transmit it location every hour from anywhere in the world directly to it own twitter feed via the iridium satellite network to date there have been microtransat attempt but none ha been successful the best effort so far came from offshore sensing whose m boat travelled day before being picked up by a fishing boat epsoms first attempt in the summer of received support from the royal navy and reached a commendable km in day and hour before being recovered ashore this year team is well aware of the size of the task and their chance of success given that a number of betterfunded and resourced university have already tried and failed mr style said we have a monumental challenge ahead of u but we are determined to produce a vessel that ha the potential to reach the finish line the biggest threat we face are from external factor which are largely out of our control fishing net adverse weather and larger boat however we aim to stay one step ahead with a carefully plotted route and a robust boat that is fit to face the element if successful thatll do should arrive in antigua approximately six month after launch,"['ashore', 'atlantic', 'summer', 'fishing', 'race', 'transatlantic', 'compete', 'sail', 'boat', 'june']"
Adobe Bolsters Its Commitment to Primary & Secondary Schools with new Creative Cloud offerings and Investment in Professional Development – Education Today,['News'],"May 11, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/adobe-bolsters-its-commitment-to-primary-secondary-schools-with-new-creative-cloud-offerings-and-investment-in-professional-development/,"We, at Adobe, are inspired by the educators we meet around the world who use technology to improve the way students learn and build creative problem-solving skills. Our research showed that this is important to nearly every educator and policymaker, because jobs which require creative problem-solving are less likely to be impacted by automation, and more likely to pay high salaries.
The study also confirmed that many of the barriers to teaching these skills, seen in classrooms, are universal — some of the biggest of which are limited budgets, access to technology, and time to learn new apps. As teachers shift their classrooms to incorporate creative projects that build these skills, over at Adobe, we are also shifting our offerings to give them an affordable, easy, and quick way to succeed.
In January, we announced we were providing access to Spark for Education, a set of storytelling apps with premium features and additional capabilities for primary & secondary schools as well as higher education institutions, free of charge. On April 9th, this offer launched and is now available to primary & secondary schools and local authority and multi-academy trusts.
From 15 May 2018, the full suite of Adobe Creative Cloud apps will be available to primary & secondary schools to provide to their students and teachers. Like Spark for Education, Creative Cloud for primary & secondary schools provides a method for schools to deploy licenses to students of any age in a way that is consistent with data privacy laws. And, it can be setup with single sign-on so that students and teachers can use their existing school ID to access Creative Cloud.
What we’re most excited about is that it allows students to access apps like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, XD, and more, wherever they are and on any device. Sharif Karmally, Sr. Product Marketing Manager, Creative Cloud for Education recalls visiting a high school class where the students were using Photoshop to create posters for a social cause they care about. They were so excited to have a visitor from Adobe that they all applauded. But then a hush fell over the room, and one of them asked their teacher, “how will I finish my project if I can’t work on it during this class?”
Talking to the teacher more, Sharif learned that because access to Creative Cloud was limited to the computer lab, they had to dedicate most of their class time to students working on their project. They could not spend as much time as they wanted teaching students the principles of design and visual communication. With Creative Cloud for primary & secondary schools user licensing, students can continue working on projects at home, and on any device, simply by logging in and opening the apps they need.
These licenses will be available to individual primary & secondary schools starting at £2,495 per year for 500 user licenses (£4.99 per license) to provide to students and teachers. Local Authority and Multi-Academy Trusts are eligible for this offer starting at £12,475 per year for 2,500 licenses which can be spread across the district. For more details, primary & secondary schools and local authority and multi-academy trusts can contact their authorised Adobe re-seller.
In addition to making Creative Cloud more accessible, Adobe is working to provide additional professional development resources to educators. From next year, Adobe will begin conducting hands-on professional development workshops both in schools around the country and online to teach educators new project-based use cases for Adobe Spark and Creative Cloud. This is all in addition to the Adobe Education Exchange, a place where educators can access free courses, workshops, & teaching materials.
We are on an exciting journey, collaborating with educators to empower the next generation to be lifelong creators. With these two new offers, Spark for Education and Creative Cloud for Primary & Secondary schools, we’re equipping teachers with the apps, training, and support they need to make this happen. We can’t wait to see all of the amazing things students create on their journey to becoming the creative problem-solvers of the future.

Education trust expands with new leaders as part of long-term vision – Education Today,"['Academies', 'Appointments', 'MATs', 'News']","May 11, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/education-trust-expands-with-new-leaders-as-part-of-long-term-vision/,"SONY DSC
A successful Multi-Academy Trust in Northumberland has almost doubled its membership and made a raft of senior appointments after welcoming three local schools as partners.
The Three Rivers Learning Trust is now a Mixed Multi-Academy Trust as two Northumberland first schools and a middle school have joined to form an independent community of more than 400 staff and 3,000 students.
Harbottle Church of England First School, Thropton Village First School, and Dr Thomlinson Church of England Middle School, all in the greater Morpeth catchment area, are the newest members of the Trust, which exists to achieve excellence and greater efficiency in all its classrooms. The news follows last year’s Trust expansion as Abbeyfields First School was welcomed as the first step in its aim to grow to around 15 schools in the next five years.
Simon Taylor, CEO of The Three Rivers Learning Trust, said: “We are delighted to welcome these three community schools to the Trust. All of them are important local institutions that strive to give every child the self-confidence to develop a lifelong love of learning they can use in whatever they choose to do in the future.
“Throughout the Trust, each individual is truly valued for their unique contributions, and as a larger Trust, we’ll have a greater expertise to share among each school, to help us deliver the inclusive and innovative educational services that parents and students alike seek out, together with a more effective transition between Key Stages that empowers all our children to thrive.”
The move is already paying dividends as the Trust’s growth enables it to access capital funding of around £500K per annum that will help improve all of the school buildings it looks after. Liam Murtagh, Executive Head of Dr Thomlinson Middle School and Thropton First School, added: “We feel that this exciting development for both our schools will deliver significant benefits to the future learning and wellbeing of our children.”
The Trust expansion has also led to a review and restructure of leadership roles, including the introduction of a CEO, and the appointments of new Headteachers at Chanty and Newminster Middle Schools, and at The King Edward VI School, all in Morpeth.
Following a robust recruitment process, Simon Taylor, who was previously Executive Headteacher across The King Edward VI School, and Chantry and Newminster Middle Schools, will now lead all seven establishments as CEO, while from September 2018, Clare Savage, previously Deputy Head at The King Edward VI School will take up the Headteacher position. Meanwhile, Liz Kinninment will become Headteacher at Newminster Middle School, having previously been Head of School, and Bryan Stewart will lead Chantry Middle School as Headteacher, moving from his previous position as Deputy Head of The King Edward VI School.
Simon Taylor said: “We are thrilled to confirm these appointments, which not only strengthen our leadership and governance, but also provide continuity across the Trust for the mutual benefit of staff, students and parents.”
All seven of The Three Rivers Learning Trust’s schools are publicly funded, independent schools, working together as one cohesive unit in response to local educational needs. With greater autonomy and collaboration across an age range from three to 18, The Three Rivers, which was previously a Multi-Academy Trust made up of The King Edward VI School, along with Chantry and Newminster Middle Schools, is able to provide better links throughout the school experience to improve career opportunities for staff and students alike.
But from September 2018, Chantry Middle School, which is popular and currently oversubscribed, is to take on an extra 30 pupils as part of an agreement with Northumberland County Council to ensure every pupil in Chantry’s catchment area is guaranteed a place at their local school. Simon continued:
“Morpeth is a growing community, with demand in particular on Chantry and Newminster Middle Schools growing alongside it. We’ve worked with the local authority to meet this growing demand, by expanding Year 5 at Chantry Middle School by 30 places from the beginning of the next academic year, and if demand remains high, Newminster will also take on an extra 30 pupils in Year 5 from September 2019.”
This arrangement could continue year on year to support the increasing school age population as the Trust works to achieve greater efficiency and excellence across all its classrooms. Simon added:
“We are now working with Northumberland County Council to ensure The King Edward VI School has the necessary facilities to support the increased demand as these larger middle school year groups progress through their school careers.”

As National Director for Strategy and Quality Improvement for Ormiston Academies Trust (OAT) – which has sponsored academies since 2009, and currently has 36 academies (30 secondary, five primary, and one all-through special school) – Amelia will be responsible for OAT’s overall policy and planning work, its fundraising strategy and its corporate governance.
Amelia Walker said: “I am thrilled and honoured to be joining Ormiston Academies Trust. Working for one of the leading and largest academy trusts in the country, and liaising directly with heads and teachers every day, there is huge scope to shape the futures of tens of thousands of children and young people, which is enormously exciting.
“OAT has always been focused on supporting children and young people from all backgrounds to achieve their very best but, with its academies so often in disadvantaged areas, it has a moral purpose that chimes with my own. Many of the children and young people joining OAT’s academies are those most in need of a first-class education, and I can’t wait to get started.
“It will be a real wrench to leave Ofsted. It is a great team, and I am very proud of what we have achieved in the time I have been there, and for the support I have received throughout.”
Nick Hudson, the Chief Executive Officer of OAT, said: “I am delighted that Amelia will be joining the OAT family. Amelia’s is a key role, helping to shape the direction of the organisation and our academies, and supporting the 27,000 students we serve every day.
“Her background, track record, insight and energy made her the stand-out candidate in what was a very strong field, and we look forward to her delivering for OAT, our academies and the students.”",ormiston academy trust one of the leading education provider in the country today announced that amelia walker will be it new national director for strategy and quality improvement amelia join the trust from ofsted where she ha been deputy director for research and evaluation since september her work there includes leading the organisation strategic planning process to set the forward plan for research and evaluation and steering it national programme of curriculum research amelia ha been with ofsted since previously holding role there a principal officer for knowledge management and head of strategic policy and planning before ofsted amelia worked at the local government information unit havering council and the department for work and pension she is also a member of the board of trustee for the spitalfields crypt trust an east london charity supporting people living with the consequence of alcohol and drug addiction a national director for strategy and quality improvement for ormiston academy trust oat which ha sponsored academy since and currently ha academy secondary five primary and one allthrough special school amelia will be responsible for oat overall policy and planning work it fundraising strategy and it corporate governance amelia walker said i am thrilled and honoured to be joining ormiston academy trust working for one of the leading and largest academy trust in the country and liaising directly with head and teacher every day there is huge scope to shape the future of ten of thousand of child and young people which is enormously exciting oat ha always been focused on supporting child and young people from all background to achieve their very best but with it academy so often in disadvantaged area it ha a moral purpose that chime with my own many of the child and young people joining oat academy are those most in need of a firstclass education and i cant wait to get started it will be a real wrench to leave ofsted it is a great team and i am very proud of what we have achieved in the time i have been there and for the support i have received throughout nick hudson the chief executive officer of oat said i am delighted that amelia will be joining the oat family amelia is a key role helping to shape the direction of the organisation and our academy and supporting the student we serve every day her background track record insight and energy made her the standout candidate in what wa a very strong field and we look forward to her delivering for oat our academy and the student,"['student', 'amelia', 'charity', 'curriculum', 'fundraising', 'education', 'ofsted', 'firstclass', 'teacher', 'principal']"
DfE workforce data confirms that school leadership recruitment is a leaky pipeline – Education Today,"['Funding', 'Leadership', 'News', 'Policy', 'Recruitment']","May 8, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/dfe-workforce-data-confirms-that-school-leadership-recruitment-is-a-leaky-pipeline/,"Commenting on the recent release of government data about school leadership roles, NAHT’s Head of Policy Valentine Mulholland said: “These statistics confirm what our members have been reporting for some time – that school leaders are walking away from the profession or taking a demotion in large numbers. Nearly a third of school leaders appointed as new secondary heads in 2013 had left by 2016, and for primary heads it was nearly 1 in 5, and the numbers are growing.”
In NAHT’s Leaky Pipeline survey this year, respondents reported a rise in the failure to recruit to deputy and assistant head roles, with 78% of deputy roles being difficult or failed to recruit and 70% of assistant head roles posing a similar problem.
Ms Mulholland continued: “More and more is being expected of schools and their leaders and yet funding and support for schools is being cut. This creates more and more pressure. At the same time, the methods used to hold schools to account have become increasingly punitive. One bad year of test or exam results for your school can lead to losing your job.
“When the system is causing this many leaders to walk away, something needs to change. That’s why the announcement by the Secretary of State that the government will look again at how it holds schools to account is an important and welcome move.”",commenting on the recent release of government data about school leadership role nahts head of policy valentine mulholland said these statistic confirm what our member have been reporting for some time that school leader are walking away from the profession or taking a demotion in large number nearly a third of school leader appointed a new secondary head in had left by and for primary head it wa nearly in and the number are growing in nahts leaky pipeline survey this year respondent reported a rise in the failure to recruit to deputy and assistant head role with of deputy role being difficult or failed to recruit and of assistant head role posing a similar problem m mulholland continued more and more is being expected of school and their leader and yet funding and support for school is being cut this creates more and more pressure at the same time the method used to hold school to account have become increasingly punitive one bad year of test or exam result for your school can lead to losing your job when the system is causing this many leader to walk away something need to change thats why the announcement by the secretary of state that the government will look again at how it hold school to account is an important and welcome move,"['school', 'deputy', 'government', 'recruit', 'leaky', 'losing', 'recent', 'valentine', 'exam', 'demotion']"

Coventry school celebrates second consecutive Outstanding Ofsted – Education Today,"['News', 'OFSTED', 'Primary schools', 'State schools']","May 3, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/coventry-school-celebrates-second-consecutive-outstanding-ofsted/,"Children and staff at a Coventry school are celebrating after being hailed Outstanding for a second consecutive time.
Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School, in Brays Lane, has been given the top grading from Ofsted inspectors.
The rating was celebrated with a non-uniform day where everyone was treated to ice creams and a bouncy castle.
The school, which is part of the Romero Catholic Academy, was judged to be Outstanding in all areas including outcomes for pupils; teaching, learning and assessment; personal development, behaviour and welfare as well as leadership and management.
The quality of the children’s reading and writing is particularly praised in the newly-released report, which says: “Pupils’ progress and the quality of their writing are Outstanding. Over the last five years, pupils’ attainment at the end of Key Stage 2 in writing has been above, or well above, the levels seen nationally.”
The report refers to Principal Paul Madia as ‘inspirational’ and says that there are high-quality processes in place to continually improve teaching and excellent training for new leaders.
Parents are described as having ‘unwavering’ praise for the staff and leadership, commenting to inspectors that ‘the school is superb’ and ‘the teaching is strong’.
The pupils themselves are also described as a credit to the school, with the report stating that they are ‘polite, well-mannered and mature’ and that their ‘work ethic in lessons is terrific’.
Paul Madia said: “We are extremely proud to be rated as Outstanding for the second consecutive time.
“We have been through a number of Ofsted framework changes and each time the bar has been raised making it even harder to achieve outstanding, which makes the outcome of our latest inspection even more rewarding.
“The report praises everyone from across the school, including our incredible staff and senior leadership team, our Local Academy Committee and of course our excellent children.
“We are a united team working towards the same goal, and at the end of the day it’s all about the children so we are delighted to provide them with a school they can be proud of.
“Myself and Executive Principal Helen Quinn would like to thank everyone for their support in helping us achieve this Outstanding success.
“One of the school’s main strap lines is where memories are made – so of course we celebrated in style by holding a non-uniform day where we had a bouncy castle and a visit from an ice cream van.

"Winchester Science Centre launches the ultimate STEM school trip, with a pricing structure designed to build science capital for all – Education Today","['News', 'Science', 'Space!', 'STEM']","May 2, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/winchester-science-centre-launches-the-ultimate-stem-school-trip-with-a-pricing-structure-designed-to-build-science-capital-for-all/,"School children are invited to explore science and take a guided mission through space, as part of Winchester Science Centre and Planetarium’s new ultimate STEM experience for school visits. The new all-inclusive experience is designed to spark curiosity and ignite passion and enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM).
The new programme includes a revised pricing structure designed to make the Science Centre’s school visits affordable for all. State-funded schools benefit from a 15% discount and those with a higher than average number of children receiving free school meals are eligible for 60% off the standard rate. Furthermore, the Science Centre has identified 60 neighbouring schools that will also get 60% off.
The new school trips include a choice of six Key Stage 1-3 themed workshops exploring Sound, Space, Life, Matter, Robots, and Rockets; a live planetarium show; an interactive space challenge – a guided mission through Explorer:Space, a new zone opening this Summer; and time for students to explore the hands-on activities in exhibition hall.
The educational charity is now taking bookings for the next academic year and is calling on teachers and parents to make the Science Centre their first choice for school trips.
“Winchester Science Centre has all the right ingredients for the perfect school visit,” said Emily Thorpe-Smith, Head of STEM Strategy at Winchester Science Centre. “We welcome over 40,000 students on school trips every year and have an incredible team of experienced science communicators, who are great at connecting with children. The new programme for school visits will guarantee students get the very most out of their visit.
“We don’t want cost to be a barrier for teachers planning their school trips. The new pricing structure means state-funded schools benefit from a 15% discount and those with a higher than average number of children receiving free school meals will be eligible for 60% off the standard rate. In addition, through our long-term community engagement programme, we have identified 60 priority schools located in Aldershot, Andover, Basingstoke, Bordon, Gosport and Southampton that will also get 60% off their school visit, bringing the cost to only £3.80 per child.
“We have a brilliant team of Curiosity Officers and Inspirers running our live shows and workshops – the new offer ensures this activity is at the heart of every school visit and not an added extra limited solely to the schools that can afford it. This is in line with our charity’s mission of building science capital for all,” added Emily.
Winchester Science Centre’s profile is going from strength-to-strength thanks to the leadership of Ben Ward, who became CEO in November 2016. The Science Centre recently welcomed its millionth visitor into the highly-popular Planetarium attraction, which is in fact the largest standalone planetarium in the UK. Over the past year, thanks to the new weekend and holiday offer, more than 180,000 people have visited – the highest ever recorded.
Ben Ward, CEO of Winchester Science Centre and Planetarium said: “Over the past 18 months, the charity has invested in its staff and in developing its events programme. We’ve launched the Invention Studio, introduced themed weekends, free holiday activities, a holiday club, a new Christmas experience and an evening events programme. And it’s making a real difference; we’ve seen many more people enjoying the Centre, including plenty of first-time visitors, which is great. We are really excited to continue inspiring and empowering children in STEM.”
The new schools offer is available from September 2018, for the next academic year. Schools can still book the current programme this summer term.

IB Middle Years Programme eAssessment wins international award – Education Today,"['Assessment', 'Digital learning', 'Exams', 'News']","April 20, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/ib-middle-years-programme-eassessment-wins-international-award/,"The International Baccalaureate (IB) Middle Years Programme (MYP) eAssessment has been awarded Best Use of Summative Assessment and was highly commended for Best Transformational Project at this year’s eAssessment Awards, which highlights the very best practice, research and innovation within eAssessment.
Up against stiff international competition in the category, including the French Ministry of Education, judges commented that the MYP eAssessment “was impressive in how the examinations are designed to assess students’ higher thinking skills which previously had been harder to do using paper testing” and that it “clearly demonstrates that it is possible to successfully deliver online summative assessment in schools anywhere in the world”.
Dr Sue Wilkinson, IB’s Head of eAssessment, said: “We are so proud that the MYP eAssessment has been recognised for its innovative examination techniques which make learning and assessment more meaningful. The eAssessment is a key stage in the IB journey to developing students who are independent and critical thinkers with the skills to create a better world”.
Beyond rote memorisation 
The MYP eAssessment, which is regulated by Ofqual in the UK, is for MYP Year 5 students and goes beyond rote memorisation—75% focuses on inquiry, communication and critical thinking skills.
Wilkinson said: “Students are challenged to connect what they have learned with what they might learn next, collect data, analyse results and apply big ideas to solving real-world problems. As such, a single examination provides an effective assessment of the broad range of knowledge, skills and concepts needed to thrive and succeed in the 21st century”.
Different types of tasks are used within the on-screen examinations to test specific skills meaning that student’s achievement against all subject objectives is thoroughly tested. For example, a short essay assesses writing capabilities, creating an infographic to assess communication skills.
Commenting on the relevance of the eAssessment for MYP students, Angela Brassington, an MYP coordinator at Munich International School said: “Students prefer the on-screen examinations because this reflects how they learn on a daily basis. The on-screen examinations are media rich and dynamic, so questions can be designed that require much more creative responses or responses that require students to manipulate data and present new understandings, in a way that is not possible on paper”.",the international baccalaureate ib middle year programme myp eassessment ha been awarded best use of summative assessment and wa highly commended for best transformational project at this year eassessment award which highlight the very best practice research and innovation within eassessment up against stiff international competition in the category including the french ministry of education judge commented that the myp eassessment wa impressive in how the examination are designed to ass student higher thinking skill which previously had been harder to do using paper testing and that it clearly demonstrates that it is possible to successfully deliver online summative assessment in school anywhere in the world dr sue wilkinson ibs head of eassessment said we are so proud that the myp eassessment ha been recognised for it innovative examination technique which make learning and assessment more meaningful the eassessment is a key stage in the ib journey to developing student who are independent and critical thinker with the skill to create a better world beyond rote memorisation the myp eassessment which is regulated by ofqual in the uk is for myp year student and go beyond rote memorisation— focus on inquiry communication and critical thinking skill wilkinson said student are challenged to connect what they have learned with what they might learn next collect data analyse result and apply big idea to solving realworld problem a such a single examination provides an effective assessment of the broad range of knowledge skill and concept needed to thrive and succeed in the st century different type of task are used within the onscreen examination to test specific skill meaning that student achievement against all subject objective is thoroughly tested for example a short essay ass writing capability creating an infographic to ass communication skill commenting on the relevance of the eassessment for myp student angela brassington an myp coordinator at munich international school said student prefer the onscreen examination because this reflects how they learn on a daily basis the onscreen examination are medium rich and dynamic so question can be designed that require much more creative response or response that require student to manipulate data and present new understanding in a way that is not possible on paper,"['student', 'succeed', 'munich', 'innovative', 'education', 'achievement', 'competition', 'proud', 'innovation', 'rich']"
UK’s brightest innovators from schools across the country compete in national coding challenge – Education Today,"['Competition', 'Computing', 'Digital skills', 'News', 'Reward & Recognition']","April 18, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/uks-brightest-innovators-from-schools-across-the-country-compete-in-national-coding-challenge/,"The UK’s brightest innovators from schools across the country competed in the final of PA Consulting Group’s sixth annual Raspberry Pi coding competition on Tuesday 17 April 2018.
PA’s annual competition aims to inspire the innovators of the future. This year, it challenges school children and college students to use the credit-card-sized, highly capable Raspberry Pi computer to produce innovations to help save the planet.
The winners of the 2018 competition were as follows:
Primary school: academic years 4 – 6  Ysgol Deganwy, Conwy
The winning entry in the primary school category was Ysgol Deganwy, who created ‘Recycle Michael’. This is an interactive rubbish bin that uses a barcode scanner to scan barcodes on waste packaging and then display useful information on a screen above the bin compartments. The bin is designed to enable users to identify which recycling compartment to put their waste into and also develop their understanding of the importance of recycling through interesting and educational facts displayed when a product is scanned.
Why the team won: The clarity of the team’s idea impressed the judges. Recycling is a major issue and the team solved it in a really simple way. The judges can see the potential of the idea and could imagine Recycle Michael being scaled up to appear in offices and homes across the country.
Finalists: Croydon High School; St Mary’s Church of England Primary School
Secondary school: academic years 7 – 11  Kenilworth School
This team created a solution to energy waste; a system of infrared beams which work together to identify when no-one is nearby, and switch off the unnecessary streetlights in the area. Multiple infrared pointers and receivers can be controlled by a single Raspberry Pi, saving costs and energy consumption. An infrared mirror on the opposite side of the road to the transmitter is used to reflect the beam back to the receiver, and when the beam is broken, all the streetlights nearby are turned on.
Why the team won: The team had a clear and inspirational goal and the judges loved the way they used different technology to solve their problem. The team also had an excellent mix of skills.
Finalists: Tanbridge House School, Usk Code Club
Secondary school/college: academic years 12 – 13  The College of Richard Collyer 
The winning team created a simple, portable and lightweight charger that makes use of two renewable energies (wind and solar power) to charge four rechargeable AA batteries. It does this without harming the environment. The team created a small-scale model that has the potential to power much more than batteries if it was to be upscaled and produced industrially.
Why the team won: The judges were impressed by the imagination of the team and how their innovation used mostly recycled materials. The team were also able to present the technical details of their idea to the judges with clarity.
Finalists: Felpham Community College, King Edward VI Grammar School
Anita Chandraker, who leads PA’s innovation services team, says: “The quality of ideas the teams have come up with for the 2018 Raspberry Pi challenge is astounding. The finalists have developed genuine innovations, some of which we think could be applied in the real world to help improve sustainability.
“As a firm, we are passionate about technology and our aim for the competition is to highlight the importance of technology and coding skills, and their role in supporting our future economy. It’s such an inspiring competition and we are delighted to see young children getting involved in coding with such passion and enthusiasm.”",the uk brightest innovator from school across the country competed in the final of pa consulting group sixth annual raspberry pi coding competition on tuesday april pa annual competition aim to inspire the innovator of the future this year it challenge school child and college student to use the creditcardsized highly capable raspberry pi computer to produce innovation to help save the planet the winner of the competition were a follows primary school academic year ysgol deganwy conwy the winning entry in the primary school category wa ysgol deganwy who created recycle michael this is an interactive rubbish bin that us a barcode scanner to scan barcodes on waste packaging and then display useful information on a screen above the bin compartment the bin is designed to enable user to identify which recycling compartment to put their waste into and also develop their understanding of the importance of recycling through interesting and educational fact displayed when a product is scanned why the team won the clarity of the team idea impressed the judge recycling is a major issue and the team solved it in a really simple way the judge can see the potential of the idea and could imagine recycle michael being scaled up to appear in office and home across the country finalist croydon high school st mary church of england primary school secondary school academic year kenilworth school this team created a solution to energy waste a system of infrared beam which work together to identify when noone is nearby and switch off the unnecessary streetlight in the area multiple infrared pointer and receiver can be controlled by a single raspberry pi saving cost and energy consumption an infrared mirror on the opposite side of the road to the transmitter is used to reflect the beam back to the receiver and when the beam is broken all the streetlight nearby are turned on why the team won the team had a clear and inspirational goal and the judge loved the way they used different technology to solve their problem the team also had an excellent mix of skill finalist tanbridge house school usk code club secondary schoolcollege academic year the college of richard collyer the winning team created a simple portable and lightweight charger that make use of two renewable energy wind and solar power to charge four rechargeable aa battery it doe this without harming the environment the team created a smallscale model that ha the potential to power much more than battery if it wa to be upscaled and produced industrially why the team won the judge were impressed by the imagination of the team and how their innovation used mostly recycled material the team were also able to present the technical detail of their idea to the judge with clarity finalist felpham community college king edward vi grammar school anita chandraker who lead pa innovation service team say the quality of idea the team have come up with for the raspberry pi challenge is astounding the finalist have developed genuine innovation some of which we think could be applied in the real world to help improve sustainability a a firm we are passionate about technology and our aim for the competition is to highlight the importance of technology and coding skill and their role in supporting our future economy it such an inspiring competition and we are delighted to see young child getting involved in coding with such passion and enthusiasm,"['competed', 'winning', 'innovation', 'april', 'competition', 'annual', 'schoolcollege', 'raspberry', 'tuesday', 'finalist']"
Trio of new schools for children with special educational needs nears completion – Education Today,"['Infrastructure', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Secondary schools', 'SEND']","April 17, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/trio-of-new-schools-for-children-with-special-educational-needs-nears-completion/,"The second of three purpose-built schools which will transform education for pupils with social, emotional and mental health needs opened this week in Leeds.
Springwell Leeds South at Middleton will serve 100 youngsters aged 11-16. In January, a sister site Springwell Leeds East opened at Seacroft and in September, a further site serving the north of the city will open at Tinshill.
The schools will operate, together with an already opened school at Oakwood, as Springwell Leeds Academy which manages care and education for children with Social, Emotional and Mental Health (SEMH) needs between the ages of five and 16.
Leeds City Council has invested £45 million as part of an ambitious scheme with Wellspring Academy Trust to transform specialist education across the city. Wellspring Academy Trust, which operates schools across the north of England, has a track record of outstanding academies and a strong reputation for excellence in specialist education.
When the final site in north Leeds opens in September, the four schools will cater for 340 children. More than 60 staff have been recruited and around 100 jobs created.
The new state-of-the-art facilities will include specialist teaching areas, sensory rooms, 3G sports pitches, a library, fitness centre as well as multi-use games areas and an agricultural outdoor space complete with chickens.
Wellspring Academy Trust Chief Executive Mark Wilson (pictured) said: “These new schools provide a welcoming, caring, safe, and warm environment where children can be supported and empowered to succeed.
“The dedicated staff at Springwell Leeds Academy have developed a curriculum that provides opportunities for academic progression as well as vocational learning, whilst being engaging, creative, and innovative. These are very exciting times for specialist education in Leeds.”
Executive Principal of Springwell Leeds Academy, Scott Jacques, said: “The investment made in these buildings will help us to deliver our vision. Here at Springwell Leeds Academy we have ‘Unconditional Positive Regard’ for our students and this is at the centre of what we do. It’s all about being authentic, showing that you really do believe in the children. We believe in the children and they believe in us.”
Steve Walker, director of children and families at Leeds City Council, said: “Our ambition is for Leeds to be the best city to live and grow up in for all its children and young people, and the council has invested £45 million to ensure that children with social, emotional and mental health needs have access to world class learning provision.
“The opening of Springwell Leeds South is a key milestone in ensuring that children and young people with additional needs have the support they require to reach their potential.”
The building work for the Wellspring and city council partnership is being delivered by Interserve, the international support services and construction group.
Wellspring’s unique approach was one of the reasons the Trust was referenced by the Department for Education as being a “model of inclusiveness” in a recent Parliamentary Select Committee session.

School students to become Earth Observation researchers through UK Space Agency funded project – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'Environmental Focus', 'News', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space!', 'Teaching resources']","April 16, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/school-students-to-become-earth-observation-researchers-through-uk-space-agency-funded-project/,"Currently in its pilot phase and set to roll out to other schools in Spring 2018, the Institute for Research in Schools (IRIS) has launched MELT, a project that offers students the chance to contribute to the understanding of our planet’s environmental changes.
The UK Space Agency has provided a grant to support the project, which will look at human behaviour through analysis of the carbon footprint of homes and schools alongside the monitoring of changes in polar ice using Earth Observation data.
For the Earth Observation element of the project, students will monitor the changes in the polar regions, captured by satellites. Icebergs are produced in a natural process known as “calving”, and recently, some dramatic changes have been captured, which may suggest the environmental conditions within the region have changed. Collaborating with Dr Anna Hogg from the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) at the University of Leeds, students will be analysing satellite imaging and sharing findings with other scientists.
Dr Hogg added: “There are really exciting opportunities for students to work with Earth Observation scientists on major changes at the poles. We used Sentinel-1 satellite data to watch a giant iceberg four times the size of London break free from Antarctica’s Larsen-C ice shelf in 2017, and now students can use the same data to measure if new icebergs calve off some of the fastest flowing glaciers in the world!”
MELT also challenges schools to calculate their carbon footprint by using the carbon calculator. As part of the project, students develop ideas for reducing their carbon output, which they will do by collaborating with other schools and groups across the UK and by sharing their data.
Darren Harman, STEM Learning Leader at Sir Robert Woodard Academy, commented: “MELT has presented a group of our Year 9 students at the Sir Robert Woodard Academy with an amazing opportunity to be part of novel science research, that will undoubtedly enrich their experience of learning science in a way that they wouldn’t otherwise have access to until university and beyond.
“Not only are they excited at what they might discover looking at data no other human has yet cast their eyes upon, but also the prospect of inspiring students at local primary schools to share in their experience of running live science research in schools.”
Professor Becky Parker, director of IRIS said: ‘We’re really looking forward to seeing the results from the MELT project, it’s a great opportunity for schools to engage their students in work to impact the environment and use the latest satellite data.  It’s fantastic to receive the backing from the UK Space Agency and our schools can’t wait to get started.’

"Media Alert: Adobe Launches Spark with Premium Features for Every Student, Free of Charge – Education Today",['News'],"April 13, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/media-alert-adobe-launches-spark-with-premium-features-for-every-student-free-of-charge/,"Adobe Spark empowers creativity and enhances digital literacy for teacher and students in classrooms and at home
Adobe announced today that Spark for Education with premium features and additional functionality is now available to primary, secondary, and higher education students free of charge. This follows an announcement during BETT 2018 and successful trials with primary and secondary institutes in various school districts across North America. Normally priced at £101.15 per year, Adobe Spark for Education is a fun and frictionless storytelling Creative Cloud application that runs in any web or mobile browser, enabling students to quickly and easily express themselves via graphics, web stories and video to complete their school assignments and showcase digital creativity.
Adobe’s research has shown that jobs of the future will demand both creativity and creative problem solving skills – two different capabilities that 97% of educators recognise as being essential for students to learn in school. However, the research also shows that the biggest barriers educators currently face to teach these skills are the lack of access to necessary tools and technologies and the time required to teach students how to use creative tools. Adobe Spark for Education was built to solve both of these issues. In addition to making the application free to schools, Adobe has also introduced named user licensing, enabling students to log into their account and work on creative projects from any location on any device, even from their homes. These licenses can be deployed by primary and secondary schools in a way that is consistent with data privacy laws including COPPA—the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
“I have seen first-hand the importance of fun, easy-to-use creativity tools in the classroom, and believe that Adobe Spark will enhance how educators teach digital and creative-problem solving skills to open up a range of new possibilities for students who want to express themselves,” said Mala Sharma, VP and GM of Creative Cloud product marketing & engagement at Adobe. “Access to tools and resources is a key factor in education, and by providing Spark with premium features to K-12 (primary and secondary) schools and colleges for free and by offering single sign-on, Adobe is empowering educators to teach the critical skills their students need both in the classroom and when they enter the workforce.” 
Details on how educators can get Spark for Education with premium features for free for their school and universities, along with Spark training and professional development complete with a guide to using Spark in the classroom, can be found on the Spark for Education website. Additionally, Adobe offers a free platform, the Education Exchange, where educators can access free courses taught by their peers and share teaching materials and curriculum.

The Crypt School take home the trophy in UK e-sports tournament for schools – Education Today,"['Careers', 'Competition', 'Digital skills', 'Educational event', 'News']","April 13, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-crypt-school-take-home-the-trophy-in-uk-e-sports-tournament-for-schools/,"Four schools from across the UK gathered in Gfinity’s London arena yesterday to battle it out for the coveted e-sports trophy, designed by a father-daughter duo representing Creative Assembly. After fierce competition, the Crypt School came out on top and went home the winners at this unique competitive-gaming-meets-careers event.
With the backing of gaming industry giants such as David Yarnton, director of Gfinity & chair of Ukie E-sports Group, to cheer them on, students from the Crypt School didn’t just attend the event to play. Students also found out how e-sports can support skills vital to their computing lessons, and how these skills are vital to a wide range of jobs available in the gaming industry. This includes question and answer sessions and one-to-one careers advice with a number of e-sports professionals.
As such, the bridge between education and business was created as part of the London Games Festival, a programme that has been designed to support, grow and promote the video games and interactive entertainment sectors.
The event is run by Digital Schoolhouse, powered by PlayStation, a programme delivered by games industry trade body, Ukie, as a way of creating a bridge between the education and technology sector. There is no other e-sports tournament in the UK for schools, so Digital Schoolhouse included additional stages to the competition this year after the pilot year, last year, resulted in extra demand.
Susan Green, teacher and STEM development manager at the Crypt School said: “The opportunity presented by Digital Schoolhouse has empowered my students to realise their skills and develop new ones. Overall it is fun and inspiring, and more importantly, it helps them see pathways for their own future.”
Students put their communication, creative thinking, team work and strategic thinking skills to the test as they used the popular game by Activision Blizzard, Overwatch, to compete for the first prize, which, as well as the trophy included, medals for individual team members, a PlayStation 4, a framed signed Overwatch poster and a limited edition statue of the character Soldier 76.  There was also a medal awarded to second place with a statue of Overwatch character, Soldier 76, and a trophy awarded for ‘Best Shoutcaster 2018’ to Daniel Parker from New College, Swindon.
The winning team, Cryptonite, commented on their victory, saying: “It’s been amazing that Digital Schoolhouse have given a platform for children like us around the country to come together and have this experience.”
Shahneila Saeed, programme director for Digital Schoolhouse, said: “After such a successful event last year, there were high expectations to meet again with this year’s Digital Schoolhouse Esports Tournament. The feedback from everyone has been great, particularly about the additional stage we have added this year. By including a regional qualifiers round, we were able to include more schools with the competition this year and reach even more students to engage them with computing.
“We have also been overwhelmed with the enthusiasm and commitment shown not only by the schools and students themselves, but by our sponsors and industry professionals who have gone above and beyond to support us in providing participants with a fun and engaging experience, as well as practical career advice.”

"Jobcentre advisors delivered coaching sessions to over 1,000 schools – Education Today","['Careers', 'KS3', 'KS4', 'KS5', 'News', 'Secondary schools']","April 12, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/jobcentre-advisors-delivered-coaching-sessions-to-over-1000-schools/,"A partnership between Jobcentre Plus and local schools has resulted in around 12,000 sessions for pupils, parents and teachers, helping to prepare pupils for the world of work.
The Jobcentre Plus Support for Schools programme targets young people ages 12-18 who are at particular risk of being out of education, employment or training (NEET) or who face disadvantages when looking for work. It began in November 2016 as a pilot across 10 districts, and has since rolled out nationally across England with over 1,400 schools participating following positive feedback from teachers and pupils.
Despite more than 90% of 15-19 year olds now being in employment, education or training, there is still work to be done to ensure that all young people get access to the right skills to succeed in the labour market.
The Minister for Employment, Alok Sharma, said: “The Jobcentre Plus Support for Schools programme is a strong example of how local jobcentres and schools are coming together to help young people realise their true potential.
“I’ve been encouraged by my discussions with students about how much of a positive difference this has made to their confidence and career prospects. We are committed to ensuring everyone has the opportunity to get into work and, quite importantly, a role they enjoy.”
Jobcentre staff were seen as a credible addition to teachers when providing employment advice and tips on writing CVs, conducting mock interviews and feedback sessions as well as holding industry taster days. They were also able to offer advice on apprenticeships, traineeships and the job market in the local area.
Jobcentre Support for Schools Advisor Rose Marie, who helped to run the programme, said: “The programme is a great opportunity to raise the aspirations of the young people by exploring opportunities available and examining career options that they might not have otherwise looked into.
“I was able to help them to focus their attention and efforts on building and achieving their goals, where possible exceeding them, and because we worked directly with the school, the programme complimented what was already being provided, adding real value.”

One of the headteachers involved with the programme said: “I was really surprised at how they were able to engage with our [PRU] students… the students genuinely seemed to engage, which we’ve not had with other providers.”

"120,000 children set to benefit from £1.6 million investment in Heritage Schools programme – Education Today","['Community engagement', 'History', 'News', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","April 11, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/120000-children-set-to-benefit-from-1-6-million-investment-in-heritage-schools-programme/,"The Department for Education yesterday (Tuesday 10 April 2018) announced £1.6 million for Historic England’s award-winning Heritage Schools programme, allowing the scheme to continue for the next two years.
Thanks to Heritage Schools, half a million children have already taken part in a range of stimulating projects including creating local heritage films, community exhibitions and some have even campaigned to have their local war memorial included on the National Heritage List for England.
The programme supports teachers in learning about the heritage of the area they teach in, so they can embed it into the curriculum, and make local links with the national story of England.
Since the programme started in 2012, Historic England has provided direct support to more than 600 schools, and training to 3000 teachers and trainee teachers, reaching more than 500,000 schoolchildren across the country.
Historic England has worked with a wide range of local heritage services including museums, galleries, libraries and archives to develop local heritage resources that teachers can use in the classroom. School projects are specific to the local area and children have uncovered some fascinating stories: from discovering their school was used as a military hospital during the First World War; to finding out how local women battled for the vote a hundred years ago; to how the mining, fishing or cotton industry shaped their town.
Deborah Lamb OBE, Deputy Chief Executive at Historic England said: “We are delighted that the Department for Education has extended the funding for our Heritage Schools programme to 2020, so even more children can learn about and enjoy the heritage of where they live. Children are inspired by and feel connected to the heritage on their doorstep, and develop a sense of place by exploring the buildings and sites that make where they live special.”
Schools are provided with free resources, teaching packs, learning guides and thousands of archive images that are free to download from the Historic England website.
Historic England has extensive online resources for teachers, including a pre-historic timeline, teaching notes, presentations and activities exploring life in the Bronze Age. The most popular downloads are Saxon England, First World War and ‘What makes our place special?’",the department for education yesterday tuesday april announced million for historic england awardwinning heritage school programme allowing the scheme to continue for the next two year thanks to heritage school half a million child have already taken part in a range of stimulating project including creating local heritage film community exhibition and some have even campaigned to have their local war memorial included on the national heritage list for england the programme support teacher in learning about the heritage of the area they teach in so they can embed it into the curriculum and make local link with the national story of england since the programme started in historic england ha provided direct support to more than school and training to teacher and trainee teacher reaching more than schoolchildren across the country historic england ha worked with a wide range of local heritage service including museum gallery library and archive to develop local heritage resource that teacher can use in the classroom school project are specific to the local area and child have uncovered some fascinating story from discovering their school wa used a a military hospital during the first world war to finding out how local woman battled for the vote a hundred year ago to how the mining fishing or cotton industry shaped their town deborah lamb obe deputy chief executive at historic england said we are delighted that the department for education ha extended the funding for our heritage school programme to so even more child can learn about and enjoy the heritage of where they live child are inspired by and feel connected to the heritage on their doorstep and develop a sense of place by exploring the building and site that make where they live special school are provided with free resource teaching pack learning guide and thousand of archive image that are free to download from the historic england website historic england ha extensive online resource for teacher including a prehistoric timeline teaching note presentation and activity exploring life in the bronze age the most popular downloads are saxon england first world war and what make our place special,"['library', 'fishing', 'online', 'teacher', 'saxon', 'yesterday', 'awardwinning', 'april', 'schoolchildren', 'tuesday']"
Private tuition agency teams up with charity to help disadvantaged learners to university – Education Today,"['Attainment', 'Charity', 'News', 'Social issues']","April 10, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/private-tuition-agency-teams-up-with-charity-to-help-disadvantaged-learners-to-university/,"It was last week reported that the university diversity drive is failing Britain’s ‘poorest’ students. Statistics released by UCAS, the admissions body, showed that there were 12,760 university applications from the UK’s richest postcode areas for the September 2018 intake, compared to a meagre 7,210 applications from students living in the poorest areas.
Despite this shocking disparity, one of London’s leading private tuition agencies (which can charge up to £200 per hour for tuition) has taken action to combat this imbalance in the education sector. Bright Young Things, whose clients include royalty, has partnered with The Access Project, a charity supporting bright young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to get to top universities. The aim of the partnership is to ‘provide quality education to all,’ said a spokesperson for the agency.
According to The Sutton Trust, 79% of privately educated children in London received private tuition in 2016. Despite the positives of children improving their confidence and attainment, this figure sadly demonstrates an increase in inequality: the 6.5% of children in the UK who are privately educated are also by far the most likely to be further supported by private education.
Only 21% of the 93.5% of students in the UK not at private school receive tuition, and within these students are the staggeringly large 15% of secondary school pupils in the UK who are eligible for Free School Meals. Unfortunately, again according to The Sutton Trust’s research, these students only currently make up 2% of the intake at the UK’s most selective universities.
Charities such as The Access Project have been fighting to challenge these odds by working with motivated students from less privileged backgrounds over five years to offer them a stronger chance of meeting their potential. Bright Young Things has created a collaboration with them, in order to also reach out to these students: Booster Days. Booster Days are designed to bring Access Project students from around London together for a day’s close focus on one subject. The first session on April 6th focused on Chemistry, a subject that many students struggle with and for which there is a shortage of tutors. Led by Bright Young Things tutor James Weber and developed by Bright Young Things’ Carys Wright, the day focused on topics that were pre-selected by the students and approached in a range of ways.
‘The students were a joy to have in BYT headquarters, and the day was lots of fun,’ says Wright, before noting that 100% of students fed back that they’d like to attend another Booster Day. One student said, “My experience was great today. I learnt a lot and am more confident in Chemistry now!”
‘It is great that we have had such an overwhelmingly positive response to the Bright Young Things Booster Day,’ said Wright. ‘We see this a step in the right direction, towards providing quality education to all children, regardless of their socio-economic circumstances.’",it wa last week reported that the university diversity drive is failing britain poorest student statistic released by uca the admission body showed that there were university application from the uk richest postcode area for the september intake compared to a meagre application from student living in the poorest area despite this shocking disparity one of london leading private tuition agency which can charge up to per hour for tuition ha taken action to combat this imbalance in the education sector bright young thing whose client include royalty ha partnered with the access project a charity supporting bright young people from disadvantaged background to get to top university the aim of the partnership is to provide quality education to all said a spokesperson for the agency according to the sutton trust of privately educated child in london received private tuition in despite the positive of child improving their confidence and attainment this figure sadly demonstrates an increase in inequality the of child in the uk who are privately educated are also by far the most likely to be further supported by private education only of the of student in the uk not at private school receive tuition and within these student are the staggeringly large of secondary school pupil in the uk who are eligible for free school meal unfortunately again according to the sutton trust research these student only currently make up of the intake at the uk most selective university charity such a the access project have been fighting to challenge these odds by working with motivated student from le privileged background over five year to offer them a stronger chance of meeting their potential bright young thing ha created a collaboration with them in order to also reach out to these student booster day booster day are designed to bring access project student from around london together for a day close focus on one subject the first session on april th focused on chemistry a subject that many student struggle with and for which there is a shortage of tutor led by bright young thing tutor james weber and developed by bright young thing carys wright the day focused on topic that were preselected by the student and approached in a range of way the student were a joy to have in byt headquarters and the day wa lot of fun say wright before noting that of student fed back that theyd like to attend another booster day one student said my experience wa great today i learnt a lot and am more confident in chemistry now it is great that we have had such an overwhelmingly positive response to the bright young thing booster day said wright we see this a step in the right direction towards providing quality education to all child regardless of their socioeconomic circumstance,"['shortage', 'april', 'student', 'socioeconomic', 'tutor', 'charity', 'tuition', 'disadvantaged', 'inequality', 'poorest']"

The organisation, which is run in partnership with the Great Run series, aims to get a total of 55,000 children running by the end of the 2018.
Since starting in 2013, GO Run For Fun has already welcomed over 200,000 young runners across its events in the UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Mexico and the USA.
As well as aiming to deliver 20 mass running events across the UK, GO Run For Fun has plans to introduce a full Health & Wellbeing Programme to support the initiative. The organisation is also continuing to focus on its global reach, delivering free running events across nine countries this year.
Children’s health has been hitting UK headlines recently, with Public Health England suggesting 22.6 percent of children aged 4-5 and 34.3 percent of children aged 10-11 are overweight or obese.
GO Run For Fun wants to challenge these statistics by introducing running as a fun, free activity, where children can enjoy themselves and achieve something, all while taking part in physical exercise. The organisation will also provide a Health & Wellbeing Programme alongside each UK event, to educate young children about the importance of diet and regular exercise.

A star for STARS as rural schools consultation draws to a close – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'Educational event', 'News', 'State schools']","March 28, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/a-star-for-stars-as-rural-schools-consultation-draws-to-a-close/,"Save Tynedale’s Amazing Rural Schools (STARS) has stepped up its campaigning as the controversial school consultations for the West of Northumberland draw to a close.
Parents and children created a massive star formation in a field at Wheelbirks Farm on Sunday 25th March. Drone footage of the human formation was captured by FlyPro-UK Limited.
“We filmed on a lovely sunny day at Wheelbirks, where families from schools across the area came together to celebrate our wonderful rural schools,” said Sarah Dick, spokesperson for STARS. “We decided to create the star formation as a symbol of our unity and strength as a school system that works for rural communities.”
The rest of the week has been spent “star showering” all 16 of the rural schools that could close across West Northumberland under unpopular proposals put forward by the Northumberland County Council (NCC).
The parents and children of the schools, representing nearly half of all those in this part of the region, were greeted as they entered the school gates with displays of stars, one for every student at the school.
Several volunteers from the STARS campaign were involved in “Operation Starry Night”, travelling over 100 miles in an effort to ensure that every child in every school received his or her own unique star.
Helen Hunter, a Broomley First School parent and keen craftswoman, made thousands of stars by hand, with help from some of her friends. The delicate crochet, felt and pipe cleaner star garlands were left with a special note for each school, including the following message:
“Like the dark skies of rural Northumberland, each school in the Haydon Bridge and Hexham Partnerships contain a galaxy of the brightest stars – our children. Some galaxies are small, some are larger, but all shine brightly in their individual, unique and wonderful settings.”
“Each school is unique and special, and working together they provide a wonderful educational experience for the children of West Northumberland.”
“The current consultation seems to neglect how well these schools fit their purpose, and their environments. It also appears to devalue the education that our children already receive. We think your pupils are amazing and we’ve left a star for each of them.”
It ended with a plea that NCC councillors would “realise that the consultation into education in the west of Northumberland is not about the movement of units from one place to another, but is about providing our children with the best place for them to shine.”
In Hexham, the Hadrian Learning Trust consultation on whether to move to a two-tier (primary and secondary) model closes to the public on Thursday 29 March.
The academy is outside of the control of Northumberland County Council, but its decisions are expected to have a significant impact on the outcome of the council’s broader consultation.
Northumberland County Council’s schools consultation ends on the 9th April 2018. STARS is planning a protest outside County Hall to mark that day. It will hand over petitions signed by over 10,000 parents calling for rural schools to be saved and the unpopular proposals to be scrapped.

Primary pupils have lessons in aiming high at work – Education Today,"['Attainment', 'Careers', 'Charity', 'Community engagement', 'News', 'Primary schools']","March 26, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/primary-pupils-have-lessons-in-aiming-high-at-work/,"Primary school children are to be linked with supportive communities of volunteers from the world of work who can broaden their jobs horizons and boost their aspirations for the future.
The innovative programme is the first of its kind in the country to work with primary students in this way. An initial pilot is taking place in eight schools in Knowsley, an area chosen because of its good primary schools which service wards of significant deprivation.
Run by the national education charity Future First, the scheme will help each participating school to establish a supportive network of former students and volunteers who will return to the classroom to share their experiences of the working world with current pupils. Building on the charity’s already successful work in more than a thousand secondary schools and colleges across Britain, the programme will help primary schools for the first time to harness the time, talent and resource of their former students.
During this academic year, Future First will deliver a series of four workshops with Year 5 pupils, supported by alumni and volunteers in a range of jobs. Each session will be designed to broaden students’ aspirations about the opportunities available to them after school and will culminate with a visit to a local employer to see the world of work first hand.
Future First is calling for supporters of the schools to sign up and support the programme. Former students and friends of the school, including parents, grandparents and governors, are all encouraged to volunteer their support at http://www.futurefirst.org.uk/register. Volunteers can help the programme by participating in one or more workshops, sharing their experience of life after school with current pupils.
Future First believes every state school, primary and secondary, should be supported by an alumni community which can have a deep and sustained impact on current students’ aspirations and ideas about their futures. This programme will deliver that by ensuring children think about their career options early.
Future First Chief Executive Matt Lent said, “It’s hard for young children to understand the connection between their school studies and the world of work. The importance of engaging children early in their lives about life after school was demonstrated by the number of schools which applied to take part in this pilot.
“Our work in secondary schools has already shown that relatable role models can have an enormous positive influence on the confidence and motivation of young people. This new initiative will take these opportunities to primary pupils for the first time ensuring all children have the chance to succeed regardless of their background.”
Schools taking part are Plantation Primary School, Prescot Primary School, Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Primary School,  Stockbridge Village Primary School, St Anne’s Catholic Primary School, St Mark’s Catholic Primary School,  St Margaret Mary’s Catholic Junior School and St Michael and All Angels Primary School.",primary school child are to be linked with supportive community of volunteer from the world of work who can broaden their job horizon and boost their aspiration for the future the innovative programme is the first of it kind in the country to work with primary student in this way an initial pilot is taking place in eight school in knowsley an area chosen because of it good primary school which service ward of significant deprivation run by the national education charity future first the scheme will help each participating school to establish a supportive network of former student and volunteer who will return to the classroom to share their experience of the working world with current pupil building on the charity already successful work in more than a thousand secondary school and college across britain the programme will help primary school for the first time to harness the time talent and resource of their former student during this academic year future first will deliver a series of four workshop with year pupil supported by alumnus and volunteer in a range of job each session will be designed to broaden student aspiration about the opportunity available to them after school and will culminate with a visit to a local employer to see the world of work first hand future first is calling for supporter of the school to sign up and support the programme former student and friend of the school including parent grandparent and governor are all encouraged to volunteer their support at future first belief every state school primary and secondary should be supported by an alumnus community which can have a deep and sustained impact on current student aspiration and idea about their future this programme will deliver that by ensuring child think about their career option early future first chief executive matt lent said it hard for young child to understand the connection between their school study and the world of work the importance of engaging child early in their life about life after school wa demonstrated by the number of school which applied to take part in this pilot our work in secondary school ha already shown that relatable role model can have an enormous positive influence on the confidence and motivation of young people this new initiative will take these opportunity to primary pupil for the first time ensuring all child have the chance to succeed regardless of their background school taking part are plantation primary school prescot primary school saint peter and paul catholic primary school stockbridge village primary school st anne catholic primary school st mark catholic primary school st margaret mary catholic junior school and st michael and all angel primary school,"['college', 'employer', 'academic', 'grandparent', 'education', 'parent', 'classroom', 'student', 'charity', 'volunteer']"
Raynes Park High School becomes first state school to be an accredited Tim Henman Foundation/BECSLink Community – Education Today,"['News', 'Sport & Play', 'State schools', 'Student engagement']","March 23, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/raynes-park-high-school-becomes-first-state-school-to-be-an-accredited-tim-henman-foundation-becslink-community/,"Tim Henman OBE, retired tennis champion, joined Raynes Park High School in south west London, as it became the first state school to be an accredited Tim Henman Foundation BECSLink Community on Friday 16th March. He was joined by Crista Cullen, MBE, Olympic gold medal field hockey player and the Mayor of Merton, Councillor Marsie Skeete.
As an accredited Tim Henman Foundation BECSLink Community, the school works alongside national and local businesses, education charities, and sports and arts organisations to provide resources and learning opportunities for young people. This offers students and teachers not only from the school, but also other local schools the opportunity to develop new skills.
On Friday 16th March, the school hosted 400 schoolchildren from other local schools who participated in a range of activities. These included music workshops with Tenors Unlimited, the international operatic trio, Pi-Top computer workshop and a catering challenge. Sporting activities were led by Wimbledon Hockey, Fulham Football and Performance Plus.
Kirsten Heard, head teacher, Raynes Park High School, said “We are proud to become the first state school accredited as a BECSLink community. This has all been made possible through the vision of BECSLink and the Tim Henman Foundation and my team at our school. BECSLink’s role as the social mobility network, together with their partners from national and local businesses, education charities, and sports and arts organisations are helping us supply outstanding resources and learning opportunities for students and teachers not only from our school, but also from other local schools.”
Tim Henman, OBE, retired tennis champion, said “This day was all about the children – it was wonderful to see their enthusiasm in such a range of activities. I like to think they can achieve great things in the future. It’s important for youngsters to seize every opportunity and I’m pleased through my Foundation to give back in such a wonderful way in association with not only the scholarships but also in supporting further enrichment programmes with Raynes Park High School in the areas of science, technology, engineering and maths, computer coding, through sport and helping the growth of a community tennis programme.”
Crista Cullen, MBE, Olympic gold medal field hockey player: “It’s great to see the children engaging in a realm of different things from singing to tennis. It’s all part of creating well rounded individuals and giving opportunities to children who wouldn’t otherwise have them.”
BECSLink encourages collaboration at a local and national level to create exciting learning opportunities for young people.
Richard Garrett, CEO of BECSLink says: ““Raynes Park High School will be the leading model for us in the state sector. Any other schools which want to become BECSLink Community hosts should get in touch with us. There are compelling reasons to do so.  Accredited BECSLink Communities have improved reputation and school rolls and greater access to external funding. The model unlocks talent and fulfils the potential for all involved in the associated schools and most particularly for students who face adversity.  Accredited BECSLink Communities become the heartbeat of an integrated community of business, education, charity and sports and arts organisations that want to address social mobility issues through creating opportunities for young people.”
As part of this initiative, the school was given Tim Henman Scholarships, in association with the Tim Henman Foundation, for talented youngsters prevented from pursuing their talents due to a lack of financial means. Mr Henman presented these students with their scholarships on the same day. The school has been awarded a grant over three years by the Foundation to be awarded as scholarships to students.",tim henman obe retired tennis champion joined raynes park high school in south west london a it became the first state school to be an accredited tim henman foundation becslink community on friday th march he wa joined by crista cullen mbe olympic gold medal field hockey player and the mayor of merton councillor marsie skeete a an accredited tim henman foundation becslink community the school work alongside national and local business education charity and sport and art organisation to provide resource and learning opportunity for young people this offer student and teacher not only from the school but also other local school the opportunity to develop new skill on friday th march the school hosted schoolchildren from other local school who participated in a range of activity these included music workshop with tenor unlimited the international operatic trio pitop computer workshop and a catering challenge sporting activity were led by wimbledon hockey fulham football and performance plus kirsten heard head teacher raynes park high school said we are proud to become the first state school accredited a a becslink community this ha all been made possible through the vision of becslink and the tim henman foundation and my team at our school becslinks role a the social mobility network together with their partner from national and local business education charity and sport and art organisation are helping u supply outstanding resource and learning opportunity for student and teacher not only from our school but also from other local school tim henman obe retired tennis champion said this day wa all about the child it wa wonderful to see their enthusiasm in such a range of activity i like to think they can achieve great thing in the future it important for youngster to seize every opportunity and im pleased through my foundation to give back in such a wonderful way in association with not only the scholarship but also in supporting further enrichment programme with raynes park high school in the area of science technology engineering and math computer coding through sport and helping the growth of a community tennis programme crista cullen mbe olympic gold medal field hockey player it great to see the child engaging in a realm of different thing from singing to tennis it all part of creating well rounded individual and giving opportunity to child who wouldnt otherwise have them becslink encourages collaboration at a local and national level to create exciting learning opportunity for young people richard garrett ceo of becslink say raynes park high school will be the leading model for u in the state sector any other school which want to become becslink community host should get in touch with u there are compelling reason to do so accredited becslink community have improved reputation and school roll and greater access to external funding the model unlocks talent and fulfils the potential for all involved in the associated school and most particularly for student who face adversity accredited becslink community become the heartbeat of an integrated community of business education charity and sport and art organisation that want to address social mobility issue through creating opportunity for young people a part of this initiative the school wa given tim henman scholarship in association with the tim henman foundation for talented youngster prevented from pursuing their talent due to a lack of financial mean mr henman presented these student with their scholarship on the same day the school ha been awarded a grant over three year by the foundation to be awarded a scholarship to student,"['charity', 'hockey', 'teacher', 'champion', 'tennis', 'ceo', 'friday', 'olympic', 'schoolchildren', 'wimbledon']"
St Margaret’s pupil top of the board in national biology competition – Education Today,"['Competition', 'News', 'Science']","March 22, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/st-margarets-pupil-top-of-the-board-in-national-biology-competition/,"A sixth-year pupil at Aberdeen’s only all-girls school, St Margaret’s, has achieved the highest mark in Scotland in a national competition run by the Royal Society of Biology.
Iona Thomas-Wright (17), who has been offered a conditional place at Cambridge University to study Biological Natural Sciences, won a Gold Award after taking part in the annual Biology Olympiad.
This year, approximately 7,800 students aged 16 to 19 – the largest number of participants ever – took part in the Olympiad from more than 630 schools.
The competition consists of two online papers which are sat during school time, and which cover a wide range of biological subjects including biochemistry, molecular biology, ecology and behavioural science. Most of the content is not work that is covered in the school curriculum, so students have to conduct extra reading and studying.
Iona, who was one of three St Margaret’s pupils to take part in the Intermediate Olympiad last year – a precursor for younger students – has been invited to attend an awards ceremony at the Institution of Engineering and Technology in London in the summer.
“The questions were very challenging and so I was very surprised, and pleased, to do so well this year,” said Iona.
“It really helps to have a genuine interest in biology because you have to do quite a bit of additional studying for the test. All pupils who took part receive free membership to the Royal Society of Biology’s online student portal, which gives us access to current research and information, as well as the opportunity to get involved in other events. This is a fantastic way to keep up to date with advances in biology, especially for anyone who is interested in a career in this field.”
Head teacher Anna Tomlinson praised Iona’s commitment and hard work.
“Iona is a fabulous ambassador to our younger pupils,” said Miss Tomlinson. “She is extremely dedicated to her studies and the hard work and perseverance she displays is an example to all those who know her.

"NAHT responds to the latest NFER recruitment and retention research comparing teaching, nursing and police – Education Today","['News', 'Recruitment', 'Unions']","March 21, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/naht-responds-to-the-latest-nfer-recruitment-and-retention-research-comparing-teaching-nursing-and-police/,"The National Foundation for Educational Research yesterday released a new report comparing recruitment and retention figures for teaching, nursing and the police.
The report finds that teachers work the joint highest number of hours annually and have the joint lowest average hourly pay of all three professions. And despite finding that teacher satisfaction levels are relatively high, it does acknowledge a retention crisis.
Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, commented:
“Anyone working in schools knows how rewarding it can be. Teachers are graduates, who have many career choices open to them – they go into teaching with passion, because they care and want to make a difference. But with teachers working the joint highest number of hours annually, with the joint lowest average hourly pay, there is a real danger of them burning out.
“This report shows that teachers are more likely to leave their profession than nurses or police officers – 12.3% per year, compared to 9.9% for nurses and 7.7% for police. While 78% of teachers say they are satisfied with their jobs, 47% said they were unhappy with their amount of leisure time.
“Workload is a huge issue for teachers. NFER state that teachers who leave appear to be motivated by reduced working hours and more opportunities for flexible working. And that, despite popular belief, the long hours that teachers work during term time substantially exceed the amount of extra holiday time they may receive. Unfortunately, many are finding the balance unworkable, and more and more great educators are simply tapping out.”
James Bowen, director of NAHT Edge, said: “The DfE’s own data shows that almost 1 in 3 teachers leave within 5 years of qualifying, and EPI research shows that more than half (52%) of teachers have less than 10 years’ experience. These are people that the profession can ill-afford to lose. Not only is the profession becoming less experienced, we are losing excellent teachers who have the potential to become school leaders in the future.”
Paul Whiteman continued: “Teachers’ real average hourly pay has seen a substantial fall over the last decade – 15% compared to 4% and 11% for nurses and police officers. The case for more money for schools and a lift of the 1% pay cap is overwhelming – and urgent.
“Teachers, nurses and the police are all vitally important to this country, our children, and to the future. We shouldn’t have to compare how badly treated they are; their true value should be reflected in their pay and conditions.”",the national foundation for educational research yesterday released a new report comparing recruitment and retention figure for teaching nursing and the police the report find that teacher work the joint highest number of hour annually and have the joint lowest average hourly pay of all three profession and despite finding that teacher satisfaction level are relatively high it doe acknowledge a retention crisis paul whiteman general secretary of school leader union naht commented anyone working in school know how rewarding it can be teacher are graduate who have many career choice open to them they go into teaching with passion because they care and want to make a difference but with teacher working the joint highest number of hour annually with the joint lowest average hourly pay there is a real danger of them burning out this report show that teacher are more likely to leave their profession than nurse or police officer per year compared to for nurse and for police while of teacher say they are satisfied with their job said they were unhappy with their amount of leisure time workload is a huge issue for teacher nfer state that teacher who leave appear to be motivated by reduced working hour and more opportunity for flexible working and that despite popular belief the long hour that teacher work during term time substantially exceed the amount of extra holiday time they may receive unfortunately many are finding the balance unworkable and more and more great educator are simply tapping out james bowen director of naht edge said the dfes own data show that almost in teacher leave within year of qualifying and epi research show that more than half of teacher have le than year experience these are people that the profession can illafford to lose not only is the profession becoming le experienced we are losing excellent teacher who have the potential to become school leader in the future paul whiteman continued teacher real average hourly pay ha seen a substantial fall over the last decade compared to and for nurse and police officer the case for more money for school and a lift of the pay cap is overwhelming and urgent teacher nurse and the police are all vitally important to this country our child and to the future we shouldnt have to compare how badly treated they are their true value should be reflected in their pay and condition,"['workload', 'decade', 'graduate', 'hourly', 'educator', 'yesterday', 'nursing', 'nurse', 'teacher', 'annually']"

On Thursday 15 March 2018, TSB CEO Dr Paul Pester and space scientist Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock visited St Luke’s Church of England primary school in Formby, Liverpool to help bring the wonders of the universe to life for 60 Year 5 pupils.  The class spent the day designing rockets getting set for lift-off on a top secret mission to colonise Mars.
The workshop – Let’s Build a Rocket – is the result of a collaboration between Professor Stephen Hawking’s daughter Lucy Hawking, TSB and Curved House Kids – a company specialising in educational materials for young people.
Specifically aimed at Key Stage 2 students, the workshop sees students become space explorers who design a rocket for their journey into space.  Incorporating maths, science and art, the initiative has been designed to encourage more children to engage with STEM subjects and to demonstrate the value and impact that numeracy and technology skills can have.
Paul Pester, Chief Executive Officer of TSB said:  “Stephen Hawking has always been a huge inspiration to me.  He was instrumental in fuelling my lifelong love for maths and physics, and it was a real honour to meet him just a couple of years ago.
“As every physicist knows, you can travel anywhere in space and time with just a pencil, a sheet of paper and your imagination.  I want every child

to have the same opportunity to explore the universe as I have had and, even more importantly, see how STEM subjects will give them the foundation to go anywhere and do anything they want to in later life.
“I know first-hand how STEM subjects are the backbone to how we live our lives.  Physics gives you a broad understanding of the world you live in and helps you develop key skills, from problem-solving to being analytical.
“It was fantastic to spend a day building rockets and planning a top secret mission to Mars with the Year 5 class of space explorers at St Luke’s primary school in Liverpool.  Our TSB partners will be delivering our ‘Let’s Build a Rocket’ workshop up and down the country as we do our bit to inspire the next generation of budding scientists!”
Mrs Jenny Harper, Year 5 teacher at St Luke’s C of E Primary School commented:  “I really couldn’t believe it when I received a phone call to say that our school had won TSB’s Let’s Build a Rocket competition.  STEM is of paramount importance to us at our school and it was amazing recognition of all the work we do day in, day out.
“And what a day it was on Thursday – amazing from start to finish.  All of Key Stage 2 were completely and utterly inspired by the assembly, led by Dr Paul and Dr Maggie – making us realise that if we dream big, work hard and try our best, our dreams can come true, no matter what hurdles are placed in our way.

“Year 5 then had the privilege of working with Dr Paul and Dr Maggie to explore why and how we could reach and colonise Mars.  The children loved the workshops and are more excited about STEM than ever before.  It was amazing for the children to meet some ‘real scientists’ as they called them and to realise that science and STEM are a real option for a career.  Science is not just sitting in a lab holding a test tube but can be hanging out of the back of a plane to take photographs of missiles!”
Sharon Cowey, Headteacher at St Luke’s C of E Primary School added:  “We have redesigned our curriculum over recent years, to make it as creative and relevant as possible, taking advantage of first hand experiences for the children, so TSB’s Let’s Build a Rocket competition fitted perfectly.  We encourage our children to reach for the stars!  It was wonderful for them to see that scientists are real people and that a STEM-related career is a real possibility.”",formby liverpool chief executive paul pester running a workshop hosted by tsb at st luke ce primary school in professional on thursday march tsb ceo dr paul pester and space scientist dr maggie aderinpocock visited st luke church of england primary school in formby liverpool to help bring the wonder of the universe to life for year pupil the class spent the day designing rocket getting set for liftoff on a top secret mission to colonise mar the workshop let build a rocket is the result of a collaboration between professor stephen hawking daughter lucy hawking tsb and curved house kid a company specialising in educational material for young people specifically aimed at key stage student the workshop see student become space explorer who design a rocket for their journey into space incorporating math science and art the initiative ha been designed to encourage more child to engage with stem subject and to demonstrate the value and impact that numeracy and technology skill can have paul pester chief executive officer of tsb said stephen hawking ha always been a huge inspiration to me he wa instrumental in fuelling my lifelong love for math and physic and it wa a real honour to meet him just a couple of year ago a every physicist know you can travel anywhere in space and time with just a pencil a sheet of paper and your imagination i want every child formby liverpool chief executive paul pester during a workshop hosted by tsb at st luke ce primary school in professional to have the same opportunity to explore the universe a i have had and even more importantly see how stem subject will give them the foundation to go anywhere and do anything they want to in later life i know firsthand how stem subject are the backbone to how we live our life physic give you a broad understanding of the world you live in and help you develop key skill from problemsolving to being analytical it wa fantastic to spend a day building rocket and planning a top secret mission to mar with the year class of space explorer at st luke primary school in liverpool our tsb partner will be delivering our let build a rocket workshop up and down the country a we do our bit to inspire the next generation of budding scientist mr jenny harper year teacher at st luke c of e primary school commented i really couldnt believe it when i received a phone call to say that our school had won tsbs let build a rocket competition stem is of paramount importance to u at our school and it wa amazing recognition of all the work we do day in day out and what a day it wa on thursday amazing from start to finish all of key stage were completely and utterly inspired by the assembly led by dr paul and dr maggie making u realise that if we dream big work hard and try our best our dream can come true no matter what hurdle are placed in our way formby liverpool uka workshop hosted by tsb at st luke ce primary school in professional year then had the privilege of working with dr paul and dr maggie to explore why and how we could reach and colonise mar the child loved the workshop and are more excited about stem than ever before it wa amazing for the child to meet some real scientist a they called them and to realise that science and stem are a real option for a career science is not just sitting in a lab holding a test tube but can be hanging out of the back of a plane to take photograph of missile sharon cowey headteacher at st luke c of e primary school added we have redesigned our curriculum over recent year to make it a creative and relevant a possible taking advantage of first hand experience for the child so tsbs let build a rocket competition fitted perfectly we encourage our child to reach for the star it wa wonderful for them to see that scientist are real people and that a stemrelated career is a real possibility,"['daughter', 'teacher', 'science', 'professor', 'thursday', 'ceo', 'rocket', 'scientist', 'headteacher', 'physicist']"

Major consultation launched on children’s health and physical activity – Education Today,"['Community engagement', 'News', 'Sport & Play', 'Wellbeing']","March 16, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/major-consultation-launched-on-childrens-health-and-physical-activity/,"Photo Mark Earthywww.earthyphotography.co.ukThis image is protected by Copyright
ukactive has launched a major new consultation that will shape the future of children’s physical activity across the UK.
Chair of ukactive and former Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson has called for everyone from children and physical activity providers to social workers and policymakers, to feed into a new report focused on the opportunities to improve children’s health.
ukactive wants written evidence which captures the views of children, young people, parents, teachers, activity providers, social workers, policy experts, business leaders, healthcare professionals and anyone else with a stake in children’s health, to help plot the next chapter in the health of Britain’s children.
The consultation will focus on developing opportunities in three key areas: the organisations and institutions that children and young people experience; the physical environment that children and young people grow up in; and the social environment that children interact with.
The evidence will feed into a new report that will be published at ukactive’s National Summit on 12 September 2018.
It follows the publication of ukactive’s Generation Inactive in 2015, a ground-breaking report that laid bare the physical inactivity crisis facing Britain’s children.
The findings and recommendations led the debate in the media and Westminster, generating momentum behind the children’s activity agenda.
Chair of ukactive Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson said: “Our next report will take us from playground to policy, so this is a chance for you to have your say and fundamentally change the way we approach children’s health through physical activity.
“It seems every day now we read more headlines about rising obesity among our children, but we must take a far broader view of children’s health, with a focus on the proven benefits of physical activity as well as diet.
“We want to hear from the experts on what really works for our children; how best to engage them in physical activity so they can build good habits that last a lifetime and massively reduce their risk not only of obesity but also cancer, diabetes and heart disease.
“Children’s health is key to their happiness and wellbeing, and healthy children are more likely to grow into the healthy, productive adults our society needs.
“It takes a whole community to raise a child and that is why ukactive needs your help to build the evidence base and shape the physical activity landscape for young people.
“By sharing your success stories from our playgrounds, activity centres and communities, you will be telling the UK – and those operating in the corridors of power – what really works for our kids.”
Leading educationalist Adrian Packer, CEO of CORE Education Trust and Chair of the ukactive Kids Council, said: “This is an unmissable opportunity to shape the future of children’s health.
“In order to develop a truly holistic approach to children’s physical activity across the UK, we need more evidence of what works, from those who know this area best.
“This consultation has the potential to play a crucial role in driving children’s physical activity up the national agenda, helping us to shape policy and tackle the multiple threats to Generation Inactive.
“This is about much more than waistlines ­– it’s about the overall health and mental wellbeing of our children.
“We know the best way to address these challenges is by making physical activity more accessible and providing more opportunities for everyone, although how we do that depends on the evidence we receive.”

Sports stars back project to help Greater Manchester kids stay mentally healthy – Education Today,"['Mental health', 'News', 'Wellbeing']","March 14, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/sports-stars-back-project-to-help-greater-manchester-kids-stay-mentally-healthy/,"One in ten children experience a mental health difficulty and now Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, the body overseeing the devolution of the area’s health and social care budget is launching a rapid schools pilot, with the help of world-class athletes, to support the emotional wellbeing of pupils.
Over 30 schools across Greater Manchester will be the first to benefit from specialist support for both pupils and teachers. Athletes such as world champion, Thai boxer Rachael Mackenzie and former England hockey star, Charlotte Hartley, will work with pupils across primary and secondary schools together with special educational needs schools and pupil referral units. Students will be supported to build their confidence and reach their full potential; coached in key life skills such as growing their self-esteem, learning creative thinking skills and coping strategies for challenges.
Each school will have a lead for mental health and they will be trained to understand and spot the signs of mental health issues in children and young people such as anxiety and stress. Teachers will be supported to work more effectively with children and young people experiencing mental health problems, In addition, they will have support and consultation directly with a specialist mental health team who will provide advice, information and support schools to access appropriate services if needed, in a timely way.
The programme is a new collaboration between Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, the Alliance for Learning Teaching School (part of Bright Futures Educational Trust), the Youth Sport Trust, 42nd Street and Place2Be. Schools from across Greater Manchester will be involved in the pilot that will launch over the next couple of months. The vision is that the pilot will inform a Greater Manchester programme for all schools and colleges to access and benefit from.
This schools pilot is part of a major £134m four-year action plan to help to transform mental health in Greater Manchester, announced in July by Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership.

"The government has ‘a moral duty to act’ to increase funding for children with high needs, says NAHT – Education Today","['Funding', 'News', 'Social issues', 'Unions']","March 13, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-government-has-a-moral-duty-to-act-to-increase-funding-for-children-with-high-needs-says-naht/,"As the Chancellor delivers his Spring statement today, school leaders’ union NAHT is warning that young people with the highest needs are paying the most acute price for the government’s decision not to fund schools fully.
Today, NAHT publishes figures from its annual survey of school budgets. The survey showed that 86 percent of school leaders believe that the government is underfunding the additional needs of children, causing major financial pressures.
When asked what actions school leaders were taking to try to make their budget balance for this year, 79.65 per cent said, ‘Reducing the number or hours of teaching assistants’ and 47.26 per cent said ‘Reducing non-educational support and services for children.’
Valentine Mulholland, head of policy at NAHT says: “School budgets are at breaking point and we need some substantial additional investment. Schools are absolutely pared back to the bone and now their only means to make savings is to cut back on staff costs. Pupils who require support will be hit hardest. To support these students, staff need regular updates to their training and we have evidence that this is also being cut.
Marijke Miles, acting head of Baycroft school, a special needs secondary in Hampshire, called the cuts “short-sighted”. She said: “All too often, the successes of my students happen despite the system, not because of it. And that can’t be right. The system is creaking because it is underfunded. This reduces students’ aspirations and it is very harmful for their wellbeing.”
Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said: “NAHT represents the vast majority of school leaders running special schools and alternative provision, and those settings are some of the best in the world. They deliver amazing results every day to enable children and young people to live up to their potential. But it’s at risk if we don’t secure more high needs funding for schools, and more of the critical health and social care funding that these pupils need. The Chancellor has a moral duty to act on high needs funding.”

Royal visit focuses attention on attracting young people into STEM – Education Today,"['Careers', 'Community engagement', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Secondary schools', 'State schools', 'STEM']","March 12, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/royal-visit-focuses-attention-on-attracting-young-people-into-stem/,"The major skills shortage facing manufacturing and technology businesses would be relieved by attracting more women into STEM sectors, according to the female head of Birmingham’s Millennium Point – which majors on access to STEM education in the Midlands.
Millennium Point hosted HRH Prince Harry and his fiancée Meghan Markle at a major event to coincide with International Women’s Day and brought together 90 female students from secondary schools to inspire women to work in STEM. Female leaders in STEM fields told their life-stories to students as part of an event in conjunction with STEMettes, the award-winning social initiative.
In their first visit to Birmingham, Prince Harry and Ms. Markle spoke extensively to the young women from secondary schools in the Midlands as they took part in building apps and touchpads, before hearing more about their motivations to pursue STEM subjects.
Later the students described their discussions with Prince Harry and Ms. Markle as “brilliant”.
 
“They were very friendly and wanted to know what we wanted to do – and were very encouraging,” said one student who said that Prince Harry in particular was interested in VR technology. Another said she would have liked Prince Harry as her brother.
Judith Armstrong, CEO of Millennium Point – an accountant by profession – told the Royal visitors and students of her own story, being inspired by her mother who at one point had never enjoyed maths but then took an interest that encouraged her daughter.
“Everyone was captivated by Prince Harry and Meghan and delighted they spent so much time meeting and chatting to the students. It was very relaxed and I have no doubt that they and our female leaders in STEM sectors were a great inspiration.
“But this was not just a photo opportunity. Working with Stemettes, we have helped demonstrate both the needs of business and the opportunities for females in STEM.
“Just 21% of those working in core STEM occupations in 2016 are women. That is 13,000 more than the previous year – but there are 218,000 more men in Core STEM – resulting in a 1% drop in the percentage of women.
“The estimated STEM worker shortfall is now around 70,000 a year. Encouraging young women to pursue careers in STEM is vital.”
During the past four years, Millennium Point’s commercial activity has enabled Millennium Point Trust to donate more than £4m to organisations, projects and initiatives that support access to STEM related education in the Midlands including working with Birmingham City University’s Faculty of Computing, Engineering and The Built Environment to offer a free undergraduate STEM degree. The Millennium Point scholarship is now in its fourth year.
“Millennium Point is the West Midlands’ focal point for promoting STEM and is committed to providing the young people of the region with the opportunities to be the pioneers of the future. Being able to showcase the Stemettes event and the work of Millennium Point and its Trust to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on International Women’s day was a great honour.

LGA responds to CQC report on children’s mental health – Education Today,"['Mental health', 'News', 'Social issues', 'Wellbeing']","March 8, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/lga-responds-to-cqc-report-on-childrens-mental-health/,"Responding to a report from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) on children and young people’s mental health needs, Cllr Richard Watts, Chair of the Local Government Association’s Children and Young People Board, said:
“Action to tackle the crisis in children and young people’s mental health is long overdue and this report reinforces the urgent need to support children and families in desperate need of help.
“We are pleased the Government is taking steps to address this, but as this report notes, these measures need to be fast-tracked to protect children and young people from avoidable mental health problems.
“The reality is that all children need support, but they are having to wait 18 months before they receive vital support and guidance, which is clearly unacceptable.
“That is why we are calling on government to fund on-site school counselling services in every school. This would help ensure children can access the support as early as they need without having to go on a waiting list, as well as reduce overall demand on specialist services.
“We support the report’s call for children and young people’s mental health to become a higher priority across the whole of government. We want this to inform the Government’s green paper on children’s mental health to deliver the long-term root and branch reform it so desperately needs and ensure the system speeds up, rather than delays, children asking for help.
“The Government needs to further address the crisis in children’s services in its forthcoming Spring Statement.”
The Government has pledged a total of £1.7 billion to promoting, protecting and improving children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing. The LGA is calling for 5 per cent of this funding – £90 million – to be used to make it mandatory for every pupil in secondary and alternative education provision, to have access to on-site school counselling services.

Radio host Nick Grimshaw backs alumni networks in Oldham state schools – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Community engagement', 'News', 'State schools']","February 26, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/radio-host-nick-grimshaw-backs-alumni-networks-in-oldham-state-schools/,"Former state students in Oldham are to help transform current students’ opportunities and give them a better start in life by going back to their old schools in an initiative to build an alumni network in schools and college in the town.
The programme, run by the education charity Future First and funded by the government’s Careers and Enterprise Company, has been backed by the TV and radio broadcaster Nick Grimshaw who went to Our Lady’s RC High School in Royton, now known as Blessed John Henry Newman Catholic College.
Future First is urging alumni of the participating schools and colleges to sign up online at https://networks.futurefirst.org.uk/register to support the programme, which could change young people’s lives.
The initiative will encourage more schools to see alumni as a valuable resource in broadening the jobs horizons of the current generation and preparing them to navigate the difficult transition from school to work. Private schools and universities have long seen the value of keeping alumni in close contact after they have left.
Oldham schools taking part are Failsworth School, Oasis Academy Oldham, Royton and Crompton School, The Radclyffe School, Oldham Sixth Form College and Blessed John Henry Newman Roman Catholic College which Nick attended from 1995 to 2000 when it was known as Our Lady’s RC High School.
Nick said, “It’s great to show the students of Oldham that the world is their oyster. You can do whatever you want in your life and career – you just need to figure out how to do it and how to make it happen. By taking former students back into the classroom, Future First is doing a fantastic job of showing young people the huge range of jobs out there which will broaden their horizons. ”
Christine Gilbert, Executive Chair of Future First and a former Ofsted Chief Inspector said, “Every state school student should have the opportunity to succeed in life after school, regardless of their background. Alumni help give them a better start in life.  If students see ‘people like me’ have succeeded, they are more likely to believe they can too. They work harder and have higher expectations of success. We want more schools to see the benefits of using their alumni as a powerful resource.”
Future First has worked with more than a thousand schools and colleges up and down the country to set up alumni networks. These harness the wealth of talent and experience from former students in a range of jobs, from law and banking to plumbing and catering. More than 220,000 former students nationwide are already registered to support their old school.",former state student in oldham are to help transform current student opportunity and give them a better start in life by going back to their old school in an initiative to build an alumnus network in school and college in the town the programme run by the education charity future first and funded by the government career and enterprise company ha been backed by the tv and radio broadcaster nick grimshaw who went to our lady rc high school in royton now known a blessed john henry newman catholic college future first is urging alumnus of the participating school and college to sign up online at the initiative will encourage more school to see alumnus a a valuable resource in broadening the job horizon of the current generation and preparing them to navigate the difficult transition from school to work private school and university have long seen the value of keeping alumnus in close contact after they have left oldham school taking part are failsworth school oasis academy oldham royton and crompton school the radclyffe school oldham sixth form college and blessed john henry newman roman catholic college which nick attended from to when it wa known a our lady rc high school nick said it great to show the student of oldham that the world is their oyster you can do whatever you want in your life and career you just need to figure out how to do it and how to make it happen by taking former student back into the classroom future first is doing a fantastic job of showing young people the huge range of job out there which will broaden their horizon christine gilbert executive chair of future first and a former ofsted chief inspector said every state school student should have the opportunity to succeed in life after school regardless of their background alumnus help give them a better start in life if student see people like me have succeeded they are more likely to believe they can too they work harder and have higher expectation of success we want more school to see the benefit of using their alumnus a a powerful resource future first ha worked with more than a thousand school and college up and down the country to set up alumnus network these harness the wealth of talent and experience from former student in a range of job from law and banking to plumbing and catering more than former student nationwide are already registered to support their old school,"['broadening', 'catholic', 'education', 'alumnus', 'classroom', 'college', 'online', 'student', 'university', 'charity']"
Historic England asks teachers to explore our prehistory with new resources – Education Today,"['History', 'KS1', 'KS2', 'KS3', 'KS4', 'KS5', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Secondary schools', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources']","February 1, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/historic-england-asks-teachers-to-explore-our-prehistory-with-new-resources/,"Historic England has created a new free online resource designed to help teachers explore the story of Britain’s prehistory with their pupils. Spanning the entire period from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, the interactive timeline gives teachers a vivid visual representation of how Britain’s landscape and inhabitants changed in the 400,000 years from the Palaeolithic era to 43AD.
The timeline features images of the kind of evidence that exists for Britain’s oldest inhabitants: footprints, bones and tools, as well as interactive maps showing important archaeological sites around the country. Through a series of visuals, the timeline illustrates the changing climate and geography of Britain – as it evolved from being a part of the same landmass as France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, to its eventual isolation as an island.
The timeline works well alongside other Historic England online resources, for example the teaching notes, presentations and activities exploring life in  Bronze Age Britain through the exciting story of the recent excavation at Must Farm in Cambridgeshire; and a whole range of images for the period featuring archaeological sites around the country, tools and remains and modern reconstructions of homes and settlements.
Catherine McHarg, Archive Education Manager at Historic England said: “Our new interactive timeline is a really easy way into learning about prehistory – while still providing high quality, detailed and accurate information for teachers to work from. Teachers have told us that it can be a tricky topic, partly because many of them have not had the opportunity to learn much about the subject before they teach it. On top of that, they are sometimes battling preconceptions with children thinking that prehistory only means the dinosaurs! We hope by bringing all the information together into one place we can help put the period into context for teachers and their pupils – having a dynamic visual prompt of the chronology is a really effective way of doing that.”
The tool is the latest addition to the popular library of free resources and teaching aids on HistoricEngland.org.uk/Education. The library includes  themed collections of images (including castles, cathedrals, children at work and crime and punishment), as well as  ready made presentations and worksheets linked to the curriculum.
All Historic England’s education content has recently been updated and re-presented on its new website.
Catherine McHarg added: “We’re constantly updating what we offer to keep pace with changes in the curriculum and in response to what teachers tell us they need. We’re particularly focused on supporting teachers in working with local heritage, because apart from the difficulty some schools have in working out how to meet the curriculum requirements on this topic, we know that engaging children in the history they see around them every day is one of the best ways of exciting them about the subject. Local heritage projects are also a great way of galvanising children’s pride in their local area and helping them understand the broader span of history and where they fit.”
Historic England has also curated around 10,000 archive and modern images specifically for teachers. The collection offers a comprehensive resource teachers can draw on to illustrate almost any topic or geographical region – the most popular images include a 1920s image of the Bryant and May match factory in London (birthplace of the first British trade union for women), a striking image of Victorian foundrymen in Maidenhead, and World War I Land Army girls at work in the fields of Devon.

Fujitsu launches training course for teachers in a bid to boost digital skills across the UK – Education Today,"['Digital skills', 'News', 'Skills', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources', 'Training']","January 29, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/fujitsu-launches-training-course-for-teachers-in-a-bid-to-boost-digital-skills-across-the-uk/,"Fujitsu has announced the launch of an OCR-backed course (a leading UK awarding body) which will support teachers in developing their own understanding of technology, and it’s application in the world of work. It will focus on the technologies that are impacting the jobs of tomorrow, ensuring UK classrooms are coaching young people to be ready for an even more technologically-advanced world. Candidates will be awarded a professional accreditation – the Fujitsu Digital Badge – upon completion of the course.
Building on the expansion of the ambassador hub programme, the ‘Digital Badge’ initiative will empower teachers as they look to accelerate young people, making sure they develop the right skills for future employment and success. Working with OCR, Fujitsu has identified the technologies that are most in-demand in our increasingly digital industries, on which the programme will be based. These are: Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality (VR)/ augmented reality (AR), cyber security, data analytics and big data, programming and AI (cognitive computing).
Recent research by Fujitsu found that 1 in 4 (73%) of UK businesses admit to a clear lack of digital skills within their business. In addition 87% say attracting digitally native staff will be vital to their success in the next three years. As such Fujitsu is developing this programme which empowers the people in charge of delivering knowledge and building skills for young people – the teachers.
The course will initially involve online exercises around each of the six topics to help assess their level of understanding, and the support needed for the participant to be able to incorporate these topics into a programme of work. Once passed, candidates then progress to face-to-face training. Here candidates will be able to meet others on the programme and hear from Fujitsu – and its partners – on how the technology areas can be brought to life in the classroom.
The programme will be open for applications via the Ambassador Hub on the Fujitsu website in due course.
Regional expansion
The announcement of this new initiative coincides with the news that Fujitsu will be further expanding its ambassador programme into Scotland along with industry partners Intel, NetApp and Ruckus Networks an ARRIS Company.
This extension of the Ambassador Programme will see 10 new innovation hubs open in Scotland by 2019.
In line with the Scottish Government’s own plans to embed digital technology into education, Fujitsu’s mission is to enable a broader spectrum of Scotland’s students to experience learning and teaching that is enhanced by digital technology.
With two innovation hubs currently residing at Border College and Fife College, applications to be one of the ten initial new recruits to the extended programme will be open on the Ambassador Hub from the 1st March. Members of the ambassador programme work with Fujitsu, and their partners, to set up an innovation hub within their institution including the technology itself for students, the local community and local organisations to use.
Ash Merchant, Director Education at Fujitsu UK & Ireland said, “The ambassador programme is going from strength to strength, and we’re incredibly proud to showcase the stories of students who have benefited from it at BETT today. Technology is moving forward at lightning speed and it is transforming the way many organisations – like us – operate and interact with the wider world. As such we’re seeing increased demand for a new set of skills that will carry that transformation forward, and yet we mustn’t forget the key transformational ingredient – our teachers. Teachers sit at the heart of education, connecting bright young minds with the knowledge and skills they will need to succeed in the digital future we’ve created for them. That’s why we’ve made it our mission to provide opportunities for them to develop their own knowledge in key areas of technological development.”
“As one of the original affiliates for the Fujitsu Ambassador Program, we are excited to further extend our collaboration,” said Bart Giordano, vice president of worldwide business development and cloud services, Ruckus Networks. “This joint effort allows us to enable educators and students an enhanced and personalized technology learning experience with seamless connectivity using our latest wireless and wired connectivity solutions in schools, colleges and universities. The robust education program allows educators and students to further develop their digital and career skills.”
“We are excited to participate in the expansion of a successful Ambassador Education programme with Fujitsu,” said Eric Fusilero, VP, Global Enablement and Education, NetApp University at NetApp. “Digital transformation is accelerating our need to forge tighter connections with educators, ensuring students bring the most current skills and competencies to local job markets. Contributing to the community through education is a natural fit for NetApp as we look to empower the data visionaries of the future.”",fujitsu ha announced the launch of an ocrbacked course a leading

Schools plan to increase their ICT spending for the first time in three years – Education Today,"['Funding', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Secondary schools']","January 23, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/schools-plan-to-increase-their-ict-spending-for-the-first-time-in-three-years/,"As the education sector is gathering at the Bett Show on Wednesday to explore the latest trends in educational technology, a new report released on Monday by the British Educational Suppliers Association (BESA) has found that school spending on ICT is set to rise for the first time in three years.
While school budgets are continuing their decline in 2017/18, the report shows that budgets are on the upward in 2018/19, both in primary and secondary English maintained schools. Commissioned by BESA, the research was undertaken by the National Educational Research Panel (NERP) with 557 primary schools and 366 secondary schools.
Primary schools are projected to expand spending on ICT during 2018/19. The increase is likely to equate to an average of £400 per primary school. The overall market impact is forecast to extend spending by around £7m.
For secondary schools, the forecast for 2018/19 is also more positive, with spending expanding by £9m (+3.5%).
While this additional expenditure is welcome, it is much needed. BESA’s research found that only 33% of secondary schools and 60% of primary schools consider that they are sufficiently equipped with ICT infrastructure and devices. Primary schools are therefore planning to dedicate the additional spending to networking and peripherals items, in addition to allocating about a third of their budget to devices for pupils and teachers.
Caroline Wright, Director General of BESA, said: “Seeing schools ready to increase their spending on ICT in 2018/19 is an encouraging sign that schools are increasingly recognising the positive impact educational technology has, when applied well, on pupil performance.
“The Bett Show will likely reflect this change and I expect to see strong interest by teachers as they will witness the infinite potential of EdTech knowing that they now have some additional budget to bring this transformational technology into the classroom.”
On the lack of ICT infrastructure in schools, Caroline Wright said: “Disappointingly two-thirds of secondary schools still say that they are not being sufficiently equipped with ICT infrastructure and devices. There is, therefore, more to do to provide pupils with access to the necessary resources, EdTech tools and skills to enable them to compete in a global skills market.
“These findings show that schools are making a step in the right direction, but it is the first step in the longer marathon of ensuring schools are well resourced in their curriculum and resources budget across the wider system.”

Government urged to back Childline as mental health concerns increase – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Funding', 'Mental health', 'News', 'Wellbeing']","January 22, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/government-urged-to-back-childline-as-mental-health-concerns-increase/,"Childline counselling sessions about mental health issues peaked at 101,454 last year, as stagnant funding from Government prompts call to action.
The number of children seeking help from the NSPCC-run service specifically for mental and emotional health, self-harm or suicidal thoughts and feelings rose 12%.
The NSPCC is calling on Government to increase the amount of funding it gives to Childline to help meet this rising demand, to support children 24 hours a day and to help them before they reach crisis point.
Last year Government proposed in its Green Paper the introduction of mental health support for children and young people in schools.
However, two thirds of Childline counselling sessions about mental health issues took place outside school hours (5pm-9am), demonstrating the additional need for out of hours support.
Some children told counsellors they are being directed to contact Childline after normal working hours by statutory services, such as child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) or local authority children’s services in England.
More than 50,000 referrals to CAMHS were rejected last year with many cases not meeting the clinical threshold.
Childline plays an important role in helping children who are struggling with their mental health, but who do not meet the clinical threshold for access to CAMHS.
At present Childline counsellors can only respond to 3 out of 4 children who need their help, as more and more children are using online counselling which requires more time and resources to answer.
The charity is calling on Government to increase funding for the service so Childline can be there for every child who needs them whether that is during the day, night or at the weekend.
Peter Wanless, Chief Executive of the NSPCC said: “Increasing mental health support in schools will be an important step to ensure more children get the help they need. But we know that children don’t only experience mental health problems during the school day.
“Government funding to Childline has remained the same, whilst demand for counselling about mental health continues to increase. It is vital that Government urgently provides more funding to help children who don’t have access to support elsewhere.”
Childline is reliant on funding from the public, with 80% of it coming from voluntary donations. The charity needs extra help from the Government to ensure the vital service is not vulnerable and can continue to be there for children whenever they need help and someone to talk to.
Dame Esther Rantzen, Founder and President of Childline said: “More young people than ever before tell Childline they are overwhelmed by serious mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, and we are seeing this reflected in the amount of counselling sessions we are delivering. Our counsellors know we are literally saving lives, and it concerns us deeply that we cannot help every child who desperately needs to reach us.
“Childline is often the first place young people come to for help because they know they can talk to us in confidence when they have nowhere else to turn. Childline has been a life-line for millions of children and young people for the past 31 years, and these figures show how much of a vital service Childline continues to be.”
The NSPCC is calling on members of the public to sign their petition to Government asking for Childline to become a more central part of the proposals put forward in the recent Green Paper, and for funding to be increased accordingly.

“Lowerplace like home” for Sir Peter’s Phiz Lab – Education Today,"['KS1', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Science', 'Teaching resources']","January 19, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/lowerplace-like-home-for-sir-peters-phiz-lab/,"Rochdale’s Sir Peter Ogden has opened the latest Phiz Lab at Lowerplace Primary to benefit primary schools across the borough and inspire children into physics.
Sir Peter was back on his old stomping ground as he opened his latest Phiz Lab, only the third one in the North West, to excited pupils at Lowerplace Primary.
Sir Peter and his son, Cameron, were special guests at the school for the afternoon and were treated to a science-themed lunch, a tour of the school and helped the children conduct experiments in the new, dedicated physics lab, before the grand opening.
He attended Lowerplace in the 1950s, where he met his future wife. He later went on to attend Rochdale Grammar School where he won a scholarship for Durham University taking a BSc in physics and a PhD in particle physics before going on to complete an MBA at Harvard Business school in the United States. He later became the co-founder of Computacentre and was knighted in 2005 for services to education.
Sir Peter was thrilled to be back in Rochdale, he said: “It’s exciting to be back at my old primary school. I’ve a lot happy memories of Lowerplace so I’m particularly proud to be opening this Phiz Lab today. Phiz labs are a great opportunity to get children involved at an early age in the wonders of science and I’m pleased to welcome teachers and students from our local cluster of schools who are promoting science education in our primary schools so successfully. “Science is part of our everyday lives and we have a responsibility to ensure our children can understand its basics, its applications and above all its beauty. From simple questions like how does a mobile phone work to more complex investigations on how did the universe come into being – these are all things children should think about. Phiz Lab will hopefully be the first step on that learning journey for these young children.”
The Phiz Lab is based at Lowerplace Primary school but is available for all schools in the borough to use. It is a dedicated lab to enable primary children to learn about physics in an interactive way and inspire them so they may pursue physics for the rest of their education, and hopefully their career.
Councillor Kieran Heakin, cabinet member for children’s services said: “This is a wonderful resource for our primary schools. It is great to see our young people interested and passionate about science, it’s a great career path for them and I hope Sir Peter’s visit, and the Phiz Lab, will inspire them.”
The Odgen Trust was set up in 1999, with a resolute focus on increasing the number of student taking physics at GCSE, A-Level and university and so they actively work to encourage children to become more engaged in physics. Opening Phiz Labs in schools is one way they hope to inspire generations of children.
Garry Johnson, head teacher at Lowerplace Primary, was delighted with Sir Peter’s visit: “We are thrilled to have this fantastic facility here. To have Sir Peter come back to his former primary school is very special. This has been a very memorable day and I’d like to thank him for spending so much time with our children today, I’m sure he’s inspired many of them.”

‘Around the world in 10 days’ with world record breaking cyclist Mark Beaumont for Sustrans Big Pedal 2018 school challenge – Education Today,"['Competition', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Secondary schools', 'Support materials', 'Teaching resources', 'Wellbeing']","January 18, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/around-the-world-in-10-days-with-world-record-breaking-cyclist-mark-beaumont-for-sustrans-big-pedal-2018-school-challenge/,"World record breaking cyclist Mark Beaumont is calling on schools to take up the challenge of ‘Around the world in 10 days’ as part of Sustrans Big Pedal 2018 – a UK-wide event to get more young people cycling and scooting to school.
The Big Pedal 2018, which runs from Monday 23 April to Friday 4 May, will see pupils, parents and teachers across the UK leave their cars at home and get on their bikes and scooters for their journeys to and from school.
During the 10 days participating primary and secondary schools will compete with one another to make the most journeys by bike or scooter. Active travel does not just begin and end at the school gates, it can be incorporated into lively classroom activities and assemblies. The theme of this year’s Big Pedal, ‘Around the world in 10 days’, links to key parts of the geography curriculum, such as being able to name the world’s continents and oceans. Endurance cyclist Mark Beaumont, who holds the Guinness World Record for cycling around the world in 78 days, is backing the Big Pedal 2018. After 18,000 miles on the road last summer, covering 240 miles a day and taking in 16 countries, Mark smashed the previous record by 44 days.
Participating primary and secondary schools will receive a pack of teaching resources, including a map of the world for pupils to track their progress. Pupils will follow Mark’s route around the world, learning about the countries he passed through on his trip via a series of fact cards provided as part of the resources pack. Setting off from the UK, stops along the way include France, Germany, Latvia, China, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Canada and Spain.  Each country’s card will include details such as the capital city and population size, as well as a piece of cycling or scooting related trivia.  Children, parents and teachers will also be able to log, track and compare their journeys online using the Big Pedal website.
Mark said: “I’m delighted to be supporting the Big Pedal 2018.  It’s a great initiative for getting more young people on their bikes and scooters, building their confidence and independence in a fun and engaging way.
“Encouraging young people to cycle and scoot from an early age not only boosts physical and mental health, it also helps build good habits for independent and active travel into teenage and adult life. I hope as many schools as possible will take part in this year’s ‘Around the World in 10 days’ Sustrans’ Big Pedal challenge.”
According to government guidelines, children and young people aged 5 to 18 need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day. Walking, scooting or cycling to school is one way of boosting children’s activity levels and helping them maintain a healthy weight, while reducing congestion and air pollution around the school gates. Teachers find that pupils who walk and cycle arrive at school more relaxed, alert and ready to start the day than those who travel by car.
Organised by walking and cycling charity Sustrans, and sponsored by Micro Scooters and Tonik, the Big Pedal is the largest competition of its kind in the UK. Last year nearly 1,700 schools registered to take part, with teachers, parents, siblings and pupils making more than a million journeys to school by bike or scooter. The Big Pedal 2018 is open to individual classes as well as whole schools, with hundreds of thousands of pupils expected to take part.

Young people need mentors – like you! – Education Today,"['Careers', 'Community engagement', 'News']","January 17, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/young-people-need-mentors-like-you/,"There is a wide range of evidence supporting the key benefits for young people of having an employer mentor, however, many industries and sectors remain heavily underrepresented in providing them.
Launched on Monday 15th January, the next phase of The Careers & Enterprise Company’s #UnexpectedMentor campaign is targeting employees from these underrepresented industries. The campaign is calling on them to volunteer their time and share their experience and skills. The aim is to build a supportive and empathetic relationship to benefit a young person. Evidence shows that for mentoring to be most effective, role models need to be relatable to the young person they are supporting.
The Careers & Enterprise Company initially launched its #UnexpectedMentor campaign in October 2017, to attract new mentors, representative of the whole population. The campaign sets out to change perceptions of who can be a mentor. But data from the first phase shows that many sectors and industries are still significantly underrepresented. Whilst there are exceptions, mentors currently come from relatively similar backgrounds and a limited variety of professions, such as the financial and service sectors.
In contrast, very few mentors come from sectors such as manufacturing, retail and transportation – the three making up less than 10% of recent volunteers.
Employer mentoring is increasingly seen as a valuable way of supporting young people, helping them stay engaged at school and making a successful transition into the world of work. The many positive outcomes associated with employer mentoring include improvements in behaviour, engagement and attainment.
Claudia Harris, Chief Executive of the Careers & Enterprise Company said:
“Many people assume that you need to work in an office and be in a senior role to become a mentor.  But, in reality, people from all walks of life and with all types of experience have the potential to be a great mentor. The most effective mentors are relatable – people who may themselves have left education recently or have similar backgrounds or interests to the young person they’re mentoring.
Businesses need to work with schools and colleges to genuinely achieve diversity in their workforces. There is a huge opportunity for a much more diverse set of mentors across England and we are calling on people to sign up now, to help our young people to prepare for brighter futures.”

Designed to suit an audience aged between 7 and 14 years, the pack includes a series of activities involving discussion, research, a quiz and a creative competition where children can get arty and submit their own skis or snowboard graphic.
Teachers are encouraged to enter their class’ designs for a chance to win some fantastic snowsport prizes, including free snowsports taster sessions at a nearby slope, Rossignol branded goodies and more.  The winning graphic will be selected by former Olympic skier and Ski Sunday presenter Graham Bell, and many of Snowsport England’s favourite entries will be featured on the PyeongChang to Piste and Go Ski Go Board websites, as well as the Snowsport England social media channels.
The PyeongChang to Piste resources pack has relevant curriculum links to the following subjects: Design and technology; art and design, PSHE; English; Geography and PE.
Snowsport England has also confirmed dates for their National Schools Snowsport Week  (www.nssw.co.uk), which will run for the third time in April, just weeks after the conclusion of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics.
Taking place from Monday 23rd until Sunday 29th April 2018, dry and indoor slopes and clubs are set to run free or heavily discounted activities throughout the week, aimed at giving young people from all types of backgrounds the chance to try skiing or snowboarding. For 2018 Snowsport Wales has joined forces with the initiative and will also run National Schools Snowsport Week sessions at slopes and clubs across Wales throughout the week. The sessions will be open to primary and secondary schools, as well as sixth form colleges across England and Wales.
Tim Fawke, Chief Executive of Snowsport England said: “It’s a hugely exciting time for snowsports and we want to ensure anyone inspired by the Winter Olympics have the opportunity to give skiing and snowboarding a go.  The PyeongChang to Piste Schools Resources Pack has a variety of activities to tie in with the school curriculum and get students and teachers engaged in snowsports. There are so many benefits to skiing and snowboarding, from improving balance, co-ordination and core strength to building new friendship groups, we hope many more people will get involved.”

British schools at breaking point due to funding issues – Education Today,"['Mental health', 'News', 'Wellbeing']","January 16, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/british-schools-at-breaking-point-due-to-funding-issues/,"Redundancies, disputes and long-term sickness are amongst the list of worries affecting the mental health and wellbeing of school leaders and teaching staff across the UK.
According to a survey of 500 school workers, which was commissioned by leading Cheshire law firm SAS Daniels, British schools are under increasing strain from HR and employment issues.
In some cases, staff reported tricky HR scenarios leading to them worrying outside of work, affecting their friendships and even making them consider an alternative career path.
More than a quarter (27%) of the schools that were surveyed had suffered redundancies in the last 12 months, with almost one in ten (9.4%) losing four or more staff and almost one in twenty (4.8%) losing six or more staff.
According to the research, dealing with staff sickness has become a particular problem for schools, with three in five (59%) having to deal with long-term sickness in the last year and a further three in five (58%) dealing with repetitive short-term absences over the same period.
Stephen Foster, Employment Law Partner specialising in education at SAS Daniels, said: “We work closely with a number of schools and are only too aware of the pressures they face. Our aim is to take some of the pain of difficult HR issues away from Head Teachers, Governors and school leaders, who already have enough to deal with, leaving them to focus on the pupils.
“A number of the school workers that we surveyed said that they were regularly worrying about redundancies, disputes and staff sickness at least once a term.
“Even more concerning is the fact that this is leaving many school workers feeling stressed about HR issues even when they’re not at work and in some cases, they are considering an alternative career.”
When it comes to stress levels, more than two fifths (45.6%) of school workers are stressed about redundancies, more than a third (34.6%) are stressed about disputes, more than two fifths (41%) feel stressed about long-term sickness and almost half (47.2%) feel stressed about repetitive short-term absences.
Of the school workers surveyed, less than a third (31%) had a designated HR specialist to deal with HR issues. In most other cases, the role fell to the Head Teacher, Deputy Head Teacher or business manager.
 
According to the school workers who were surveyed, the future looks bleak due to funding issues. Nearly half of teachers expect to have to deal with an increase in redundancies in the next two to three years and more than a third (37% and 36%) expect an increase in long-term sickness and repetitive short-term absences.
In fact, two fifths (41.6%) of school workers said that they or their colleagues have considered an alternative career because of redundancies, disputes, long-term sickness or repetitive short-term absences.

More chances for schoolchildren to hold a meteorite! – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News', 'Science', 'Space!']","January 15, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/more-chances-for-schoolchildren-to-hold-a-meteorite/,"A free scheme which allows UK schoolchildren to hold a piece of outer space in their hands has undergone a major revamp and now offers exciting new teaching resources and new meteorite samples.
The Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) has been working with the National Space Academy to update their ‘Borrow the Moon’ kit – which is now available to be loaned to schools.
These packs feature samples of rock brought back from the Moon by the NASA the Apollo mission astronauts as well as a meteorite from Mars, which the children are able to handle. Since the update, the packs now also include a new meteorite hunters kit, a new teacher planning pack and exciting new web-based resources and online support videos for all age groups, from primary to secondary.
The number of kits available to schools has also increased from four to six. The new contents and teaching materials have been developed with teachers to ensure the kits are relevant and accessible. STFC’s Chief Executive Officer, Dr Brian Bowsher, said: “We are thrilled to be able to offer this unique opportunity to young people. It is not often they will be able to see close-up, and actually touch, such important fragments of science history.
“Samples like these are vital in teaching us more about our solar system, allowing us to turning theories into fact. We hope this experience will encourage the students to take up a career in science.”

Achievement for All Education Trust granted sponsor and MAT status – Education Today,"['Academies', 'MATs', 'News']","January 12, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/achievement-for-all-education-trust-granted-sponsor-and-mat-status/,"Achievement for All Education Trust, a not for profit organisation, has been granted Sponsor and Multi Academy Trust status by the Department for Education and will be forming a Multi Academy Trust (MAT). Launching in April 2018, membership of the Multi-Academy Trust will build organically over the following 12 months to include further academies.
Park House School in Newbury has been identified as the Lead School within the South-Central Hub – the first of three potential regional partnership clusters.
Speaking about the Trust and its aspirations, CEO, Professor Sonia Blandford, said: “Over the past two years, Park House School and Achievement for All have been working closely with the Department for Education to design a Multi Academy Trust that puts children and young people at the centre of everything we do.
“The Achievement for All Education Trust will transform lives through improved educational opportunities and outcomes for all children and young people. Our aim is to provide a quality, inclusive education for all pupils of all abilities, including those experiencing challenges, needs or disadvantage, resulting in happy, engaged, motivated learners and staff.
“We want our schools to retain their local identity and autonomy with enhanced capacity to support continuous improvement and opportunities for development within each of the three Hubs. We will do this by creating a family of schools that share common values, champion inclusion and success for all and focus on the ambitions of their students above all else.”
Park House School Headteacher and South-Central Hub Leader, Derek Peaple, said: “The Trust will establish a strong and committed partnership of schools that provide inclusive learning for all. We will offer a breadth of educational opportunity with high expectations for all children and excellent professional learning and development for all staff. We will focus on the further development of high quality teaching and learning and engagement with parents,carers and the wider community. This will enable us to amplify existing school strengths as well as identifying and supporting new opportunities that will lead to outstanding outcomes for all.”
Working in partnership with established school partners with a successful track record in using Achievement for All programmes to support student progress and whole school improvement, the Trust’s activities will be informed by a deep-rooted mission and set of aims that will drive school improvement, develop professionals, improve outcomes for children and young people as well as enhancing inclusion and social mobility.
Achievement for All is national charity that has functioned as an independent body since 2011. The charity works in close partnership with schools, early years settings and colleges as well as a wider range of professionals, including nearly 400 Achievement Coaches that are all former or current experienced teachers and school/setting leaders.

East Anglian coding competition set to reduce skills gap and drive social mobility – Education Today,"['Careers', 'Computing', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Secondary schools', 'STEM']","January 12, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/east-anglian-coding-competition-set-to-reduce-skills-gap-and-drive-social-mobility/,"FXP Festival, a STEM initiative based on a computer and mobile game design and development competition, is now open to entries from secondary schools and colleges across East Anglia. The initiative, which is linked to the computer science curriculum, uses computer games to increase interest and uptake of STEM subjects, build young people’s digital skills and provide an insight into what careers in the technology, creative digital and related industries might offer.
Hosted annually by Cambridge Regional College, FXP Festival delivers an exciting hands-on game development experience, involving students with a wide range of abilities, from those experienced in coding, to individuals more interested in the creative concept and artistry of game design. By engaging local students with computer science, art and design, FXP Festival aims to both drive social mobility in the region and help close the technology skills gap.
Over the course of the Festival weekend (7 – 9 July 2018), teams of students, aged 13-19 (Year 8 – 13, and FE), are tasked with designing an original computer game concept, based on a surprise theme. FXP Festival is supported by major companies in the region’s technology and creative digital sectors, which provide expertise, mentoring and coaching to students and their teachers. 2017 supporters included: Amazon, Anglia Ruskin University, Jagex, Microsoft, ARM, Hacklab, Rizing Games, Cambridge Regional College. The Festival organisers have also created and sourced a range of teaching materials for schools to help them prepare for the weekend, available on the FXP website.
Alison Taylor, Co-founder of the Festival and Managing Director of Conscious Communications, comments: “FXP Festival aims to inspire young people to develop their digital and creative skills, and provides a fun, practical way for students to engage with STEM subjects. The tech industry is facing a huge skills crisis – recent research from CWjobs has revealed that 94% of tech employers believe there is an industry-wide skills shortage, with 60% of employers stating that coding will become a key requirement for entry-level tech positions. With the help of our supporters, FXP Festival is playing an important, grass-roots role in closing this gap.”
Mark Ogilvie, Design Director at Jagex, has been fundamental to the Festival’s success since inception. He commented: “We love getting involved with FXP Festival, the event gives us a unique chance to interact, engage and inspire the next generation of digital talent, whilst teaching the students important skills. As a growing organisation, Jagex is always thinking about its recruitment pipeline, FXP is a fantastic opportunity to meet the young faces that will make up the future of our industry.”
Alison continued: “As well as improving their knowledge of the gaming industry and computer science, FXP Festival gives students and teachers the opportunity to develop valuable team-work, creative and communication skills. Our ambition to drive social mobility is a big factor in the organisation of FXP Festival – the government’s Social Mobility Index has identified Cambridge and East Cambridgeshire as social mobility ‘cold spots’, meaning we are within the worst performing 20% of authorities in the UK. The local industry can take responsibility for changing this trend – by working together to develop innovative approaches, like FXP Festival, we can provide exciting progression opportunities for the young people in our region.”

How shade sails and access to the great outdoors can help children achieve at school – Education Today,"['Buildings & Maintenance', 'News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'School Improvements', 'Sport & Play']","January 11, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/how-shade-sails-and-access-to-the-great-outdoors-can-help-children-achieve-at-school/,"The speed at which technology is developing is having a profound impact on our children and it is interesting to compare their childhood experiences with those of the previous generation.
“10% of children play in the natural environment compared to 40% of adults when they were young”
England Marketing (2009) Report to the Natural England on childhood and nature: a survey on changing relationships with nature across generations.
This is a big shift in how children play and what they experience in their childhood years. The question is how does this impact on their health, personal development and learning?
Health is impacted negatively by not getting enough exercise, leading to increasing rates of obesity in children and adolescents. Children are not playing outside as much as they used to, limiting their exposure to sunlight and thus the generation of vitamin D which helps to fight infection and keeps skin healthy. Sunlight also helps to regulate the production of melatonin which regulates sleep. Electronic devices emit harmful blue light, which can cause headaches and eye strain. Blue light in the evenings can even limit the production of melatonin, which in turn can make going to sleep very difficult for some children.
So what is the answer to this slippery slope that we find ourselves on… More time outside!
With such a lot of time spent at school there is a real opportunity to take these important learnings and increase the options for children to learn and play in the outdoors. Ofsted are in agreement that more time outdoors is of benefit to pupils …
“When planned and implemented well, learning outside the classroom contributed significantly to raising standards and improving pupils’ personal, social and emotional development” 
Ofsted (2008) Learning outside the classroom. How far should you go?
Despite this, a survey has shown that although “97% of teachers believed that schools needed to use their outside spaces effectively to enhance their pupils’ development, 82% did not agree that their own school was making as much use as it can of this valuable resource”
Learning Through Landscapes (2010) Research showing the benefits of outdoor play
So what can be done?
There are a lot of organisations who promote outdoor activities, such as Learning Outside the Classroom, The Outward Bound Trust and The Woodland Trust. Many of these offer ideas for outdoor learning as well as courses for teachers and school resources to download.
In the UK, the weather can often be a barrier to taking children outdoors for regular lessons and it may be that the addition of a school canopy or shade sail, may be just the thing to make sure that your school is not depending on the British weather to get the children in the fresh air.
Imagine a school campus with a custom built outdoor sheltered learning space, which is ready to use every day of the year! What a fabulous way to make sure that your children make the most of the natural world and all the benefits this can bring.
These can take the shape of Umbrella style shelters, Tepees, Shade Sails or steel and polycarbonate school canopies. For a larger sheltered area, a covered MUGA would provide space for all year-round sports and learning activities outdoors. Perhaps a bespoke school canopy would be something to consider, these can be designed specific to the school and made to measure. Whatever the requirement, there will be a school canopy solution to help bring the benefits of outdoor learning to as many children as possible.
“Outdoor learning can benefit pupils of all ages and be successful in a variety of settings… [it] enriches the curriculum and can improve educational attainment” 
Education and Skills Select Committee.

New “garden school” opens in East London – Education Today,"['Construction', 'News', 'Primary schools']","January 11, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-garden-school-opens-in-east-london/,"Architecture Initiative’s new school in east London has opened its doors to over 700 primary school pupils. Designed for Tower Hamlets School Ltd and London Borough of Tower Hamlets, Olga Primary School envisions a ‘garden oasis’ in the heart of the capital city.
The school’s vertical design consolidates 25 classrooms around a naturally-lit atrium with the age of pupils increasing as the building rises. The three-storey, glazed atrium creates a circulation core that separates the structure into two distinct volumes: one accommodates the teaching centre; the other contains the administrative and communal spaces, delivering the added benefit of opening the facility to the wider community outside of generic schooling hours.
Increasing the capacity of the school three-fold creates extra places for pupils that are sorely needed in Tower Hamlets, where demand for places is expected to rise by as much as 38% by 2022. Replacing a single-storey 1982 structure, Architecture Initiative’s design safe-guards the quaint ‘village-feel’ by expanding vertically to avoid sprawling across the site plan and consequently affecting the landscape.
Green space is incredibly important to Olga Primary School and the architect responds to this by incorporating a variety of terraced gardens and trees to create a rare ‘green oasis’ to inspire children within an exciting and unconventional environment. All year groups have immediate access to outside space – the ground floor to the gardens; the first floor to terraces; and the second floor to the roof – linking the pupils with the ecology of the surrounding area. The interior fit-out optimises a small palette of bright aquas and limes to complement the raw materiality of the pale concrete finishes and birch ply interior cladding – expressed in a contemporary, Scandinavian style. Large graphics ensure that the teals and greens of the site’s gardens are brought into the interior.

"Inclusivity festivals inspire over 2,500 children – Education Today","['Community engagement', 'Diversity', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Primary schools']","January 10, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/inclusivity-festivals-inspire-over-2500-children/,"More than 30,960 boccia balls have been thrown and 200 seated volleyball games taken place in a bid to get primary school children across the UK thinking about how they can be more inclusive at school.
There are around 770,000 children in the UK living with disabilities – equal to around one in 20 children. National children’s charity the Youth Sport Trust and Allianz Insurance are celebrating a successful partnership which brought together 2,580 young people with and without Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND).
Since June 2017, a national series of 20 mixed-ability, inclusive, multi-sport festivals have been held in the UK to build on the legacy of the Paralympics and ensure all children have access to sport and physical activity.
Ali Oliver, chief executive of Youth Sport Trust, said: “Our aim through these festivals was to collectively strive to challenge attitudes and perceptions of SEND amongst young people and within their local communities. We brought together more than 100 primary schools to do this.
“Through Allianz Dare to Believe we have achieved so much in the past year in helping to ensure that all children and young people have the opportunities to enjoy sport and the wider benefits of an active lifestyle, but we couldn’t have done it without the support of volunteers, our partner Allianz, and the willingness of all the young people involved.”
The Allianz Dare to Believe programme saw 149 volunteers donating 1,043 hours at the festivals.
David Radford, chief marketing officer for Allianz Insurance, said: “We are very proud to support the Youth Sport Trust through the Allianz Dare to Believe festivals. We’ve had some fantastic feedback about the success of the programme and our employee volunteers have really enjoyed the opportunity to bring young people together and make a difference in their local communities.”
The festivals comprised talks from inspirational Paralympic champions, ‘sport and ‘breakout stations’ where they could try Paralympic sports like Boccia, guided athletics, sitting volleyball and Goalball, as well as have time for informal play and to form new friendships.
Seven-year-old Emma, who took part in the Guildford Dare to Believe festival, said the experience had helped her to put herself in the shoes of a young person with SEND.
“I now know what it must feel like to be blind. This has shown me how I can best talk to someone who is blind, and I am now not scared about doing this,” she said.

UK Space Agency begins search for young space entrepreneurs – Education Today,"['Competition', 'Educational event', 'News', 'Space!', 'STEM']","January 9, 2018",https://www.education-today.co.uk/uk-space-agency-begins-search-for-young-space-entrepreneurs/,"The Swindon-based UK Space Agency is offering young people expert advice for their ideas of how satellites could improve life on Earth and a share of a £50,000 prize.
The SatelLife Challenge, now in its second year, is looking for innovative proposals from those aged 11 to 22 which have the potential to use data collected from space to benefit our economy, health or the environment. Ideas from last year’s competition ranged from solutions to help increase the survival rate of heart attack victims by using GPS trackers in fitness devices, to an app that warns people about impending natural disasters, guides them safely away and alerts emergency services.
Satellites support the economy and everyday life, and this competition gives young people the chance to test their ideas with industry experts and perhaps one day become part of the fastest growing sector of the UK economy. The UK space industry builds 40% of the world’s small satellites and 25% of the world’s telecommunications satellites. It supports 40,000 jobs and generates £14 billion in revenue across the country.
Science minister Jo Johnson said: “Satellites are shaping our society and increasingly important for our economy. Every second they send information around the world, keep shipping lanes and flightpaths clear and help us get to where we want to be.
“Young people today will be an integral part of our mission to grow the UK’s share of the global space market to 10% by 2030, as set out in our industrial strategy. We need to ensure the potential benefits of space are felt across the whole economy and encourage young British entrepreneurs to develop ideas that rival the best in the world.”
The overall winner in 2017 was James Pearson from Lincolnshire, who came up with an app to provide information on coastal flood risks, went on to meet British ESA astronaut Tim Peake and is using his prize money to develop his idea.
James Pearson, 14, said: “The competition was absolutely amazing for me. It has opened my eyes to the opportunities that are around us. I have really had to push myself to learn new things. The highlights included meeting Tim Peake but also the industry experts. So far I have continued to get my website operational, I’ve been scanning the satellites for more images and I’ve increased my computing power. I will continue to work hard until the website is complete. I have really enjoyed this competition as it has developed my confidence, I was thrilled to win and just to learn about the space industry and technology.”
The competition, which aims to support the development of science, data handling and technological skills, is split into three age groups, with overall prizes of £7,500 for the best individual and best team. A further seven entries from across the age categories will win £5,000, making a total prize fund of £50,000. The judging panel will be made up of experts including representatives from the UK Space Agency, the European Space Agency, the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell and industry.
Adina Gillespie, Head of Applications for Earth Observation and Science, at Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), one of the expert judges, said: “The SatelLife competition is a great initiative to encourage young people to think about satellite applications and consider future careers in the space industry – and we have a lot of fun along the way.”
Entries can be as teams or individuals and all prize winners will be able to pitch their idea to a panel of ‘dragons’ from the space sector who will offer prizes. In 2017 the competition winners were offered a mix of support including an offer to build a prototype, thousands of pounds worth of space on Amazon Cloud Services, access to data, business development advice and a visit to a satellite factory.

Accounts Payable Automation: The solution finance departments can’t afford to ignore – Education Today,"['Infrastructure', 'News']","November 15, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/accounts-payable-automation-the-solution-finance-departments-cant-afford-to-ignore/,"For many education institutions, the accounts payable and finance departments face increasing workloads, along with pressures to get invoices processed quickly and efficiently. Although many areas of schools, colleges and universities are investing in digital processes to help increase efficiencies, many finance teams are still relying on traditional paper methods. This approach is no longer time or cost effective and can lead to errors, slow processing times and the need for space to store documents.
With the Government’s pledge to go paperless by 2020 there is still a lot of work to do. Recent research from AIIM shows that 42% of organisations still rely on paper for business functions and within that 34% report that their most important business content is referenced and filed as paper.
As 2020 approaches, education managers will face pressure to focus on eliminating paper processes across all areas where it’s no longer required and to invest in automated and digital services. Kefron, the information and document management specialist, can bring multiple benefits to finance teams with its Automated Accounts Payable (AP) service.
Kefron’s Automated AP solution is a cloud-based platform for the management of data and document processing and automated workflow that works alongside existing accounting software. With G-Cloud 9 status and ISO 27001 Information Security accreditation, Kefron’s cloud platform offers secure 24/7 processing and complete scalability.
The service works through data capture and scanning, allowing the information to be uploaded automatically and eliminating the need for manual input, saving staff time which can be used on other tasks. As a result, the invoice processing times, paper or digital, are decreased leading to cost savings. The AIIM research found that almost a third of those using automated solutions cited increased productivity as the biggest benefit it brought to them.
The automation process also improves accuracy as it decreases errors associated with human touch points. This streamlines the process and gives customer satisfaction and confidence that invoices are accurate.
The application provides complete and instant visibility to anyone authorised to view the documents. Anyone with access can immediately view the invoices and approve payments, increasing visibility, accountability and providing greater control of the AP process. The cloud based service also allows users to access documents remotely across devices including smartphones, laptops or tablets, allowing invoices to be approved or processed even when team members aren’t in the office.
The paperless system also saves on physical office space as there is no longer a need for paper invoices to be stored. The data capture and scanning system means that there are fewer duplicate invoices and fewer that are lost or misfiled.
Kristina Russell, UK Sales Manager, Kefron said: “Many areas of businesses are starting to go digital, however some functions, such as accounts payable, have fallen behind and continue to use more traditional methods such as manual input and processing. As a result, invoices can have errors, get lost or misfiled. Kefron’s service eliminates all of this whilst saving the team’s time and costs.
“Busy finance teams can’t afford to ignore how automation can bring multiple benefits to their day to day working, especially as Government pressure will increase over the next two years. Whilst initially some team members may be apprehensive to go digital once they see how much easier it makes their tasks and wish they had used the service earlier!”.

Delta Security helps Woodbridge High School achieve ‘lockdown’ – Education Today,"['Infrastructure', 'News', 'Security']","November 8, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/delta-security-helps-woodbridge-high-school-achieve-lockdown/,"Delta Security helps Woodbridge High School achieve ‘lockdown’
Delta Security, the CCTV and access control specialist, has helped Essex-based Woodbridge High School to further enhance the safety of its pupils and staff, with the installation of new swing gates that automatically close and restrict access in the event of a lockdown situation.
Lockdown, according to the National Counter Terror Security Office (NaCTSO), is a procedure designed to quickly restrict access and egress to a site or building (or part of) through physical measures in response to threat, either external or internal.
The lockdown system is designed so that the gates, situated at the school’s entrance, integrate with the existing access control and fob system. This enables school staff and visitors to access the site, but can be overridden and shutdown by authorised school personnel if site lockdown is required. Lockdown is activated through a button situated in the school’s reception, at which point an alarm is also raised.
Redbridge council has asked that all schools in the area put lockdown systems in place, and Woodbridge High School is one of the first in the area to have mobilised its system.
The gates are fitted with a CAME Stylo automation, which is ideal for pedestrian gates. It features a highly-robust 24V self-locking motor, that will stand up against intensive use.
Frank Gordon, School Business Manager At Woodbridge High School, says in today’s climate security in schools in paramount:
“No one enters the school without authorisation at the perimeter, and registration at reception. Each year we build further layers of security, and in today’s climate it is especially important to ensure our perimeter is as secure as possible,” he explains.
Delta Security has been working with Woodbridge High School for approximately ten years and so Frank approached the company to help mobilise a lockdown procedure:
“Delta Security is a supplier we know and trust to provide a first-class service,” he says. “Dave Mundy has extensive security knowledge and listens to our needs. He was therefore able to advise the best solution for us, and install within the school-holiday period to ensure minimal disruption. I would always recommend Delta Security to other schools.”
Dave Mundy, Operations Director at Delta Security, says lockdown procedures are becoming increasingly prevalent in schools: “We have seen increased interest from central London schools, especially around transport hubs such as St Pancras and Liverpool Street for a while now, and more recently in schools further out from the City centre. It is an area that I am particularly interested in, and give talks to schools on options and best practice.”

"‘Distance’ learning no substitute for ‘real’ interaction, CICM warns – Education Today","['Attainment', 'News']","November 8, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/distance-learning-no-substitute-for-real-interaction-cicm-warns/,"Learners studying in a real or virtual class are three-times more likely to gain CICM professional qualification than distance learners
Short-cuts in learning and development ultimately hold employees back, and there is no substitute for hard work and classroom interaction, according to the world’s largest professional body for the credit community.
New research from the Chartered Institute of Credit Management (CICM) suggest that while distance learning has its place, face-to-face education, in a real or virtual classroom, delivers three-times better results.
Debbie Tuckwood, CICM Head of Education and Professional Development, is concerned that while some learners may be happy with distance learning, they miss out on the interaction with their peers and teacher: “People generally learn better from each other,” she explains.
“Discussion between learners contextualises concepts and deepens knowledge and understanding. Learners are more likely to become emotionally invested in their learning and the level and intensity of their learning soars.’
Debbie points to recent CICM examination results in support of her view: “Learners studying for example at college or through a virtual class are three times more likely to pass CICM qualifications than learners who have studied by distance learning. Also, they are more likely to gain a good pass and progress their studies to the stage where they enter an exam or assignment for assessment.”
Debbie is not surprised by the results: “CICM qualification programmes are demanding and so investment in high quality tuition delivers a large return in terms of skills growth, confidence and progression. This is very different to a quick e-learning module or recorded webinar which you might access to improve a particular skill or keep up-to-date with a new regulation.”
She says that only a few, highly-motivated and self-sufficient learners seem to cope with long programmes of study by unsupported distance learning: “Companies persuaded to economise on qualification course fees should think about the return on investment,” she concludes.
New CICM Level 3 and Level 5 Diploma programmes start in January. To find out more about study options, go to the CICM website or email professionalqualifications@cicm.com.

ISM brings largest-scale thinking and innovation to its proven ISMS – Education Today,['News'],"October 27, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/ism-brings-largest-scale-thinking-and-innovation-to-its-proven-isms/,"Intergrated Security Manufacturing (ISM), a leader in the design, development and manufacture of ISMS technology, a technology that goes beyond PSIM, has launched an Enterprise version of its proven Genesys integrated security management system.
Already deployed within the National Critical Infrastructure sector, the new ISMS offers users unparalleled scale, redundancy and ease of use, and is leading the market as a proven solution.
As an enhancement of the existing Genesys2, the Enterprise version has been developed with the largest organisations in mind. Genesys is fully scalable to manage and control multiple sites from a single control room (or even a single workstation) across a country, or even across continents. It features the most advanced levels of encryption to ensure network security, and is accredited to the highest standards of government national infrastructure security.
Steve Smith, Managing Director of ISM, says that the extension of the Genesys range gives customers greater choice: “There have been a number of articles in the security press talking about PSIM companies starting to develop systems that go beyond the current solutions and moving to a federated architecture.
“With Genesys, however, we are already there. Genesys Enterprise resolves issues associated with the increasing geographical scope of clients, corporations, governments and institutions, while adhering to a multi-tiered hierarchy (or ‘federated’ system), where total control is centralised but allows individual sites to maintain local control.
“The new addition is ideally suited to those large organisations with multiple sites across multiple regions, who might also want to ‘flex’ to accommodate further sites and geographies as their needs evolve. As this comes from the Genesys stable, existing users only have to upgrade from their existing version to Enterprise without the expense of a complete technology refresh.”
Crucially, the new development allows the integration of multiple systems from multiple manufacturers – all from one holistic integrated security system. Every electronic security or fire safety device from CCTV and Intruder Alarms, to Electronic Locking and Public Address can be monitored and controlled from a single platform, regardless of who made them.
Most importantly, it includes the existing Migrating 3+ technology, a patented automatic failover technology that adds higher levels of automatic configurable redundancy and power. Control is effectively distributed across multiple workstations: “We take power to your PC and multiple it by the number of PCs on your network,” Steve continues.
“What this means is that if one PC fails, control is migrated to another PC seamlessly, with no interruption or downtime. Our system is therefore not restricted in its performance by the size or capability of a server, nor does it require the expense of moving to server farms or utilising clustering software.
“It means we deliver the most extreme redundancy characteristics for the threats you have thought of, and those that you haven’t!”
“The Enterprise development within the Existing Genesys is not a development waiting for a trial site, but rather has already been installed within a high-security Critical National Infrastructure project. It is tested and proven at the highest level under the most demanding conditions – and has been very successful.”
Genesys is a ‘true’ ISMS system built around intuitive software that combines a range of industry leading features and benefits including an enhanced graphical user experience, 3-D modeling and a comprehensive event management database. Events and alarms are presented to the operator clearly as and when they happen.
“Operators can be quickly trained to gain maximum advantage,” Steve continues. “The system also enables users to make better use of their staff and resources, since you don’t have to have all of your control rooms working 24-hours.”
“Genesys is a truly unique solution offering advanced system architecture, unparalleled ease of use for the operators and very low lifecycle costs.”
The ISMS software operates as a standalone platform over LAN or WAN networks for remote and local sites with workstations that can be transferred to any operating security control room on the network. This offers the end user flexibility when closing down sites or buildings for off-peak or out of normal working hours, or in the unlikely event of any system failures.

BAFTA LAUNCHES NEW CREATIVE CAREERS SHOWCASE AND ONLINE QUIZ – Education Today,"['Careers', 'Educational event', 'Industry Events', 'News']","October 25, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/bafta-launches-new-creative-careers-showcae-and-online-quiz/,"The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) is calling on teachers and careers advisers to sign up for its first ever careers event for educators, being held at its HQ at 195 Piccadilly, London, on Thursday 9th November.
With the creative industries worth over £84bn to the UK and growing at twice the rate of the rest of the economy (Dept for Digital, Culture, Media & Sports, gov.uk 201&), the event is designed to showcase the wide variety of opportunities available to young people in this thriving sector.
At the free event teachers will be invited to join panel discussions, workshops and breakout sessions covering subjects as diverse as talent spotting, career pathways, skills shortages, regional employment hubs and the realities of self-employment.
BAFTA award winning industry professionals will give first hand insights into how young people can get their talent noticed, the skills required to forge a successful career and training opportunities.
Teachers will also have the chance to try out BATA’s new online Careers Quiz, http://guru.bafta.org/careers-quiz, at the event.

The personality-based quiz takes young people through real life scenarios and based on their responses, suggests careers within the creative industries that fit with their natural aptitudes.
 
Each role is supported with a wealth of information on skills needed, routes into the career, as well as films from individuals already working in those roles, making the film an ideal classroom resource or content for careers and options evenings.
Tim Hunter, BAFTA’s Director of Learning and New Talent commented:  “We know that it can be challenging for teachers and careers advisers to give sound, up-to-date advice on getting into these industries as they’re evolving so fast.  New roles are emerging all the time and the routes into film, games and television can be less formal and structured than in other sectors.
“Through our new BAFTA Creative Careers Showcase and Careers Quiz we want to show educators and young people that if you find the right career fit, have the benefit of quality information and mentors, and know how to access training and networking opportunities, there’s a good chance of securing a job doing something you really love.”

Delta Security installs access control system at Gesher School – Education Today,"['News', 'Safety & Security']","October 17, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/delta-security-installs-access-control-system-at-gesher-school/,"Delta Security, the CCTV and access control specialist, is helping to ensure the safety of pupils and employees at the recently opened Gesher School with the installation of a sophisticated Salto access control and ID pass system.
Based in North London, Gesher School is an independent primary school that caters for Jewish children with special educational needs. It is entirely charitably funded, and currently has ten children who receive specialist care from two teachers, five teaching assistants and four therapists.
The Salto access control solution provides secure and convenient day-to-day access for authorised users, and enables school staff to print temporary ID passes for additional staff and visitors as required. The system’s easy-to-use software is capable of granting and restricting access to personnel according to their authorised area and duration of visit.
The school shares its site with another local authority children’s programme so it is especially important that it is able to restrict access and have a reliable system to ensure it knows who is on site at any time. Reports detailing who has visited the school, and for how long, are available at the touch of a button.
Gianna Colizza, Head Teacher of Gesher Primary School, says the installation went smoothly: “It was critical that the new system was in place in time for the school’s opening,” she says. “Delta Security was able to work around networking issues that arose from it being a new site, to ensure timely completion.
“The most important thing for us is to ensure we are doing everything we can to safeguard our children. Our new access control system furthers this goal, and I would recommend Delta Security to other schools.”",delta security the cctv and access control specialist is helping to ensure the safety of pupil and employee at the recently opened gesher school with the installation of a sophisticated salto access control and id pas system based in north london gesher school is an independent primary school that caters for jewish child with special educational need it is entirely charitably funded and currently ha ten child who receive specialist care from two teacher five teaching assistant and four therapist the salto access control solution provides secure and convenient daytoday access for authorised user and enables school staff to print temporary id pass for additional staff and visitor a required the system easytouse software is capable of granting and restricting access to personnel according to their authorised area and duration of visit the school share it site with another local authority childrens programme so it is especially important that it is able to restrict access and have a reliable system to ensure it know who is on site at any time report detailing who ha visited the school and for how long are available at the touch of a button gianna colizza head teacher of gesher primary school say the installation went smoothly it wa critical that the new system wa in place in time for the school opening she say delta security wa able to work around networking issue that arose from it being a new site to ensure timely completion the most important thing for u is to ensure we are doing everything we can to safeguard our child our new access control system furthers this goal and i would recommend delta security to other school,"['software', 'school', 'security', 'educational', 'jewish', 'cctv', 'daytoday', 'teaching', 'teacher', 'therapist']"
Into Film Festival 2017 now open for bookings – and it’s completely free! – Education Today,"['Cinema', 'Educational event', 'News']","September 7, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/into-film-festival-2017-now-open-for-bookings-and-its-completely-free/,"Bookings are now open for the Into Film Festival 2017 – the world’s biggest, free, youth film festival, which takes place from November 8th to 24th with 3,000 free screenings and events for 5-19 year-olds, many linked to subjects in the curriculum.   Open to schools, colleges, youth leaders and home educators the Festival uses the magic of film – from exclusive preview screenings of new blockbusters to popular classics – to engage young minds in a broad range of topics.
Building on the success of last year, which saw over 470,000 people attend, this year’s Festival seeks to actively involve 500,000 young people and educators from all backgrounds and corners of the UK in watching, reviewing and making films, some for the first time. With support from all the major UK cinema chains and venues ranging from the British Library, the V&A, the BFI Southbank and Pinewood Studios to a secret bunker in Scotland, a farm in Wales, and an Ark in Northern Ireland, the Festival provides access to the big screen at its best, including IMAX screens and the 3D and 4D experience. Over 130 films are confirmed to be screened in 600 venues across the UK – the Festival’s biggest reach yet.
The annual celebration of film and education is made possible by support from the BFI, Cinema First, a wide collaboration with UK cinema industry partners and delivery partners National Schools Partnership.
In a survey of teachers who attended last year, 94% of teachers said the Festival activities were useful in helping to deliver the curriculum, 94% of teachers felt the Festival activities were valuable in terms of the broader education of young people and 82% of teachers said that the Festival has made them more likely to use cinema visits to support the delivery of the curriculum.

"Children are less ready for school than five years ago, say school leaders – Education Today","['News', 'Primary schools', 'Research', 'Social issues', 'Unions', 'Wellbeing']","September 6, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/children-are-less-ready-for-school-than-five-years-ago-say-school-leaders/,"Eight out of ten school leaders report that many children arriving at primary school are not ready to take part in classroom activities. Of these, 86 per cent were concerned that children’s school readiness is worse than five years ago. The findings come from a new survey of school leaders published today by NAHT and the Family and Childcare Trust.
The most common reasons highlighted by school leaders for children not being school ready were:

Failure to identify and support additional needs early enough (67 per cent)
Parents having less available resources / pressure on parents and family life (66 per cent)
Reduction in local services to support families (63 per cent)
Reduction in local health services to support families (57 per cent)

Almost a quarter said that more than half their intake was not ready for school.
Almost 9 in 10 (88 per cent) said inadequate school funding was a barrier to improving school readiness.
School leaders highlighted particular concerns about communication skills and physical development. Speech, language and communication problems were the biggest issues with 97 per cent of respondents identifying these problems as a concern.
As the Chancellor and his team at the Treasury are making decisions about this autumn’s budget, NAHT and the Family and Childcare Trust are calling on the Government to prioritise funding for support for families in the early years to help set children up to learn at school and beyond.
Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary said: “We want to see extra money for education, including early education before children start school, and renewed investment in critical services for families. Without proper investment, the youngest and most vulnerable in our society will be starting off behind, with uncertain chances of catching up.”
Ellen Broomé, Chief Executive of the Family and Childcare Trust, said: “Four fifths of school leaders said that children who had no previous early education demonstrated the most challenging issues. There is strong evidence that early education can help to boost children’s outcomes and narrows the gap between disadvantaged children and their peers – but only if it is high quality. The Government must make sure that every child can access high quality early education and that parents can get the right support to help them to give their children the best start in life.”
Anne Lyons, NAHT President, and head teacher at St. John Fisher Catholic Primary School said: “With this report we are hoping to highlight the impact that cuts to public services are having on families and children. The support that families of all kinds regard as essential are being cut back or have already disappeared. Cuts to school budgets mean that it’s also getting harder to address these issues once the children are in school.”

Make the world better… with a Christmas sweater! – Education Today,"['Charity', 'Community engagement', 'Educational event', 'News']","September 5, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/make-the-world-better-with-a-christmas-sweater/,"Flashing, festive knits will be sweeping the nation once again this year as Save the Children’s annual fundraiser Christmas Jumper Day is taking place on Friday 15th December. Whether it’s at school, nursery or a youth group, Save the Children is calling on children across the UK to swap their uniforms, for their daftest, most wonderful woollies and raise money for children around the world.
From knits festooned in jingling bells to jumpers covered in lights, Save the Children is expecting over 5 million people across the UK to take part in the biggest, silliest Christmas Jumper Day ever. Simply by sticking on a fabulously festive knit, signing up and donating £1 to Save the Children at christmasjumperday.org, you will be helping to give the world’s forgotten children the chance to have a brighter future.
Schools can sign up at christmasjumperday.org and they will receive a free fundraising pack, full of handy tips on planning a great day. The more money raised, the more children Save the Children can help, which is why there are also plenty of ideas of ways to raise even more by organising things like:

Christmas bakes – hold a bake sale at school and get all the children involved, by creating some fun jumper-themed cupcakes and biscuits
Festive fancy dress teacher – teachers get sponsored to spend a day in full Christmas fancy dress, promising that, the more donations they receive, the more ridiculous they’ll look
Sweater singalong – organise a Christmas jumper sing-a-long where people battle it out to see if they really have the Christmas carol x-factor
Christmas Crafty Competition – kids pay an extra £1 to enter a crafty competition to see who can make the most original design
Jumper Hunt – Set up a jumper scavenger hunt where pupils follow curriculum based clues to collect jumper decorations and the final prize, a plain Christmas jumper. They then have 10 minutes to create the craziest Christmas sweater imaginable!

All money raised through this wacky woolly-wearing could help give a child living in a refugee camp  clothes to keep them warm through winter, help to buy nutritious food for their entire family, or set up a safe space to give children the chance to be children again. It could also help bring essentials like healthcare, education, protection and food to the millions of children around the world who are missing out on the most basic support.

The National Literacy Trust and Walker team up with Facebook to livestream Alex Rider school event – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'Literacy', 'News']","June 12, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-national-literacy-trust-and-walker-team-up-with-facebook-to-livestream-alex-rider-school-event/,"Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider books, is visiting a school in Greenwich to answer questions on his latest novel and inspire pupils across the country to enjoy reading through a live-streamed event in a collaborative event between Walker Books, the National Literacy Trust and Facebook.
Horowitz will be at the Thomas Tallis secondary school on 15 June to discuss the eleventh instalment in the Alex Rider series, Never Say Die, which was published this month by Walker Books. Other schools and fans of Anthony Horowitz can join the event and ask the author questions through a Facebook Live webcast, which will take place between 14.00 to 15.00 BST on 15 June via the Alex Rider Facebook page. Teachers can also access exclusive resources to support pupils’ literacy as they transition from primary to secondary school – a time when many students fall behind.
The event will be available to watch back afterwards in order to inspire students of both primary and secondary ages to enjoy reading. This comes in the light of new research from the National Literacy Trust which shows the dramatic fall in reading for enjoyment when children leave primary school.
The event will be chaired by author Steve Cole, who will be joined by an audience of year seven students, as well as year six pupils from local primary schools, many of whom will join the school in September.
Jonathan Douglas, Director of the National Literacy Trust said: “Although reading for enjoyment is at a record high among 8 to 11-year-olds, only 36% of boys between 14 and 16 like to read. This means that their reading age can be more than 3 years behind their peers that do enjoy reading. Working with Walker Books and Facebook we’re delighted to be bringing Anthony Horowitz Live to classrooms across the country. The event addresses this gap between primary and secondary school students and shows how fun reading can be.”
Author Anthony Horowitz said: “It’s great that more children are now reading for pleasure, but it’s important that this continues as they move from primary to secondary school. The Alex Rider books aim to capture the imagination of older pupils with action packed plots and topical themes. At my live event, I hope I’ll be able to inspire more students to pick up a book outside the classroom and get into reading.”
Jane Winterbotham, Publishing Director at Walker Books said: “We’re delighted to be working with the National Literacy Trust and Facebook on the welcome return of Alex Rider – Anthony has long been acknowledged as key force in getting reluctant readers excited about stories and we hope that by teaming up with Facebook we’ll engage many more potential readers both in schools and at home.”

St Albans School launches new website and new brand identity – Education Today,['News'],"June 2, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/st-albans-school-launches-new-website-and-new-brand-identity/,"St Albans School has launched a new website to provide better access to key information to parents and prospective parents, as well as delivering improved navigation and greater engagement across the news and events from the School.
The site (www.st-albans.herts.sch.uk), has been designed to make it even easier for prospective parents to access relevant entry point sections, giving targeted and tailored information.
Each of the sections – Lower School, Third Form, Middle School and Sixth Form – includes an introduction from the Head of School and a pupil video. The Information and About Us sections focus on the calibre of the teaching staff as well as the Pastoral Care and Co-curricular activities offered at the School.
A new What’s On tab includes the most recent news and events, from concerts to sports matches, as well as the School’s publications, Highlights and The Albanian. Social media feeds from the School’s Twitter (@SASHerts) and Facebook (facebook.com/stalbansschoolherts) also pull live content through from both pages.
There is also a comprehensive section for the School’s Foundation to support capital developments, the Bursary Fund and Special Projects, also has a section outlining the current ‘Building Futures’ project and plans for the future.
The new website, built by Cookham-based Pistachio Design, coincides with the recent rebranding of the School that has been designed to give it a more contemporary, elegant look for the future.
Based around the School’s motto ‘Born not for ourselves’, the crest has been stripped back and made more symmetrical to give it a cleaner, fresher look. The School’s Reflex Blue has been replaced with a darker blue, and the School’s primary yellow has been retained. The School’s fonts have also been updated.

‘Around the world in 10 days’ for Sustrans wheely big school challenge – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'Health, Hygiene & Safety', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Secondary schools', 'Sport & Play', 'Wellbeing']","January 11, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/around-the-world-in-10-days-for-sustrans-wheely-big-school-challenge/,"Schools across the country are being invited to sign up for The Big Pedal 2017 – a national challenge to get more young people cycling and scooting to school, backed by double Olympic gold medallist cyclist Joanna Rowsell Shand.
The Big Pedal 2017, which runs from Monday 20 to Friday 31 March, will see children, parents and teachers across the UK leave their cars at home and get on their bikes and scooters for their journeys to and from school.
Active travel does not just begin and end at the school gates, it can be incorporated into lively classroom activities.
This year’s theme ‘Around the world in 10 days’, links to key parts of the geography curriculum, as well as other subjects.
Participating primary and secondary schools will receive a pack of teaching resources, including a map of the world for pupils to track their progress.
Pupils can learn about the towns, cities, countries and continents they pass through via a series of cycling and scooting related facts provided as part of the resources pack.
Stops along the way include France, China, Antarctica, Netherlands, South Africa, Malawi, New Zealand, Columbia and the USA.
When passing through China, for example, pupils will learn that half of the one billion bicycles in the world are here.
During the 10 days, schools will compete with one another to make the most journeys by bike or scooter.
Children, parents and teachers will be able to log, track and compare their journeys online using The Big Pedal website.
The proportion of children walking and cycling to school has been declining since 1995, with the number being driven to primary school increasing each year – as many as one in four cars on the road during the morning peak are on the school run.
Children in the UK now lag far behind their peers in other nations for active travel. Only about 2-3% of UK children cycle to school compared to 49% of all Dutch primary school children.
Powered by national walking and cycling charity Sustrans and funded by the Bicycle Association on behalf of the cycle industry through its Bike Hub scheme, The Big Pedal has become the UK’s largest competition of its kind.
Last year more than 1,500 schools signed up to take part and teachers, parents, siblings and pupils made more than a million journeys (1,179,900) to school on their bikes and scooters.
In total, participants travelled more than three million miles – the equivalent to more than 123 trips around the world – as well as saving two million car journeys and more than 847 tonnes of C02.
The Big Pedal 2016 saved more than 2,500 gallons of fuel worth more than £12,000 and saw pupils, teachers and parents burn nearly 1.8million calories or a massive 7,000 donuts.
Joanna Rowsell Shand is supporting The Big Pedal for the second year running.
One of the best British cyclists of her generation, Joanna has won five world titles across individual and team events and gold medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.
She said: “Cycling is great for young people’s health, confidence and independence. The safer and more comfortable they feel on their bikes, the more they will enjoy cycling.
“The Big Pedal campaign is a fantastic way for kids to cycle together whilst learning about the rules of the road in a fun, engaging way. I hope this year as many schools as possible will take part in the UK’s largest school cycling and scooting event.”
Ben Merry, Behaviour Change Coordinator for Education at Sustrans, said: “The average primary school journey is just 1.6 miles – the perfect distance to walk or cycle.
“The Big Pedal is fun, inclusive and it helps schools to encourage whole families to lead more active lives, as well as reducing car traffic and pollution around the school gates.
“Although the competition runs for two weeks, it has a lasting effect on the way that the school community travel to school – last year 75% of schools that took part in the Big Pedal said pupils continued to cycle and scoot to school following the event.”
The Big Pedal 2017 is open to individual classes as well as whole schools, with hundreds of thousands of pupils expected to take part.
All schools will be entered into daily prize draws for rewards, including bike and BMX stunt shows and equipment if more than 15% of a school cycle or scoot on each day of the challenge.
For schools unable to take part in the main challenge there is also a one-day version, which can include cycling and scooting activities in the school day as well as on the journey to school.
To celebrate the finale of the challenge there is also the option to join Sustrans superhero fundraising day.

Oxford school to exhibit art at Christ Church Cathedral for Unity Week – Education Today,"['Art & Craft', 'KS2', 'News', 'Primary schools']","January 11, 2017",https://www.education-today.co.uk/oxford-school-to-exhibit-art-at-christ-church-cathedral-for-unity-week/,"Oxford-based day and boarding school Rye St Antony is preparing for a creative start to the new year with a huge art project in collaboration with Christ Church Cathedral. Work is already well under way for the Year 5 pupils under the direction of the school’s Head of Art and Design, Jenny White.
For the Week of Prayer for Unity (Wednesday 18 to Wednesday 25 January) and with the help and inspiration of the Oxford-based celebrated artist Nicholas Mynheer, young people from across the city have been invited to participate in an art project which depicts the need to care for creation. It is a way of acknowledging that much division and disunity in our world arises from consumption, greed and wastefulness in contemporary society.
A six-panel art installation (each panel measuring 2.2m x 1.2m) will explore the most basic of the earth’s resources featured in the creation story (light, water, land, air, shelter and sustainability) highlighting how human suffering can be alleviated and disunity between people and nations reconciled by addressing these most basic threats to our planet.
Rye St Antony’s contribution to the installation will follow the theme of “shelter”. The creation will sit within the six-panel installation and will be displayed at Christ Church Cathedral from 18 to 25 January. The panels will provide a focal point for the Service of Unity on the evening of Sunday 22 January. Children from the groups who have shared in the creation of the panels will also share in the leadership of the service by taking readings and prayers.
Commenting on the school’s contribution to the project, Rye St Antony’s Head of Art and Design Jenny White said, ‎”Each of these panels will seek to draw connections between the story of creation in Genesis and the contemporary challenge to overcome hostility and division by caring for the planet. Here at Rye, we are delighted to be taking on the theme of shelter. The children’s idea to develop a background of harmonious colours was an inspirational starting point, and they also discussed shelter in the form of trees. As the pupils’ ideas progressed, the tallest member of the class laid down on the canvas and her classmates drew around her and her outstretched arms which formed the foundation of our painting.
The other members of the class added their own arching arms and curved hands until it gradually turned into a tree shape, which became shelter for a pair of doves. The doves are in silhouette and the tree is energetic and vibrant. Our Year 5 pupils have thrown themselves into this project and we are absolutely thrilled to be involved. Through their involvement, the children have been thinking about conserving the natural habitat and sheltering the vulnerable, and have enjoyed the opportunity to reflect on their own experiences.”
St Andrew’s Primary School in Headington, St Margaret’s Church Art Group and St Barnabus Primary School are among the other groups taking on a panel each. Each group was free to choose whatever style they wished to create their panel, but the same white cloth background was provided to each to allow for consistency in the final production. The aim is to capture the beauty and interconnection of life on earth and to imagine, in the face of so many threats to life, how we can cooperate with each other to nurture, restore and reconcile the world.
Jenny White concluded, “Being asked to submit a group painting by Christ Church Cathedral is a wonderful opportunity, and we are delighted be involved in the Service of Unity on the evening of Sunday 22 January. We are also looking forward to finding somewhere big enough to display the painting at school when we get it back in February! The completed panels will be a culmination of lots of hard work by the six participating groups. The artwork expresses the pupils’ reflections, feelings and insights through shape, form and colour and it is a wonderful celebration of the children’s creativity and spirituality through the arts. I am sure that the size, colour and quality of the panels will transform the Cathedral and the overall effect will be striking.”

In the letter, national secretary Philippa Childs welcomes the government’s announcement of £50m a year for local authorities to continue to monitor and commission school improvement for low-performing maintained schools, and the new £140m strategic school improvement fund for academies and maintained schools.
Childs said: “Prospect is the largest union for school improvement professionals, so our members are keen for us to meet the DfE to flesh out more detail on its strategic proposals and how the new funding will be allocated.
“Members also want us to highlight the crucial role they play and encourage a discussion of key principles around mentoring and advising schools to produce successful outcomes for pupils across the whole ability range.”
She pointed out that while many of Prospect’s members in school improvement are still employed by local authorities, others operate as private consultants or work for private companies that sell their services to schools.
“However, in all cases, their independence from the schools they support is important to ensure objectivity.”
With the letter, Childs has enclosed Prospect’s standards for educational development and improvement professionals. This document identifies six key standards that recognise the responsibility of professionals working in children’s services for child development.

Character education and strong resilient learners top of the agenda – Education Today,"['News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'School Trips', 'Student engagement', 'Wellbeing']","December 8, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/character-education-and-strong-resilient-learners-top-of-the-agenda/,"Character education – important for building strong, resilient learners – is once again top of the agenda thanks to Inspiring Learning, winner of Best Residential Experience in this year’s School Travel Awards, who have announced plans to expand its network of award-winning Kingswood outdoor learning centres, designed to help develop these important life skills.  The move, made possible through significant new investment from Bridgepoint Development Capital (BDC), a London-based investor in small and medium sized growth companies, will put half of UK schools within a one-hour drive of the company’s popular facilities.  Set in areas of outstanding natural beauty and sites of special scientific interest, the centres offer exhilarating adventure activities in safe and secure environments.
A trusted provider of co-curricular and out of classroom learning to schools from the UK and overseas, Kingswood delivers residential learning experiences that focus on team building, problem solving and fun, helping young people to challenge themselves and bond with their peers and teachers, so that they are more engaged in the classroom and go on to achieve more at school and beyond.
In 2016 Kingswood worked with 190,500 people providing 1.2 million activities to 4,225 schools, youth and uniformed groups from across the UK and overseas.  It also provides the phase one residential component of the National Citizen Service, a programme open to all 16 and 17-year-olds in England designed to help build skills for work and life, while taking on new challenges and meeting new friends. To date Kingswood has helped 50,000 young people participate in the NCS programme.
Commenting on the Kingswood expansion, John Bentley, CEO, Inspiring Learning, said, “We are always looking for new ways to develop and innovate and are supported by an advisory group including experts from other educational institutions and industry bodies. Our purpose is to enhance the lives of young people through experiences that inspire.
“By partnering with teachers and group leaders, from planning through to review, we help to define and target their learning objectives to maximise the impact and value of their experience, develop self esteem, take personal responsibility, co-operate with and respect the needs of others.  We also help extend their personal horizons through greater appreciation and understanding of the world and the people around them; understand the need for sustainable relationships between people and their environment and enhance practical problem solving and team work skills.  This investment from Bridgepoint will enable Kingswood to extend its services to a significantly wider audience.”
Bridgepoint Development Capital (BDC)’s new investment will be used to:

Support and expand Inspiring Learning’s values and ethos;
Expand the range of educational activities available across all Kingswood centres;
Increase availability when customers want it most;
Expand the network of Kingswood centres so that half of UK schools are within a one-hour drive of a Kingswood centre;

BDC is part of Bridgepoint, one of Europe’s largest private equity investors which has invested in a range of companies in different sectors over the last 25 years including well-known names such as Cruise.co.uk, Fat Face and Prêt A Manger, Cambridge Education Group and Infinitas Learning, publisher of content and e-learning materials for primary and secondary schools and FE colleges across Europe.",character education important for building strong resilient learner is once again top of the agenda thanks to inspiring learning winner of best residential experience in this year school travel award who have announced plan to expand it network of awardwinning kingswood outdoor learning centre designed to help develop these important life skill the move made possible through significant new investment from bridgepoint development capital bdc a londonbased investor in small and medium sized growth company will put half of uk school within a onehour drive of the company popular facility set in area of outstanding natural beauty and site of special scientific interest the centre offer exhilarating adventure activity in safe and secure environment a trusted provider of cocurricular and out of classroom learning to school from the uk and overseas kingswood delivers residential learning experience that focus on team building problem solving and fun helping young people to challenge themselves and bond with their peer and teacher so that they are more engaged in the classroom and go on to achieve more at school and beyond in kingswood worked with people providing million activity to school youth and uniformed group from across the uk and overseas it also provides the phase one residential component of the national citizen service a programme open to all and yearolds in england designed to help build skill for work and life while taking on new challenge and meeting new friend to date kingswood ha helped young people participate in the nc programme commenting on the kingswood expansion john bentley ceo inspiring learning said we are always looking for new way to develop and innovate and are supported by an advisory group including expert from other educational institution and industry body our purpose is to enhance the life of young people through experience that inspire by partnering with teacher and group leader from planning through to review we help to define and target their learning objective to maximise the impact and value of their experience develop self esteem take personal responsibility cooperate with and respect the need of others we also help extend their personal horizon through greater appreciation and understanding of the world and the people around them understand the need for sustainable relationship between people and their environment and enhance practical problem solving and team work skill this investment from bridgepoint will enable kingswood to extend it service to a significantly wider audience bridgepoint development capital bdcs new investment will be used to support and expand inspiring learning value and ethos expand the range of educational activity available across all kingswood centre increase availability when customer want it most expand the network of kingswood centre so that half of uk school are within a onehour drive of a kingswood centre bdc is part of bridgepoint one of europe largest private equity investor which ha invested in a range of company in different sector over the last year including wellknown name such a fat face and prêt a manger cambridge education group and infinitas learning publisher of content and elearning material for primary and secondary school and fe college across europe,"['sustainable', 'education', 'winner', 'expert', 'inspiring', 'innovate', 'elearning', 'popular', 'exhilarating', 'awardwinning']"
New report finds social background has a negative impact on educational choices made by children at the age of 16 – Education Today,"['News', 'Policy', 'Research', 'Skills', 'Social issues']","December 5, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-report-finds-social-background-has-a-negative-impact-on-educational-choices-made-by-children-at-the-age-of-16/,"Bright children from poorer backgrounds are far less likely to go to university or study A-levels that could get them into top universities than their wealthier counterparts – even if they live in the same neighbourhood and achieve similar results at GCSE.
New research by the Social Mobility Commission has uncovered a progression gap between choices made by children on free school meals and their more affluent peers which cannot be explained by their results at school or where they live.
It found that just 24 per cent of children eligible for free school meals attend higher education compared to 42 per cent of children from more privileged backgrounds.
Poorer children are also twice as likely to drop out of education at 16 and are more than half as less likely to study A-levels that could get them into a top university.
The research, carried out for the Commission by Education Datalab, investigates the post 16 choices of children by social and geographical background, gender and ethnicity. The study explores all educational choices by all students who took GCSEs in the summer of 2010 by linking three national databases for the first time.
By taking into account factors such as where a child lives and their attainment at school, the research provides a unique analysis of how educational choices made at the age of 16 can have a deep impact on a child’s future career and earnings.
The report finds that GCSE attainment and geographical access to post 16 courses explains some of the gap in choices made by children from different backgrounds. But it also uncovers significant differences between poorer children and wealthier children living in the same neighbourhood with the same GCSEs results.
Overall, the research finds that around a quarter of the progression gap – the different choices made by children after leaving school – is purely down to social background.
Previous research has suggested that children from poorer backgrounds are less likely to have access to the knowledge and networks to help them make optimal education and career choices after leaving school.
In its recent State of the Nation report, the Social Mobility Commission called for more careers advice in schools, and better destinations data to hold schools to account for the guidance they give young people.
The report concluded that Britain has a deep social mobility problem which is getting worse for an entire generation of young people. It found that for every young person who gets into university from a treadmill or just managing family background, seven do not.
This new research also reveals stark geographical inequalities in the choices of institutions available to young people. It finds that there are 20 areas of the country with little, or no, school sixth form provision within a commutable distance. In these areas, there are significantly lower percentages of pupils studying academic qualifications at 16, attending a top university or studying for a science or maths degree compared to similar areas.
It also identifies the North East and the South West as having the fewest institutions for young people to choose from, which may be a significant factor in why post-16 and destinations outcomes are so poor in these regions. Whilst young people growing up on London have, on average, 12 post-16 institutions to choose from, those in the North East and the South West only have an average of seven colleges or sixth forms they could commute to.
Other key findings are:

White British students are far less likely to go to university than ethnic minority students: Indian (72 per cent), Pakistani/Bangladeshi (57 per cent), Black (72 per cent) and White British (36 per cent). Participation differences between White British and other ethnic groups who live in the same neighbourhood and with the same GCSE attainment are even more pronounced.
White British students are more likely to drop out of post 16 education than ethnic minority students: Indian (3 per cent), Pakistani/Bangladeshi (8 per cent), Black (7 per cent) and White British (10 per cent)
Female pupils are 8 per cent more likely to attend university than males (44 per cent versus 36 per cent). However, although female participation rates at top selective universities are slightly higher (10 per cent versus 9 per cent for boys), they are less likely to attend these universities than a boy from the same neighbourhood with the same GCSEs.

Alan Milburn, Chair of the Social Mobility Commission, said: “When low income youngsters from the same area with the same school results are progressing less than their better-off classmates, that is not about lack of ability. It is about lack of opportunity. The progression gap has many causes but it suggests something is going badly wrong in our education system.
“The lack of proper careers advice in schools and the sheer complexity of the post-16 education and training system make it particularly difficult for lower income youngsters to translate their attainment at school into qualifications that are well rewarded in the labour market.
“That has significant consequences for social mobility and leads to many young people becoming trapped in low skilled, low paid jobs. Government and schools should be working to create more of a level playing field of opportunity for youngsters to progress.”
Dr Rebecca Allen, Director of Education Datalab, said: “The age of 16 marks the first point in most individual’s educational lives where opportunities and choice can become markedly diverse.
“Our research reminds policy makers that they should pay attention both to geographical disparities in access to high quality post-16 provision and to understanding the reasons why students with identical opportunities make very different choices.”",bright child from poorer background are far le likely to go to university or study alevels that could get them into top university than their

The idea of helping to get the right people into schools that need them the most was promising. I think we have learned now that we cannot rely on schemes that only transfer people from one part of the country to another. We must help local areas develop, support and retain their own staff.
“One reason the scheme has not delivered is that there are simply not enough teachers in the system. We have to get the basics right – proper starting pay and good working conditions.
“Yesterday’s annual report from Ofsted made this clear, and our own recruitment  survey released in November confirms that schools are struggling to recruit. This is felt by all types of schools across all regions.”
James Bowen, director of middle leaders’ union NAHT Edge, says: “Whilst we are pleased that the government are finally taking steps to address the obvious problems with recruitment and retention, we need them to move beyond just tinkering at the edges with such schemes.

Primary schools in Northern Ireland continue to rank among the best in the world in maths – Education Today,"['KS2', 'News', 'Research']","November 29, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/primary-schools-in-northern-ireland-continue-to-rank-among-the-best-in-the-world-in-maths/,"A major international survey of pupil achievement in mathematics and science shows that pupils aged 9 -10 in Northern Ireland continue to perform very well in maths.
The National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) carried out the research for the Department of Education. Achievement in science was found to be not as high, but is still above the international average.
Data from the 2015 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) reveal that only five of the 50 countries taking part in the mathematics assessments outperformed Northern Ireland.
Education Minister Peter Weir said: “The report shows that primary schools here have maintained a strong performance in the subject as demonstrated in the previous TIMSS study in 2011.
“It also highlights that primary schools in Northern Ireland have highly qualified principals and teachers who are committed to continued professional development. The level of participation in professional development activities for mathematics was higher in Northern Ireland than that seen internationally.”
Continuing, the Minister said the findings reflect those of the Chief Inspector’s report (2014 -16) published on 16 November 2016 which found that in 89% of primary schools inspected, achievements and standards in mathematics and numeracy were good or better.
The Minister said he was very encouraged by the findings of this study which show local children have a positive attitude towards educational achievement both at home and school.
He said: “The vast majority of children have parents with a positive attitude towards mathematics and science.
“In addition, our principals and teachers were reported to have some of the highest levels of emphasis on academic success. A positive attitude towards learning is also fostered by our pupils with the majority reporting that they enjoy learning maths and science.”
Most children in Northern Ireland attend schools with an environment that is conducive to learning, according to the study. Schools which have few disciplinary problems are safe and orderly places of learning where pupils report relatively low levels of bullying. These positive aspects of the school learning environment have remained unchanged since the 2011 TIMSS study.
Carole Willis, Chief Executive of NFER, commented: “TIMSS provides a valuable way for nations to benchmark the performance of their education systems, and Northern Ireland has continued to perform well in this latest round.  NFER has been involved in running TIMSS since it first began in 1995, and brings a unique combination of expertise in education systems and robust research.  The insights we provide through TIMSS on students, their teachers and schools will help policymakers and schools in Northern Ireland to build on their strengths and address areas where its performance could be improved further.”

Simon Pile, Into Film Teacher of the Year 2016 said:
“I’m thrilled to have won this award. Film is giving the children at Anson aspiration, showing them what is possible and getting them to see life beyond Cricklewood.  Film, as a tool to support the curriculum and inspire children, is one of the reasons the children are in the top 5% of schools in the country for progress in reading and achieving close to the national averages in writing year after year.
Into Film is enabling us to give real power to children, to enable them to experience not just the idea of becoming a film actor, or director; but really thinking what goes on behind the film, or what goes into a film, so that they can use their skill set creatively to better themselves.”
Barbara Broccoli OBE (BOND), Into Film Board Member, said:
“Creating films takes real passion, commitment and drive and I’m delighted the Into Film Awards acknowledge the hard work that these young people, the next generation of filmmakers, have put in over this last year.  Apart from being great fun, this day also offers nominees the chance to see their films on one of the biggest screens in the UK, the Odeon Leicester Square, as well as meeting established actors, directors and producers. It’s also our chance to thank the teachers who run our film clubs and use film in the classroom. Into Film places film at the heart of learning, reaching a million young people each year through clubs, online content, filmmaking and training to support classroom teaching.”
Into Film, an education organisation supported by the BFI through Lottery funding, aims to put film at the heart of young people’s education, contributing to their cultural, creative, academic and personal development.  Working with the education sector, film industry and arts and cultural organisations, Into Film is available to every school, college and youth group across the UK and gives children and young people the chance to experience film creatively and critically, as well as learn about the film industry and careers within it.  Training, CPD and resources are provided to give teachers and youth leaders the tools to support engagement at all levels and promote the use of film as a powerful education resource.

3 out of 5 parents say cyberbullying is now harder for them to deal with than face to face bullying – Education Today,"['Bullying', 'News', 'Online safety', 'Social issues', 'Wellbeing']","November 14, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/3-out-of-5-parents-say-cyberbullying-is-now-harder-for-them-to-deal-with-than-face-to-face-bullying/,"A new study for Anti-Bullying Week by not-for-profit organisation Internet Matters,  has found that parents were significantly more likely to be concerned about children aged 13 and under compared to those 14 and above.
With smartphone use amongst children now increasingly common, cyberbullying ranks alongside online grooming and sexting in the hierarchy of risk for parents.
62% of parents were concerned about the prospect of cyberbullying – overshadowing the amount of anxiety caused by online grooming (56%) and sexting (59%).
Almost one in 10 (9%) parents said their child has been involved in a cyberbullying incident.
Yet despite widespread concern about the topic, 32% of parents questioned by Internet Matters admitted they had yet to talk to their children about it.
The research comes ahead of this year’s Anti-Bullying Week (14-18 November), with co-ordinated events in schools and communities across the country to encourage children, teachers and parents to take positive action against bullying.
The theme this year is ‘Power For Good’ – a message of empowerment for children and young people, parents and teachers to take collective action to stop bullying in all its forms.
Organisers the Anti-Bullying Alliance are set to announce the winners of the first ever Power for Good Award, with one recipient each from a primary and secondary school. Children and young people have been nominating teachers and school staff from across England who have gone the extra mile to provide pastoral care to students suffering from issues like bullying.
Lauren Seager-Smith, National Coordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said: “We were overwhelmed by how many entries we received, over 100 students or classes got in contact to tell us about an inspirational teacher. We want there to be an acknowledgment that bullying can happen anywhere, and for all school staff to be trained and supported to work with pupils and parents to tackle the issue.”
The Anti-Bullying Alliance is also running a social media campaign to display a ‘Twibbon’, as well as award digital rosettes to those who are playing an effective part in tackling bullying.
Vic Goddard, Headteacher of Passmores Academy in Harlow, Essex, said: “Parents need to be more aware of how bullying has changed due to technology. I remember my mum saying to me, when I’d been the victim of some bullying, ‘come home because you are always safe here’. Sadly that is no longer true.
“Kids spend less than twenty per cent of their childhood in school, so home is where they need most protection. We run evenings where we give advice to parents about how to do this, but often they’re not very well attended.
“So it’s frustrating when a parent of an eleven-year-old tells us they have no idea what social media their child is using, or who they’re interacting with in their bedroom on their smartphone. Schools and parents must work together. “
Carolyn Bunting, General Manager of Internet Matters, said: “Child safety online is one of the top concerns for parents, yet our research shows a third of parents admit they’ve never had a family discussion about cyberbullying.
“This is understandable. Children often don’t want to talk about it and can end up suffering in silence. Educating ourselves and our families will help us all embrace the positive aspects of the internet while making children less vulnerable.”

A hidden industry – Education Today,"['Apprenticeships', 'Engineering', 'News', 'Skills']","November 9, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/a-hidden-industry/,"It is no exaggeration to say that modern life would not be possible without air conditioning and refrigeration. The technology is often hidden, tucked away behind the scenes or on roof-tops. In fact, it is often at its best when it is invisible, just getting on with the job. But it is nonetheless essential.
Many of the manufacturing processes today require a refrigeration or cooling process; air conditioning and refrigeration systems also provide comfortable living and working environments. How would we cope without the domestic refrigerator; or air conditioning at work on a sweltering summer’s day?
Despite it being a huge and growing industry, we are currently facing a real skills shortage in refrigeration and air conditioning, which insiders predict will only get worse unless schools, government and businesses work harder to combat the issue with information, support and investment. This is an industry that will continue to grow, but its skill and knowledge base must be replenished; with young people made more aware of the opportunities to use these skills worldwide.
SkillFRIDGE, the national refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump competition, sponsored by Toshiba, forms part of the WorldSkills UK portfolio, a government led initiative designed to champion world-class apprenticeships and technical skills development programmes. Following a round of regional heats in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the national final is now poised to take place at next week’s Skills Show (17-19 November, NEC Birmingham).
Explaining the thinking behind it, competition organising partner manager Karena Cooper says: “This competition aims to show young people just how relevant this industry is to everyday life. It also aims to show just how exciting a career in any of these sectors can be, through industry events and media awareness.
“Our goals are to promote the demand for apprenticeships and training; to provide a platform for the refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump industries to engage with young people and to raise standards at national level”.
“Engineers and designers in this industry require a very broad range of skills”, says David Dunn director and general manager of Toshiba Air Conditioning and CIAT Ozonair. “The technology touches on many disciplines – refrigeration, electrics, electronics, mechanical engineering, plumbing, fluid dynamics, IT, to name a few.
“All of these require a grasp of the underlying theory plus practical hands-on application skills. This can be quite challenging, but also very interesting and motivating for those people with the right mind and skill-set.”
It’s a huge industry, the potential for which is simply not understood says project manager Mark Forsyth: “Students are not aware of the RAC career path opportunities at an early stage and many employers are reluctant to invest the time and effort in training. Apprenticeships should be part of a business growth strategy. We need more female RAC engineers too. “
David continues: “The area of connectivity and intelligent control is transforming the acr industry, and opening up a new chapter that has much more appeal to tech-savvy young people. It is one of the areas of greatest innovation for my own company in recent years.
“Once young people get a sense of this new frontier opening up, and the impact and influence it has on people’s lives, they get very excited about the possibilities – and training and career opportunities it offers.
“Other key issues are energy and the environment, big concerns of young people, and headline issues for both our industry and society at large.
“We are holding open days at The Skills Show for students to come and see what we do. Toshiba sponsors the training and skills zone, as we believe this is vital area for the future.
“We need to project an upbeat and forward-looking vision so that we attract the new generation of engineers and designers we need for the future. The rewards can be very significant and there are huge opportunities for bright, talented people.”

SAS and RM Unify partner to close digital skills gap in schools – Education Today,"['Digital skills', 'News', 'Skills', 'Support materials']","October 31, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/sas-and-rm-unify-partner-to-close-digital-skills-gap-in-schools/,"The UK is facing a much heralded digital skills crisis with the Science and Technology Committee recently warning the country risks being left behind other nations, unless more action is taken to address the problem.  To kick-start uptake of subjects that nurture these skills, analytics leader SAS has partnered with leading education technology provider RM Unify, to deliver a wide range of free, high-quality online resources.
The big data workforce is expected to grow by around 346,000 according to SAS’ research with The Tech Partnership, with demand for these jobs rising by 160 per cent from 2013 to 2020. This workforce will be a vital part of the UK economy, as big data analytics and internet of things (IoT) are expected to deliver combined revenues of £322 billion from 2015 to 2020 according to a study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr).
SAS and RM Unify’s partnership gives students the building blocks to prepare them for the digital workplace of the future.  Thousands of interactive online resources covering multiple subjects on the national curriculum, including Mathematics, English and Science, are available via SAS Curriculum Pathways. These will now be available through RM Unify, which allows students and teachers to easily access all their online resources via a single platform.
“The next generation requires a solid foundation in digital skills – especially in areas like analytics, business intelligence and data management. Providing support, training and foundational knowledge for young people in schools, colleges and universities is a key piece of the puzzle,” said Geoffrey Taylor, Head of Academic Programmes at SAS UK & Ireland.
“With the SAS Curriculum Pathways programme having achieved great success across the US, we are delighted to provide UK schools with the platform mapped to the English, Scottish and Welsh curriculums for all age groups. With official endorsement from educational bodies, English schools have the reassurance that SAS Curriculum Pathways is an excellent tool for its teachers and students alike. Our partnership with RM Unify will ensure wider accessibility of the platform as we continue to support digital skills across England’s schools.”
Through the partnership, SAS Curriculum Pathways is now available to approximately 2,000 schools across England through RM Unify. The interactive online resources create learning environments that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the classroom setting. Students use the digital resources independently to supplement teacher-led activities, resulting in meaningful learning experiences that foster a deep, robust understanding of concepts.
“We are delighted to be working with SAS to broaden the wide range of online resources we provide to English schools,” said Ben Mallard, Product Manager at RM Unify. “SAS Curriculum Pathways is the only offering of its kind in the marketplace. At zero cost, the high quality of its content, such as virtual science labs where experiments can be conducted, is unmatched. It covers the key foundations needed by today’s students to build digital-savvy careers and ensure they don’t get left behind in the global marketplace.”

Education charity’s YouTube channel shows benefits of outdoor learning – Education Today,"['News', 'Outdoor learning / sport', 'Primary schools', 'School Trips']","October 28, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/education-charitys-youtube-channel-shows-benefits-of-outdoor-learning/,"A Kent environmental education centre has set up its own YouTube channel so parents can see for themselves how outdoor learning helps children gain a sense of their own individual interests, strengths and abilities.
Rippledown, in Ringwould near Deal, works with schools from across the UK and Europe to show children how connecting with nature can be inspiring and fun.
The first video to be posted shows children from Macaulay Primary School in Clapham, London, learning about marine life during their residential visit. The class took their nets and buckets to nearby St Margaret’s Bay for a rock pooling session in which they found green crabs, sea snails, shrimps and even a blenny fish.
This film captures the children’s experience in their own words, giving them a useful record of their day, which they can use in their follow-up activities in the classroom. The video also gives parents a deeper understanding of their child’s unique outdoor learning experience.
Watch the video:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIcT70vmh8rcGpenuq9eU1g
Rippledown Outdoor Learning Centre, run by The Bay Trust, one of the UK’s leading environmental education charities, hosts the visits for the Learning Away #BrilliantResidentials campaign.
More films are planned for the YouTube channel, showing viewers the many ways in which outdoor activities can teach children about teamwork, orienteering, horticulture and sustainable living.
Rippledown has welcomed more than 40,000 school children since it opened in 1977, providing each of them with a unique education at the old rectory house. For some, this is their first experience of being away from home.
Rippledown’s residential education programmes attract schools from across London and the South East, including East Anglia, and also France and Belgium.

LGA responds to Education for All bill – Education Today,['News'],"October 27, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/lga-responds-to-education-for-all-bill/,"Responding to the Government statement that the Education for All Bill, announced in the Queen’s Speech, will not be introduced in Parliament, Cllr Richard Watts, Chair of the Local Government Association’s Children and Young People Board, said:
“We are pleased that the Secretary of State is acting on the strong concerns from councils about the Government’s planned education reforms. Today’s announcement is the right decision and shows the Government has been listening to our concerns, which have been echoed by MPs, teachers and parents.
“Councils have been clear from the outset that the proposals within the Bill focussed too heavily on structures, when our shared ambition is on improving education for all children. In particular, both the forced academisation of schools in areas considered to be ‘unviable’, and the removal of the council role in school improvement, went against evidence that council-maintained schools perform more highly than academies and free schools in Ofsted inspections, and that conversion to academies did not in itself lead to better results.
“In our submission to the Treasury ahead of the Autumn Statement, we have called on the Government to take advantage of councils’ unique position in the community and give them a clear and strategic role in overseeing local schools systems, accompanied by appropriate resources, powers and flexibilities, so that they can support local school improvement and hold schools to account for education standards.
“We also urge government to reverse plans to cut £600 million from the Education Services Grant awarded to councils and academies next year.
“This funding is vital to help ensure that children are getting the education they deserve, from helping to provide speech therapy and physiotherapy, to carrying out DBS checks on staff and providing music services in schools. It also helps to plan for the new school places that are urgently needed, ensuring that every child has a place at a good school near their home.
“The LGA remains keen to work with the Department for Education to ensure that all partners are working together to deliver the excellent education that ensure every child gets the very best from their years at school.”",responding to the government statement that the education for all bill announced in the queen speech will not be introduced in parliament cllr richard watt chair of the local government association child and young people board said we are pleased that the secretary of state is acting on the strong concern from council about the government planned education reform today announcement is the right decision and show the government ha been listening to our concern which have been echoed by mp teacher and parent council have been clear from the outset that the proposal within the bill focussed too heavily on structure when our shared ambition is on improving education for all child in particular both the forced academisation of school in area considered to be unviable and the removal of the council role in school improvement went against evidence that councilmaintained school perform more highly than academy and free school in ofsted inspection and that conversion to academy did not in itself lead to better result in our submission to the treasury ahead of the autumn statement we have called on the government to take advantage of council unique position in the community and give them a clear and strategic role in overseeing local school system accompanied by appropriate resource power and flexibility so that they can support local school improvement and hold school to account for education standard we also urge government to reverse plan to cut million from the education service grant awarded to council and academy next year this funding is vital to help ensure that child are getting the education they deserve from helping to provide speech therapy and physiotherapy to carrying out db check on staff and providing music service in school it also help to plan for the new school place that are urgently needed ensuring that every child ha a place at a good school near their home the lga remains keen to work with the department for education to ensure that all partner are working together to deliver the excellent education that ensure every child get the very best from their year at school,"['secretary', 'queen', 'ofsted', 'reform', 'parent', 'education', 'parliament', 'teacher', 'therapy', 'councilmaintained']"
MAKE YOUR BUILDING SUPER-EFFICIENT WITH A POWER DEC – Education Today,['News'],"October 5, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/make-your-building-super-efficient-with-a-power-dec/,"Public authorities like schools, galleries and leisure centres have to display a DEC. Did you know you can also use it as a powerful tool for improving energy efficiency?
Failure to show a valid DEC could result in a £1,500 penalty. Enquire now for a free and receive a free no obligation DEC checking service.
 
Getting efficiency right and effective
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Business visionary Peter Drucker said: “Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things,” and you achieve both with a Display Energy Certificate (DEC).
Under European Directives 2002/91/EC and 2010/31/EU, you must display a DEC at any public building or one that’s frequently visited by the public in England and Wales, when it has a total useful floor area of 250m2 or more. By law, you must also have an advisory report.
It’s advantageous having both. First, your local authority can charge a penalty of £500 for not displaying the DEC and £1,000 for failing to have a valid report. Second, if you take on board the report’s recommendations you can improve your building’s energy performance.
 
It’s a must to show your ratings 
_______________________________________________________________________
Display Energy Certificate regulations apply wherever your building is located in England and the UK. It could be a museum in London, a library in Manchester, universities and colleges in Birmingham, or a sports and social centre in Leeds.
Any building that’s frequently visited by the public must, under Environmental Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) legislation, of which DEC is part, show its energy performance.
The DEC will display your operational ratings for the building from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). This is based on actual energy consumption over the last 12 months
Where the building has a total useful floor area of more than 1,000m2, the DEC is valid for 12 months. The accompanying advisory report is valid for seven years. For buildings with a total useful floor area of between 250m2 and 1,000m2, the DEC and advisory report are valid for 10 years.
 
More to DEC than meets the eye
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
As well as displaying your energy usage, the DEC requirements also help you keep tabs on your energy without superhuman effort.
Your DEC, and the advisory report that goes with it, has to be produced by an accredited energy assessor. There’s a whole team at Utilitywise, the UK’s largest energy consultancy, who can help you supercharge your savings.
The report will recommend improvements to your building that are designed to drive up its energy efficiency, reduce your fuel bills, cut carbon emissions and improve the public’s perception of it.
Since non-domestic buildings are responsible for about 20 per cent of total UK CO2 emissions, according to leading authority on the built environment BRE, it’s good PR to be seen to be doing something to improve that statistic.
 
Any other questions?
 
Chris Toole from Utilitywise said: “People often ask our energy assessors whether a DEC is required if you are a public authority and rent the building you own to a private company that’s not a public service.
“Our answer is no. It’s up to the occupier to provide a DEC and if they’re a private firm they don’t have to display one anyway.”
You may also be wondering if you need an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). They’re similar to a DEC and all domestic and commercial buildings in the UK, bought or rented, must have one as part of the EPBD.
An EPC is required to inform potential buyers or tenants about the energy efficient nature of your building and is valid for 10 years from date of issue. An EPC states an energy rating from A to G and is based on the performance potential of the building and its services. Before a DEC assessment can be carried out on a new build property, an EPC must be available for it.

Parents call for teachers to rethink the traditional primary school report – Education Today,"['KS1', 'KS2', 'News', 'Parental engagement', 'Primary schools', 'School Improvements', 'Software Management Systems']","September 22, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/parents-call-for-teachers-to-rethink-the-traditional-primary-school-report/,"Research from Capita SIMS has revealed that over half of parents (57%) feel primary school reports are either too generic or do not contain enough information about how their child is doing.
More than a third of primary school teachers (35%) agree. This is despite the fact that schools are now recording more information about the children they teach than ever before.
The results suggest that primary schools’ communication with parents needs to evolve, something some heads are actively addressing.
Jayne Mullane, headteacher at Mersey Vale Primary School in Stockport, remarks: “We need to listen to parents to find out what information they want to receive. In my school, parents gave us feedback on our reports and we changed them as a result. They now include information about how much effort a child makes in class as well as details of academic performance.”
The Capita SIMS survey found that knowing whether their child is happy and confident in class tops the list of information parents want to know from teachers, suggesting that mums and dads do not just want academic results on their reports.
And although three-quarters of parents (74%) stated that it was very important to have information on happiness and confidence, less than half (46%) reported actually receiving it from their child’s primary school.
Teachers too felt information on a child’s happiness was crucial, with 75% stating it was very important for parents to have this information.
Phil Neal, a director at Capita SIMS, comments: “The vast majority of parents believe teachers are doing a great job, but the research does indicate that information about how a child is doing in school needs updating.
“By asking parents what they want, schools can actually stop collecting unnecessary data and just focus on the information that really helps teachers in class and gives parents a more rounded picture of their child’s progress.
The survey also revealed that most teachers (85%) agreed that technology has a positive impact on their workload when it comes to monitoring pupil progress.
Phil Neal continues: “By making better use of the management information systems and pupil tracking software that they already have in primary schools, teachers can track a richer set of information about pupils without impacting on workload.
“Teachers could just as easily record and report on whether a child helped a friend in class or is working hard on a particular project – details that are often just as important to parents as assessment results.”

Primary school children can become ‘Hand Washing Champions’ in celebration of Global Handwashing Day on October 15th – Education Today,"['Competition', 'News']","August 25, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/primary-school-children-can-become-hand-washing-champions-in-celebration-of-global-handwashing-day-on-october-15th/,"Each year on October 15th, over 200 million people in over 100 countries take part in celebrations to mark Global Handwashing Day. Once again, Deb is heavily involved in this day of advocacy, which promotes handwashing with soap as an easy, effective, and affordable way to prevent diseases and save lives.
First held in 2008, Global Handwashing Day is designed to support a global and local handwashing culture, shine a spotlight on the state of handwashing around the world, and raise awareness about the benefits of the practice. The day is endorsed by a wide array of governments, international institutions, civil society organisations, NGOs, private companies, and individuals.
This year’s theme – ‘Make Handwashing a Habit!’ – highlights the importance of handwashing as a ritual behaviour. To be effective, hand hygiene needs to occur regularly at key times, such as after using the toilet or before contact with food.
Deb is encouraging primary schools in the UK to inspire their students to become ‘Hand Washing Champions’, with activities and lessons aimed at making the hand washing procedure at school fun, engaging, and memorable.
Throughout September, Deb there will be running a national ‘Hand Puppet Competition’. Students will be encouraged to design their own ‘Hand Washing Champions’ and enter their creations into a competition. The winning student design will be announced on October 31st and will receive a £100 book voucher. Furthermore the winning hand puppet design will be reproduced on a bespoke dispenser, which Deb will supply to the school free of charge across all their washrooms.
Deb is also encouraging schools to run a hand washing community day. On October 13th, Deb is organising a ‘Community Day’ with a local school – St. John’s Primary School in Belper, Derbyshire – where children can learn first-hand about the importance of hand hygiene from a Deb representative.
“Global Handwashing Day is a fantastic opportunity for people around the world to come together in celebration and support of better hand hygiene,” said Paul Jakeway, Marketing Director at Deb.
“We are thrilled to be working with schools in the UK, and support their efforts to make handwashing a daily routine for their students. Encouraging children from an early age and getting them into the habit of washing their hands as part of their school day will help ensure that this practise becomes part of their lifelong routine.”
Effective hand hygiene is universally recognised as the smartest means of infection control in educational environments. Yet, a survey by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine unearthed that only 63.8% of primary school pupils regularly washed their hands with soap at school, a figure which dropped to 39% for secondary school pupils.
Lack of education about handwashing with soap could be contributing to the spread of diseases in schools. Inadequate hand washing could also impact absenteeism, with illness constituting almost 60% of all absences across schools in England. Annually, nearly 22 million school days are lost each year due to the common cold.
Deb is working towards catalysing habit formation and behaviour change in schools with a range of brightly coloured and attractive soap dispensers, which are designed to help engage children in the hand washing process. Dispensing systems are more hygienic, economical and environmentally-friendly than bar soap or bulk fill systems, and easy to operate for children.
In addition to dispensers and a comprehensive range of skin care products, Deb also provides schools with a range of training and educational materials to ensure hand hygiene compliance is adhered to in educational institutions around the country.

Why your small business needs branding and how to build it – Education Today,['News'],"August 4, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/why-your-small-business-needs-branding-and-how-to-build-it/,"If you’re a startup or a relatively small business, then it’s understandable if you don’t yet place a high value on the importance of branding for your future. But branding isn’t just a huge buzzword reserved only for the like of giant corporations. It is just as essential for SMEs.
No matter what stage of growth your business is at, it’s important to perfect your branding from top to bottom, but knowing where to start can be tricky.
To help you out Phil Foster, Managing Director of Love Energy Savings has shared his thoughts on why branding is important and some things to consider as you move forward.
What is branding?
In a nutshell, branding is a business’ way of identifying who they are and what they do. It represents your values and the true core of who your business is.
Having a strong brand also helps you to build a good reputation. Whether you are starting out and have no reputation at all, or are looking to improve the profile you already have, a successful brand can help. It’s all about building expectations about your services or products, which in turn can encourage your staff to exceed them as they are motivated to live up to the name you have nurtured.
Why is small business branding important?
The most successful companies keep branding at the very heart of everything they do. It is a way of defining your business’ identity; understanding exactly what your business is about, what it looks like, sounds like and how it appears to your customers. Not only will it keep your customers coming back for more, but it will also ensure that your employees feel more at home and loyal.
Here’s a few more reasons why branding is important for your small business…
Recognition – When you see some of the most famous logos in the world, you instantly know the name of the company, what they do, and what they stand for. Whilst you may not achieve that status straight away, by having a strong brand you will start to build a reputation that people will recognise you for.

Trust – Speaking of reputation, appearing professional and consistent in your branding improves your credibility amongst customers.
Being found – If you sell offline as well as online, having a well-established brand helps potential customers to find you wherever they may go.

Logos are a good place to start. Your logo must represent you; tell people who you are, show the type of company you are, and communicate your values clearly all in one. It’s a tough balancing act to perfect, but it can be done.
Here are a few things to keep in mind…

Name and tagline – We may be stating the obvious, but make sure the name and slogan are clearly visible. That way your customers will remember your name and it becomes far easier for them to talk about you to other people.
What do you do? – Does your logo represent the services or products you provide? Your potential customers should be able to know they are in the right place at a single glance.
Show your personality – Maya Angelou once said “At the end of the day, people won’t remember what you said or did, they will remember how you made them feel.” How do you want your customers to feel when they see your logo? Home in on one particular emotion to avoid confusion, whether it’s fun, approachable or emphasising the fact that you’re experts in your field, otherwise you may be forgettable.

Finding your brand’s voice
Some of the biggest and most well-known and liked brands out there all have one thing in common: they have a very distinct voice. For example, a luxury watch brand like Rolex is known for being classy and upmarket. Red Bull is daring, adrenaline-spiking and exciting. On the other hand, one brand who does social media particularly well, is Innocent; their Twitter is fun, cheeky and they write the way they speak.
A perfect branding isn’t something that you can achieve overnight, but it is something that you should put a great deal of thought into. While larger companies are, of course, able to spend more on their branding efforts, it doesn’t have to break the bank! Slapping your logo on everything you produce just won’t cut it anymore; your voice and message must be strong, consistent, and connect with your target customers. Nail this and you’ll have them coming back for more!

New primary school set to open in Birmingham in a bid to resolve shortage of places – Education Today,"['Construction', 'News', 'Primary schools']","July 6, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-primary-school-set-to-open-in-birmingham-in-a-bid-to-resolve-shortage-of-places/,"A pioneering secondary school in Birmingham is to open a new £3.5 million primary school in a bid to tackle a shortage of places in the city.
Work is underway to create a primary school for 420 pupils aged four to 11 at Bournville School, which is run by Fairfax Multi-Academy Trust.
The school will open its doors to its first pupils in September 2016, with places for 60 reception, 30 Year 1 and 30 Year 3 pupils.
The two-form entry school will continue to expand until it reaches full capacity by 2021, when it will offer 420 places for pupils across Years reception 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Four disused existing classrooms at Bournville School are currently being converted and will be refurbished in time for pupils starting in September.  Meanwhile, Birmingham City Council has approved planning permission to build a single-storey facility which will house a further four classrooms.
Work will start in October on developing the new building, which is due for completion by August 2017.
The development, funded by the Local Authority, will mean Bournville School will become an all-through school, catering for pupils aged four to 16.
The new primary school will create up to 20 jobs, with Kevin Mee being appointed as Head of Primary. Mr Mee is currently head teacher at St Joseph’s Catholic Primary School in Darlaston, which is rated ‘good’ by education watchdog Ofsted.
Bournville School’s Head of Academy Nicola Gould said: “This is an incredibly exciting time for the school as we expand to become an all-through school.
“Part of our ethos is to create a school in which pupils are able to discover their individual brilliance.
“In order to do this we need to nurture them academically, socially and emotionally.
“By starting at the school at the age of four and staying with us right up until they take their GCSEs, it means we will be able to get to know each child as an individual from an early age, developing them on an holistic level.
“We will help them to discover their true identities and give them the tools they need to let their talents shine.”
The school will be based in its own grounds, away from the secondary provision.  The Primary School will operate a different timetable to the secondary school, with its own starting and finishing times. The Primary School will also have different break and lunch times to the secondary school, as well as its own playground, main entrance and school office.
Andy Bird, CEO of Fairfax Multi-Academy Trust, said:  “We are delighted to be a pivotal part of the solution of addressing Birmingham’s shortage of primary places.
“As a Trust, we are committed to working in collaboration with the Local Authority to ensure students in Birmingham get a place at a school which is in their local area.
“It is a joy to watch as Bournville School begins its new chapter in its journey as it expands to welcome primary aged pupils.
“Bournville School will be the first all-through school to operate in South West Birmingham and it offers a truly unique opportunity for parents wanting their children to attend a school where they will be nurtured and developed from the age of four up until they are 16.
“We are an innovative and forward-thinking Trust and we are always striving to find ways to grow and strengthen our schools.
“We look forward to welcoming Bournville School’s first primary pupils in September.”
The news comes as the Department for Education and the Education Funding Agency revealed in April that one in four primary schools in the West Midlands is full or over capacity and the region is going to need another 50,000 school places by 2017.
In Birmingham, 107 out of the city’s 299 primary schools are full or have more pupils than they should, according to the figures.

The teacher behind the most creative idea will win an unforgettable Roald Dahl experience for two to three classes (up to 70 pupils) in the form of a trip to the award-winning Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre, situated in the Buckinghamshire village where Roald Dahl lived and wrote for 36 years.

Inspiring children to play the Rocksteady way – Education Today,"['Music, Stage & Drama', 'News']","July 4, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/inspiring-children-to-play-the-rocksteady-way/,"The founder of a revolutionary music school is sharing his infectious passion for music education in a brand new book, Learn to Play the Rocksteady Way. Through the eyes of children, parents and teachers, Mark Robinson explores the life-changing effect that learning to play music can have on children, demonstrating the principles behind his unique method of teaching.
As a lifelong music teacher, both in schools and privately, Mark discovered first-hand how traditional methods of learning an instrument were failing many children. He recognised that music is better when taught in a way that builds the whole child and not just their musical ability, and through Learn to Play the Rocksteady Way reveals why.
Mark founded Rocksteady Music School in 2007, guided by a combination of his own experience, philosophies on music education, and the feedback of thousands of children, parents, musicians and school teachers. Now delivering in-school music sessions to more than 4500 children each week, Rocksteady enables primary school pupils to experience the buzz of being in a band from the moment they pick up an instrument.
By learning music as a group activity, children are given the opportunity to have fun, develop socially and learn to understand the importance of teamwork and collaboration.
Mark comments: “I saw for myself that music as it’s traditionally taught – learning to read music, the need for children to own an instrument and the pressure of exams – wasn’t working for a lot of children. I spent years listening to what children were actually motivated by, which was playing their favourite songs, playing in a band and performing in concerts, and distilled these principles into a teaching method. 
“Along the way, we’ve found that our way of doing things has a very positive effect on confidence, listening and teamwork skills. I wrote the book because whenever I spoke to parents, teachers or new members of staff they were fascinated and wanted to know more – the book put these ideas in one place and is available to anyone. Education needs to be relevant to the children, as straightforward as possible and be built around their motivations. That’s what we set out to do!”
Learn to Play the Rocksteady Way is aimed at parents, teachers and musicians who believe learning music should be fun! For more information and to download the first chapter for free, visit www.rocksteadybook.uk.

Knauf AMF masters the science of sound – Education Today,"['Buildings & Maintenance', 'Infrastructure', 'News', 'Science']","June 15, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/knauf-amf-masters-the-science-of-sound/,"The University of Sunderland has been transforming its City Campus through a series of landmark building projects. The University has close links with industry, and is internationally recognised for its strong track record in pharmacy, pharmaceutical sciences, biomedical sciences and environmental sciences.
Building on this position, the University has invested £8.5 million to remodel its Sciences Complex to provide some of the most modern, well-equipped facilities in the UK. Delivered by main contractor Clugston Construction, phase one of the Complex was opened by renowned Professor of Science Lord Robert Winston. Since then, dated offices and science areas have been transformed into integrated, multi-disciplinary teaching laboratories with large preparation spaces.
Baffles and ceiling tiles from Knauf AMF were chosen for their superior quality, outstanding acoustic control and fire resistance.
Paul Barrowcliffe of Clugston Construction explains how Knauf AMF helped satisfy the client’s criteria. “We changed the ceiling specification to Knauf AMF to give the client a high quality product that was within budget. Everything arrived on time which helped us to meet the tight deadline for the build. The client is very pleased with the finished laboratories.”
Ceiling contractor, A.S. Crocker Plasterers recommended Knauf AMF for the project as Director Phil Wilson explains:
“We have worked with Knauf AMF products in the past and found them to be keenly priced, able to deliver on time and always fulfil the given criteria. I have no problem recommending Knauf AMF and their products.”
The laboratories are large areas fitted with a number of hard materials, including glass and concrete, which can create poor acoustics. To counter this, Knauf AMF baffles were installed to provide the necessary sound absorption, helping reduce the level of reverberation and improving speech intelligibility. The baffles are a versatile solution for controlling sound. By varying the distance between the rows of baffles, or changing the size of the baffles, different acoustic performances can be achieved. Knauf AMF baffles are also ideal for enhancing acoustics in thermal mass areas or where frequent and unhindered access to services is required.
Each baffle consists of two sound absorbing panels sat back-to-back in a frame. The panels are durable and offer excellent fire resistance. The surface is smooth and has an elegant appearance.  For design freedom, both the frame and the panel can be specified in a range of colours. Each baffle is suspended by discreet cable hangers which creates the impression of a weightless, elegant structure, enhancing the modern design of the laboratories.
Thermatex Alpha Hygena suspended ceilings are installed above the baffles to provide additional Class A sound control. The smooth white surface gives these ceiling tiles an elegant appearance that fits aesthetically with the interior design of the laboratory. Hygena has an anti-microbial coating which can resist bacteria and fungi making it an ideal ceiling for hospitals, healthcare facilities, kitchens and laboratories.

Foremans awarded £1.6m contract to use recycled building modules to expand one of the top-performing secondary schools in England – Education Today,"['Construction', 'Engineering', 'Infrastructure', 'News']","April 29, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/foremans-awarded-1-6m-contract-to-use-recycled-building-modules-to-expand-one-of-the-top-performing-secondary-schools-in-england/,"Foremans Relocatable Building Systems, a member of the Portakabin Group and the UK’s largest supplier of refurbished Portakabin buildings, has been awarded a £1.6 million contract to build a purpose-designed sixth form centre at Higham Lane School in Nuneaton. 
Higham Lane is the joint highest-performing state-funded secondary school in Warwickshire, and has performed within the top 100 of all secondary schools in England.  The new building, which is now under construction by Foremans, will allow the school to provide a high quality, direct, post-16 progression route for its students for the first time, maintaining standards and outcomes far above national levels.
The sixth form centre will be built by Foremans using 52 recycled and refurbished steel-framed modules. The two-storey building will be delivered in less than six months from receipt of order to be open in time for the school’s first intake of sixth form students in September this year. Cranage of the refurbished modular structure is being timed for the school holidays to minimise any disruption to teaching.
This is Foremans’ 11th school project with education construction consultants Surveyors to Education who are designers and contract administrators for the scheme.
The building will feature large amounts of glazing for a high level of natural light, with brick cladding to complement neighbouring facilities, and areas of bright red rainscreen cladding to reflect the school’s colours.
Commenting on the project, Ben Elliott, Director of Corporate Services at Higham Lane School said, “There is a shortage of quality sixth form provision in our area and feedback from students has indicated a strong preference to stay on and study for A-levels at Higham Lane School.”
“The Foremans pre-owned approach offers us significant benefits – it is very cost effective and the building will look brand new once it is completed. It is giving us more certainty to have the new sixth form up and running by September because the majority of fitting out takes place off site. Knowing that Foremans is a member of the Portakabin Group gave us even greater peace of mind along with their excellent relationship with Surveyors to Education.”
Martin Hier, Director at Surveyors to Education said, “The school wants this to be a statement building which will also blend in well with existing facilities. It is designed to meet the specific requirements of sixth form learning, which includes teaching spaces to accommodate smaller groups.”
“We have a strong and long-standing relationship with the Foremans team and enjoy pushing the boundaries on each new education scheme we collaborate on. We take a standard building solution and enhance it to meet the school’s requirements – whether that is for aesthetics or as here, specific classroom sizes.”
“We would definitely recommend recycled modular buildings to other schools and colleges. The approach is very sustainable because we are re-using an existing building structure – which is still in perfect condition, and at the same time we can reduce lead times and carbon emissions. Foremans modular buildings are also really flexible so layouts can be reconfigured to meet changing local needs.”
The Higham Lane sixth form centre will accommodate up to 300 16-19 year-old students and will have 17 seminar rooms, an art room, two science laboratories, and common room with café area.
Foremans’ 10 previous projects with Surveyors to Education have included a two-storey school complex at Billingbrook School in Northampton and a single-storey community college building with five classrooms and an IT hub at Winstanley College in Wigan.

Portakabin delivers complete interim primary school in just 14 weeks to the amazement of parents – Education Today,"['Construction', 'Engineering', 'News']","April 29, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/portakabin-delivers-complete-interim-primary-school-in-just-14-weeks-to-the-amazement-of-parents/,"Portakabin, the UK’s leading supplier of interim modular buildings, has successfully constructed and handed over a complete new 300-pupil interim primary school in Devon in less than four months. 
Working in partnership with architects and project managers, Atkins, Portakabin provided more than 1,200sqm of primary teaching accommodation for the relocation of Dartington Primary School. The scheme will be in use for the next two years and was configured as 13 school buildings and three toilet blocks with disabled access.
The project was delivered on time in a challenging timescale despite exceptionally high levels of rainfall during the programme, and the green field site immediately adjacent to the original school was highly constrained which made the building installation phase more complex.
The modular buildings have been configured to create a village feel and a welcoming environment for children with imaginative age and function-related play zones. Facilities include a kitchen fitted out with the school’s own equipment, a music room, library, pre-school nursery, 11 classrooms, and an administrative building for the staff room, head teacher’s office, general offices, sick bay, toilets and school reception.
Jill Mahon, Head Teacher at Dartington Primary School, said, “We are very happy with the buildings. The classrooms respond to the needs of the children and promote the flow of learning. The teaching areas have been configured in clusters to provide learning that is appropriate for each key stage and so that children can interact and learn from and with each other.”
“The classrooms are light, airy and calming with a friendly, positive feel. Everything on the new site works really well for our school and our style of learning. Other teaching professionals who have visited have also been very impressed.”
“Externally the layout of the buildings has been carefully designed so our children can learn outside the classrooms as well as inside. The whole interim school was constructed very easily and the area will be turned back into a field when we move to our permanent school. Parents really are amazed by the quality of the facilities and cannot believe these are interim buildings.”
Kevin Presland, Principal Architect and Project Manager at Atkins said, “Portakabin offered us the solution which would provide the least possible disruption to the school and I am pleased to report this has been successfully achieved and in a really ambitious timescale.”
“The buildings are flexible in their design and address the school’s specific requirements. We worked really well in partnership with the Portakabin team to find the optimum building solution and valued their fast and responsive approach to help us meet the urgent need for these facilities.”
The buildings arrived on site around 80 per cent fitted out, with partitions, plumbing and electrics pre-installed to reduce lead times. All internal fitting out was carried out by Portakabin and included provision of magnetic white boards for visual learning displays, access ramps, entrance canopies, and security and data communications.
The provision of high quality interim teaching accommodation allows schools and LEAs to react quickly to local needs and to provide alternative facilities for pupils when it is necessary for building projects to continue during term time.  By providing classrooms of the very highest standards and with a design life of at least 60 years, buildings from Portakabin help to ensure that there is no compromise on the quality of the learning environment.
As at Dartington Primary School, the facilities can be configured and fitted out to the exact requirements of each individual school – as learning clusters, standalone teaching blocks and generously-sized, light, modern classrooms. The buildings can be linked to existing facilities; the floor area can be increased or reduced in line with local demographic needs, and the accommodation can remain in use for as long as needed.

BBC and RSC join forces to deliver Shakespeare: Text Detectives – Education Today,"['KS3', 'News', 'Secondary schools']","April 22, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/bbc-and-rsc-join-forces-to-deliver-shakespeare-text-detectives/,"Thousands of secondary aged pupils are expected to tune in to a virtual Shakespeare lesson next week when the BBC and the RSC join forces to deliver Shakespeare: Text Detectives – the first Live Lesson about Shakespeare for secondary school aged pupils.
In the month that marks both Shakespeare’s birthday and the 400th anniversary of his death, the 45 minute Live Lesson will take place on Monday 25 April at 11am. The lesson comes hot on the heels of the first BBC/RSC Shakespeare Live Lesson aimed at primary schools which attracted an estimated audience of 21,600 children last month.
Hosted by CBBC presenters, Ed Petrie and Naomi Wilkinson, the Live Lesson is aimed at Key Stage 3/3rd Level students and features RSC actors Akiya Henry, Joseph Arkley and Rina Mahoney. Together the hosts and actors will lead pupils through a series of hands-on, interactive activities to explore Shakespeare’s use of sonnets, iambic pentameter and antithesis in a fun and engaging way.
Any school can take part and are invited to log on to www.bbc.co.uk/livelessons to access the live stream and explore Romeo and Juliet by searching for clues in the text that help to unlock meaning, language and the techniques that Shakespeare used to hook his audience in.Students can also send in their questions to be answered by experts as part of the live webcast.
Commenting on the initiative, Jacqui O’Hanlon, Director of Education for the RSC, said: “It’s great to be teaming up with BBC Learning to explore a play that represents for so many students their first encounter with Shakespeare’s work. The Live Lessons are already well established and alongside our regular free Schools’ Broadcast series  (where we stream our productions for free into schools across the UK), this is a brilliant way for us to take our work and our approaches to teaching Shakespeare and his plays out to a whole new audience. We hope to surprise students, and perhaps even teachers, with new ideas about the play as well as explore the range of interpretive possibilities it offers.”
Sinead Rocks, Head of BBC Learning, says: “BBC Learning is pleased to working with the RSC to bring the best of the BBC’s programme-making skills and on-screen talent directly into classrooms while reinforcing the BBC’s commitment to formal education. Live Lessons have been designed to bring innovative and inspiring curriculum-linked content to life whilst also providing an opportunity for thousands of children to participate in a shared learning experience.

When is the best time of year to ski? – Education Today,['News'],"February 17, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/when-is-the-best-time-of-year-to-ski/,"Die-hard ski enthusiasts who are willing to travel to the reaches of Australia, New Zealand, Chile or Argentina may find that they are able to ski all year round. However, unless you are willing to travel the world in search of snowy runs throughout the year, your best bet to find the best ski conditions are to stick within the traditional ski season.
The skiing season runs from December to April in most ski resorts, especially those throughout Europe. However, you can find good deals and snowy mountains as early as November and as late as May, before the lifts shut for the season, if you are willing to search high up in the mountains. This is usually only a good idea for more experienced skiers as the beginner runs are usually found lower down the mountain where the snow can be wet and slushy in these months, if there is any snow at all at that time.
The ski season
The skiing season truly start in December but even at this stage, not all low and even medium altitude ski resorts will be guaranteed to have snow. There are resorts in Europe which use fake snow generating machines to top up any thin snow fall but you may find that your best bet to guarantee optimal ski conditions is to travel to America or the Canadian Rockies at this early point in the season.
January is one of the busiest months in the ski season as travellers look for post-Christmas breaks. With most of the European resorts now experiencing much more snowfall, you will need to book early to guarantee you and your party can take advantage of the fresh powder on the mountainsides. If you are after a quieter experience and are willing to travel then North America or Japan are great alternative locations.
February is the month in which you are bound to find the best snow of the season. It is also quite a busy time across Europe as the French school half-term break falls in this month. However, if a busy and lovely atmosphere is what you are after, then February is the month for you.
With longer days and slightly warmer conditions, March skiing is often moved up the mountain. Lower altitude resorts may find that their beginner runs are turning slightly slushy. On the bright side, your will often find a good deal to be had taking your ski trip in March as prices are often much lower than for the rest of the season.
Over recent years, April has seen some of the biggest snowfalls of the season due to winter shifting forwards by several weeks. However, the best snow is still found at higher altitudes as lower altitude resorts begin to find that slushy conditions make it hard for beginners. On the highest altitude resorts, you will often find perfect conditions that will last through to May, when the lifts close for the season.
Pick your dates wisely
While the ski season lasts for several months, conditions will vary dramatically throughout that time. When booking your ski trip it is important to consider the varying levels of skill and experience within your group to ensure that you get good conditions for everyone. Many European ski resorts will top up their snowfall with fake snow to guarantee the best ski conditions on all of their runs so do your research before booking.

Overview of the Updated National Curriculum for Geography – Education Today,['News'],"February 12, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/overview-of-the-updated-national-curriculum-for-geography/,"The National Curriculum is constantly being reviewed and improved, and various subjects are often updated and implemented into schools up and down the country. We have a National Curriculum to ensure each student receives a particular level of education, by outlining structures within each subject on what children should be taught. In order to keep up with some of the best education systems from around the world, the National Curriculum changes every now and again to ensure future students receive the best possible education.
There has been a new approach to the National Curriculum over recent years; it now sets out the core knowledge that pupils should learn, but doesn’t necessarily specify any approaches in how teachers should teach. This appears to have now been left up to the discretion of each school that follows the National Curriculum.
For over 20 years, the National Curriculum has been revised and over the next couple of years there are a number of changes to be put in place, including some changes that have already happened.
Subject area: Geography
There have been a number of differences in the way Geography is now to be approached in the National Curriculum. It was decided that there would be a renewed emphasis on both locational and place knowledge, as well as the human and physical processes. Alongside this, some technical procedures should be covered such as using grid references.
There should also be a renewed commitment towards the concept of fieldwork and the use of maps, as well as written communication.
Key Stage 1 Geography
The National Curriculum includes certain topics that should be included, but not necessarily how they should be taught. For example, the focus at key stage 1 should be developing knowledge about the world, the United Kingdom and their locality. Pupils at this stage should be taught certain facts such as the world’s seven continents and their locations, and naming and identifying the four countries and capital cities of the UK. Trips to London may include extra curricular education that can aid pupil’s understanding of the United Kingdom.
In terms of human and physical geography, pupils should be able to identify seasonal weather patterns and identify hot and cold areas of the world. Pupils at key stage 1 should also be able to use world maps and globes to identify the UK and other countries or oceans studied at this stage.
Key Stage 2 Geography
As they progress, pupils should be expected to extend their knowledge to include Europe, North and South America as well as significant human and physical features. Pupils should be able to identify the position of latitude, longitude, Equator and other large features of the world such as the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.
Pupils at key stage 2 should now be taught more physical geography including the climate zones, biomes and features such as volcanoes and earthquakes. Trips to destinations such as Iceland could encourage further learning about some of the world’s physical geography.
There is a huge emphasis on geographical skills at this stage; pupils should be able to use the eight points of a compass, four and six-figure grid references and keys on Ordnance Survey maps in order to build on their knowledge.
Key Stage 3 Geography
Knowledge at this stage should include Africa, Russia, Asia and the Middle East, with a focus on their environmental regions such as deserts as well as major cities. Visiting places such as Morocco is the perfect place for curious geographers, with the Sahara Desert on your doorstep.
Physical geography should concentrate on geological timescales and plate tectonics and the change in climate over the years, from the Ice Age to the present day. There should also been some emphasis on how human activity relies on effective natural systems, and how human and physical processes interact to influence and change landscapes and environments.
Pupils at key stage 3 should be able to collect and analyse geographical data, and build further on their knowledge of globes and maps.
Of course, one of the best ways to enrich the National Curriculum, especially with Geography, is to visit such major cities and key physical characteristics. Taking an educational trip to further pupils’ understanding of the world they live in would provide a unique experience to enhance their learning. Using a company that organises such trips, like Adaptable Travel, could provide a once in a lifetime opportunity for many students up and down the country.",the national curriculum is constantly being reviewed and improved and various subject are often updated and implemented into school up and down the country we have a national curriculum to ensure each student receives a particular level of education by outlining structure within each subject on what child should be taught in order to keep up with some of the best education system from around the world the national curriculum change every now and again to ensure future student receive the best possible education there ha been a new approach to the national curriculum over recent year it now set out the core knowledge that pupil should learn but doesnt necessarily specify any approach in how teacher should teach this appears to have now been left up to the discretion of each school that follows the national curriculum for over year the national curriculum ha been revised and over the next couple of year there are a number of change to be put in place including some change that have already happened subject area geography there have been a number of difference in the way geography is now to be approached in the national curriculum it wa decided that there would be a renewed emphasis on both locational and place knowledge a well a the human and physical process alongside this some technical procedure should be covered such a using grid reference there should also be a renewed commitment towards the concept of fieldwork and the use of map a well a written communication key stage geography the national curriculum includes certain topic that should be included but not necessarily how they should be taught for example the focus at key stage should be developing knowledge about the world the united kingdom and their locality pupil at this stage should be taught certain fact such a the world seven continent and their location and naming and identifying the four country and capital city of the uk trip to london may include extra curricular education that can aid pupil understanding of the united kingdom in term of human and physical geography pupil should be able to identify seasonal weather pattern and identify hot and cold area of the world pupil at key stage should also be able to use world map and globe to identify the uk and other country or ocean studied at this stage key stage geography a they progress pupil should be expected to extend their knowledge to include europe north and south america a well a significant human and physical feature pupil should be able to identify the position of latitude longitude equator and other large feature of the world such a the tropic of cancer and capricorn pupil at key stage should now be taught more physical geography including the climate zone biome and feature such a volcano and earthquake trip to destination such a iceland could encourage further learning about some of the world physical geography there is a huge emphasis on geographical skill at this stage pupil should be able to use the eight point of a compass four and sixfigure grid reference and key on ordnance survey map in order to build on their knowledge key stage geography knowledge at this stage should include africa russia asia and the middle east with a focus on their environmental region such a desert a well a major city visiting place such a morocco is the perfect place for curious geographer with the sahara desert on your doorstep physical geography should concentrate on geological timescales and plate tectonics and the change in climate over the year from the ice age to the present day there should also been some emphasis on how human activity relies on effective natural system and how human and physical process interact to influence and change landscape and environment pupil at key stage should be able to collect and analyse geographical data and build further on their knowledge of globe and map of course one of the best way to enrich the national curriculum especially with geography is to visit such major city and key physical characteristic taking an educational trip to further pupil understanding of the world they live in would provide a unique experience to enhance their learning using a company that organises such trip like adaptable travel could provide a once in a lifetime opportunity for many student up and down the country,"['new', 'renewed', 'educational', 'geographer', 'teach', 'updated', 'learning', 'curriculum', 'teacher', 'education']"
Altro Sets The Bar High At University Of Bath’s Sports Training Village – Education Today,['News'],"January 6, 2016",https://www.education-today.co.uk/altro-sets-the-bar-high-at-university-of-baths-sports-training-village/,"Altro safety flooring and hygienic wall cladding are providing the highest standard of safety, hygiene and aesthetics for athletes at the University of Bath’s renowned £30 million Sports Training Village (STV).
The STV is an indoor and outdoor facility that accommodates more than 50 sports and regularly hosts major international competitions, as well as being a world-class multi-sport training environment. There has been major investment in improving the facilities at the STV, including a £1.6m refit to the swimming pool, which included Altro WhiterockTM hygienic wall cladding in the changing area.
More recently, Altro Whiterock was chosen again, alongside Altro AquariusTM safety flooring, for the refurbishment of the dry changing areas.
STV Sports Facilities Manager, Ron Stewart, explains why Altro has been selected for these projects. “The University has been using Altro Whiterock for many years as standard in its shower areas, so we know that it’s a great product — superb quality, easy to clean and with a contemporary look.
“We didn’t hesitate in choosing Altro Whiterock for the swimming pool wet changing refurbishment. The existing walls were a very poor quality laminated product which looked pretty dreadful. The Altro Whiterock was a huge improvement, as we knew it would be, and has made all the difference in terms of creating a cleaner, more modern-looking space, quality and easy maintenance.”
Altro Whiterock White is the hygienic alternative to tiles that’s impact resistant, grout-free and easy to clean. Its smooth white surface and classical purity make it a timeless choice for any interior. Made from a high-quality, food-safe PVCu polymer, Altro Whiterock can handle temperatures up to 60°C. It meets all current European Union (EU) Directives on health and hygiene.
Ron continues: “For the refurbishment of the dry changing area, Altro Whiterock was number one choice again, but we also needed to find a much better quality vinyl safety flooring, because what we had was terrible. It was costing us a fortune to patch up because it kept cracking, and the joints were failing. We wanted a serious upgrade in quality, a modern product that looked great, and something that would stand the test of time and be easy to clean.
“Our project manager gave us a range of samples to assess, but he very much recommended that Altro Aquarius was the right product for us, because of its safety properties for combined wet and dry areas, colour choices, and proven track record in similar environments.”
Altro Aquarius was developed to deliver optimum slip resistance in combined wet and dry areas, with shoes or bare feet — so it’s ideal for bathrooms and changing areas. Like all Altro safety flooring products, Altro Aquarius offers sustained slip resistance for the lifetime of the product, keeping your risk of a slip to just one in a million. The 2mm range features plain and tonal chip options, including an on-trend indigo shade to help achieve high contrast and design flexibility. It’s also easy to clean, with Altro Easyclean Maxis PUR technology.
The Altro flooring and hygienic wall cladding was fitted by Quadrant Contract Flooring, who have use Altro products for more than 20 years. Quadrant Contracts Director Simon Allan, says: “In the past 10 years we have added Altro Whiterock to our portfolio, alongside Altro flooring, because we were getting so many enquiries that it made sense to offer both as part of our service.
“We specify Altro for the majority of our work because we believe it’s the best on the market. It’s British-made, so supply is always good, and the support we get from Altro is great.
“The installation of Altro flooring in the changing areas wasn’t without its challenges. The area was redesigned to be open plan, but the floor levels were not uniform, which meant we had to do a lot of work to ensure they were even. There were also some moisture issues, which required laying a dpm. Like all Altro products, Altro Aquarius is very easy to work with, and goes down well. We used AltroFix 19 Plus adhesive to lay the flooring.
“The Altro Whiterock fitting went well too,” adds Simon. “It was a two-phase operation, but it’s a quick product to put up, so despite a very tight time schedule we were able to finish on time — fitting 214m2 in one week using a two-part joint system.”
Ikon Construction were the main contractor for the refurbishment at the STV. Operations Manager Mike Clements said: “We were very pleased with the quality of Quadrant’s installation of the Altro flooring and wall cladding. We work a great deal with Quadrant on a wide range of projects and they are always professional, co-operative and deliver a superb result.”
Ron Stewart adds: “I am delighted with the Altro products used. The installation was handled well and was delivered to a very short working window.
“The Altro Whiterock looks great, we will continue to use it and recommend it wherever there is a need here. It’s so easy to clean as well, which is major bonus for our maintenance staff.
“The Altro Aquarius looks perfect, the colour is just right, it’s feels great underfoot and the feedback has been very positive about every aspect of it, including the cleaning regime. It is certainly proving to be exactly the right choice, and has helped transform our changing areas into something we are really proud of.”",altro safety flooring and hygienic wall cladding are

Visualise will use its innovative 360° live video streaming technology to create a ‘virtual event’ bringing Sutherland into over 100 schools.
Visualise’s technology and Google Cardboard VR headsets will allow over 10,000 students from all over the country to watch Rory Sutherland’s opening speech at the Bishop Challoner Catholic Collegiate School as if they were right in the classroom with him. He will give students an insight into working in the digital industry and the exciting career opportunities within the sector.
Digital Day brings together schools and digital agencies to raise awareness of digital career opportunities. Recent research shows that by 2020 the UK’s economy will require 2.3m digitally skilled workers. BIMA has brought its Digital Day initiative to life in order to help meet this demand and encourage schools to educate their students on the vast amount of exciting digital career opportunities available to them.
The day will see students working alongside digital industry professionals creating new digital ideas and concepts in response to three different challenges, provided by sponsors Vodafone, Sony Music and Standard Life.
Bridget Beale, MD at BIMA, said: “Rory Sutherland is an extremely inspiring ambassador for the digital industry and we’re thrilled that he will be addressing potential future digital stars. For anyone who has seen Rory’s TED talks, they’ll be aware how inspiring he is in 2D! Partnering with Visualise and Ogilvy to bring Rory into classrooms across the UK is an exciting step forward for the Digital Day initiative. We can’t wait to have our minds blown at Digital Day.”

Delta Security ensures a ‘ring of steel’ around north London primary school – Education Today,['News'],"October 12, 2015",https://www.education-today.co.uk/delta-security-ensures-a-ring-of-steel-around-north-london-primary-school/,"Delta Security, the CCTV and access control specialists, has extended its 18-year partnership with the Stoke Newington-based Sir Thomas Abney Primary School, to deliver the very latest wireless-based ‘ring of steel’ to protect pupils, visitors and staff.
Two new systems have been installed: a Salto wireless electronic locking system that requires a keycard ID pass that automatically synchronises with the locks to allow or restrict access; and EntrySign, an easy-to-use touch-screen interface with the ability to pre-register guests, and significantly increase the accuracy of knowing who is on site at any given time.
Coral Wasylenczuk, School Business Manager at Sir Thomas Abney, says that the latter integrates the entire existing security infrastructure onto a central platform:
“Both our legacy technology and the new systems are now fully integrated to give us a complete system overview,” she explains. “It means that it is not only more efficient, but also more accurate in accounting for everyone on-site in case of an emergency. Simply put, we now have an electronic ‘ring of steel’ around the school and feel much more secure.”
The school has always prided itself on maintaining the safety of its 430 students and staff, as Coral continues: “Delta is integral to our gaining an ‘Outstanding’ grade from Ofsted in the ‘Behaviour and Safety of Pupils’ category, after an inspection this year,” she says.
“It always provides competitive rates with excellent service provision, working around our needs and timescale – and being a local company is an added bonus,” she concludes.
Dave Mundy, Operations Manager at Delta Security, says that proven, long-term relationships are important to gaining a customer’s trust: “Security is important in many industries, but few are as important as education, where the welfare and safety of children is paramount.
“Delta has established a niche expertise in this sector, and is pleased to continue working with Coral and her team in delivering best-in-class security for a best-in-class school.”

Schools urged to sign up to Jeans for Genes Day this month – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'Fund raising', 'News']","September 2, 2015",https://www.education-today.co.uk/schools-urged-to-sign-up-to-jeans-for-genes-day-this-month/,"Jeans for Genes Day is celebrating its 20th year of fundraising for children with genetic disorders on Friday 18th September 2015, and this year a host of celebrities are backing the campaign including Kate Moss, Amanda Holden and SpongeBob Square Pants.
Jeans for Genes Day is a fun and educational mass participation event that brings schools together to raise money for children with genetic disorders. The charity is encouraging schools to register to take part as soon as the Autumn term starts, and to participate in what promises to be the biggest and best Jeans for Genes Day since the event first started back in 1996.
Schools can sign up via the website and will receive free educational materials tailored to early years and all key stages, which have been designed to help schools make the most of their Jeans for Genes Day activities, plus toolkits, assembly and fundraising ideas and event check lists.
Since 1996, schools have played the biggest part in raising money for Jeans for Genes and so far, over 15,000 schools across the UK have organised a Jeans for Genes Day event. Many schools have supported the cause for multiple years and Essendene Lodge Primary School in Caterham, Surrey has been supporting the charity for 20 years as has Ravensbourne School in Romford, Essex.
The charity’s top fundraising primary schools are Leeds Grammar School, who donated over £16,000, Berkhamsted School in Hertfordshire, who donated over £8,000 and Cairnshill Primary School in Belfast, who have also donated over £8,000.
The charity’s top fundraising secondary schools are Calday Grange Grammar School on the Wirral, who donated over £25,000, Fields Grammar School in Lisburn, Co Antrim, who have donated over £20,000 and Imberhorne school in East Grinstead who have donated over £19,000.
It is estimated that 1 in 25 children are affected by a genetic disorder and 30,000 babies and children are newly diagnosed in the UK each year. Some genetic disorders are apparent at birth while others are diagnosed at different stages throughout childhood, and sometimes into adulthood.
Jeans for Genes Day has been raising funds to help children affected by some of the most serious and life-threatening genetic disorders. Over the last 20 years, a sea of denim has swept across the UK as the British public have taken up the Jeans for Genes Day banner and helped raise over £40million.
Caroline Harding, Chief Executive of Jeans for Genes Day, says: “Over the last 20 years we’ve had phenomenal support from schools who have really championed Jeans for Genes Day. This year we are urging teachers, pupils and school councils to once again consider participating in our very special anniversary fundraiser.
“Just by wearing jeans and making a donation, schools have already helped us to raise millions of pounds to provide vital care and support for children with genetic disorders. To mark our 20th anniversary, we’re asking pupils and teachers to go the extra mile and do something extraordinary in jeans to improve the lives and experience of children and families affected by genetic disorders.
“Throughout September we expect to see denim fever sweep across the country as high profile celebrities and schools get involved and show their support. We’re excited to announce a team of synchronised swimmers will be performing in jeans as well as a ballet house rehearsing Swan Lake in denim.”

First class surfaces for student halls – Education Today,['News'],"September 1, 2015",https://www.education-today.co.uk/first-class-surfaces-for-student-halls/,"Manchester student accommodation, Liberty Living at Sir Charles Groves Hall, has recently been refurbished to include Max-Top Quartz surfaces in all 78 flats.
Auxillium Property Solutions Ltd managed the project and selected the Diamond White Sparkle worktop for all kitchen and breakfast bars in the halls due to its durability and stylish finish.
Dale Cross, managing director of Auxillium Property Solutions Ltd, commented: “Max-Top Quartz offered a solution that was easy to install, aesthetically pleasing and above all, more durable than standard laminate worktops – a factor that is extremely important for student accommodation.
“It is important to consider the full life cost of any product we recommend, and the quality of Max-Top Quartz surfaces will mean that replacing the worktops every three to four years will be a thing of the past.”
Max-Top Quartz, which is available in up to 10 finishes and comes with a 25 year guarantee, is a unique product in the surface market. Featuring a patented interior honeycomb structure, the product offers the aesthetic benefits of a solid stone surface, with the advantage of a deeper 40mm profile.
Stephen Moss, managing director of Max-Top, commented: “Our modular quartz surfaces have been a real success in residential environments where strength and durability is paramount, this is particularly relevant for student accommodation and we are currently working on a number of projects in this sector.
“As our products are lightweight, installation takes no time at all and this can be extremely helpful when planning a large-scale project of this kind.”
Dale Cross concludes: “We are very happy with the product, but more importantly, the client is delighted! The new surfaces create a brilliant finish and are going to last for years to come.”

State ‘old school tie’ network inspires current generation of students – Education Today,"['Careers', 'News', 'Secondary schools']","June 30, 2015",https://www.education-today.co.uk/state-old-school-tie-network-inspires-current-generation-of-students/,"A caterer, an actress and an accountant were among professionals going back to their old school to inspire the current generation to academic success and career confidence under a scheme setting up ‘old school tie’ networks in state schools and colleges.
Sixteen alumni returned to Parliament Hill School, Highgate Road, London, part of the LaSWAP sixth form consortium, under the initiative to encourage state student social mobility by enabling schools to harness the talent and expertise of former students.
The initiative is run by the national education charity Future First which works in more than 400 state schools and colleges across Britain linking schools with their former students who act as career and education role models, mentors, work experience providers, governors, fundraisers and donors.
The LaSWAP alumni took part in a workshop carousel with 60 lower sixth form students (Year 12s) helping them think about the skills they need for life after school and how to draft personal statements and post 16 applications.
Three alumni, a legal secretary, a sales optimisation manager at a travel company and a management consultancy analyst, returned under the City of London Corporation funded “Inspiring City Role Models” scheme intended to create a talent pipeline into City jobs in which workers from the Square Mile return to their old state school in City fringe boroughs.
Other alumni (former students of LaSWAP schools but not working in the City) include an accountant, a company director, a press officer, a lecturer, a marketing manager at the toy store Hamleys, a caterer and businesswoman, an actress and a philosophy consultant.
Teacher Nicky King said, “We’re always looking for links with industry and this is such a great way of building confidence.”
Alumna and actress Luisa Guerreiro said, “When I was a student I would have really appreciated having a point of contact to ask the questions that I asked myself then. As an alumna, I hope to inspire and assist all students who may have questions and perhaps act as a point of call to those who aspire to a life in performance.”
Alex Shapland-Howes, Managing Director of Future First, said, “More than 39 per cent of state school students don’t know anyone in a job they’d like to do. If they see that someone who went to the same school and grew up in the same community, has achieved a fulfilling and satisfying job, it helps them to see that it’s possible for them too.
“It’s really important for all students to be motivated to succeed in the working world and hearing first hand  from relatable people in interesting jobs can make a huge difference.”
Mark Boleat, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation which funds the “Inspiring City Role Models” scheme, added, “This programme is essential in providing young people with positive role models that they can identify with. For many young people in boroughs like Camden, City jobs seem a world away. Connecting sixth formers with people that are succeeding in the Square Mile will help raise their aspiration and highlight the opportunities for high skilled and rewarding careers.”

Start-ups invited to celebrate the future of education technology at Bett 2016 – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News']","June 11, 2015",https://www.education-today.co.uk/start-ups-invited-to-celebrate-the-future-of-education-technology-at-bett-2016/,"Following its success in 2015, Futures is returning to Bett 2016, providing inspirational ed-tech start-ups with the opportunity to showcase their products and services to more than 35,000 visitors.
As the new purpose-built home for the world’s most inspiring ed-tech start-ups, Futures was launched at Bett 2015, in collaboration with the UK’s leading education think-tank, The Education Foundation. Located right at the heart of the action of the Bett show floor, the area was introduced to celebrate brave thinking, innovative new products and education ‘game changers’.
Designed as a unique, three-year progression programme, Futures offers developing start-up companies an opportunity to benefit from all that Bett has to offer, but with heavily subsidised exhibition rates (choice of two packages based on market status). Exhibitors also benefit from marketing resources including digital and social media promotion, and speaking opportunities on the Futures stage.
In 2015, the inaugural cohort was made up of 30 companies selected by a panel of education experts, based on the relevance of their solutions to today’s classroom challenges. The Future area showcased the most innovative developments in ed-tech; from teacher-parent communication tools and 3D printing, to language learning and adaptive maths apps. The 2016 cohort will be a combination of both returning Futures start-up exhibitors and new start-up companies that have recently launched.
Debbie French, portfolio director of Bett comments: “There was a huge buzz around the Futures area at Bett 2015, and what it offered our visitors was completely unique. Our aim was to give those 30 companies the chance to engage with all that Bett has to offer, in a way that made was affordable to them and made them stand out from the crowd. The feedback we’ve received from those start-ups suggests that we achieved that, and judging by the crowds throughout the show, it suited our visitors’ needs to. Our panel of judges consists of teachers, entrepreneurs and industry experts, and for Bett 2016 they are again searching for the most innovative and relevant ideas that truly meet the challenges that educators and learners are faced with. We’re looking forward to what Futures 2016 will bring!”
James Sutherland, director at Bett Futures 2015 start-up company, The Publishing Foundry says: “Bett Futures has helped us form some invaluable relationships; from the wealth of information, knowledge and experience that we gained from Bett we have developed our offering further and have seen our growth in business exceed 220% of forecast ytd. Without the Bett Futures offering we could not have considered being at Bett at the size of company and stage that we were at, however, thanks to Bett Futures we are now growing faster than planned and seeing the great successes, just 4 months later.”
Ty Goddard / Ian Fordham, co-founder of the Education Foundation add: “We’re very pleased to be working in partnership with Bett again on this venture! The success of Futures at Bett 2015 proved that it is the ideal platform for dynamic new businesses and start-ups working in the education sector. Futures enables us to continue supporting teacher entrepreneurs and new companies, and we look forward to building on the UK’s ed-tech start-up ecosystem that Bett 2015 started.

Year 7 girl wins dream family holiday – Education Today,"['Competition', 'KS3', 'Literacy', 'News', 'Reward & Recognition']","May 5, 2015",https://www.education-today.co.uk/year-7-girl-wins-dream-family-holiday/,"A Birmingham year 7 has landed a dream family holiday worth £600 after winning a regional literacy skills competition for schools.
Kirsty Duggins, age 12, of Smith’s Wood Sports College, Solihull, came out on top in a public vote on the website of competition organisers Everywhere Travel  for her dream holiday write up on Centre Parcs – which was based on childhood memories from her first visit as a toddler. She polled 806 votes, which was some 300 more than her nearest competitor.
An ecstatic Kirsty explains: “I am so happy to have won a holiday for my family and still can’t quite believe it. I am really looking forward to having fun doing some of the cool type of activities I wrote about. It will be really exciting as I’ll get to do awesome things I’ve always wanted to try, like aqua jetting, rock climbing and tree trekking, plus I get to take my best friend Darcy Dolaghan (also year 7 at Smith’s Wood Sports College) too.”
David Sims, Key Stage 3 Progress Manager at Smith’s Wood Sports College, says: “I am so very pleased that Kirsty has won this competition. It was a tight contest, with many students from all over the region submitting pieces of high quality work that showed both excellent written skills and good imaginations, but Kirsty did really well at producing a finished article that was a cut above the rest. Her consistent high standards of effort and behaviour are a credit to her and an excellent example for the rest of her peers. We are grateful to Everywhere Travel to have offered our school this opportunity, and see it as one of many examples of how in life hard work and high standards pay dividends.”
Proud mum Deborah Duggins says: “We are really proud of Kirsty’s achievement and thrilled that she will be whisking us away on holiday. How very lucky is it to be taken away by your 12- year-old daughter. We did think we’d be going to Centre Parcs, but she’s gone for the similar Haven Holiday Park in Burnham-On-Sea instead, so we’re off to sunny Somerset in August!”
Everywhere Travel managing director, Stephanie O’Reilly, says: “All our finalists really embraced the competition and the quality of their writing was very high. But Kirsty’s lovely worded piece just had a little bit more about it and she deserved to win after polling 40% of the overall votes.”",a birmingham year ha landed a dream family holiday worth after winning a regional literacy skill competition for school kirsty duggins age of smith wood sport college solihull came out on top in a public vote on the website of competition organiser everywhere travel for her dream holiday write up on centre parcs which wa based on childhood memory from her first visit a a toddler she polled vote which wa some more than her nearest competitor an ecstatic kirsty explains i am so happy to have won a holiday for my family and still cant quite believe it i am really looking forward to having fun doing some of the cool type of activity i wrote about it will be really exciting a ill get to do awesome thing ive always wanted to try like aqua jetting rock climbing and tree trekking plus i get to take my best friend darcy dolaghan also year at smith wood sport college too david sims key stage progress manager at smith wood sport college say i am so very pleased that kirsty ha won this competition it wa a tight contest with many student from all over the region submitting piece of high quality work that showed both excellent written skill and good imagination but kirsty did really well at producing a finished article that wa a cut above the rest her consistent high standard of effort and behaviour are a credit to her and an excellent example for the rest of her peer we are grateful to everywhere travel to have offered our school this opportunity and see it a one of many example of how in life hard work and high standard pay dividend proud mum deborah duggins say we are really proud of kirstys achievement and thrilled that she will be whisking u away on holiday how very lucky is it to be taken away by your yearold daughter we did think wed be going to centre parcs but shes gone for the similar haven holiday park in burnhamonsea instead so were off to sunny somerset in august everywhere travel managing director stephanie oreilly say all our finalist really embraced the competition and the quality of their writing wa very high but kirstys lovely worded piece just had a little bit more about it and she deserved to win after polling of the overall vote,"['toddler', 'ecstatic', 'contest', 'competitor', 'competition', 'holiday', 'sunny', 'winning', 'daughter', 'finalist']"
Range Rover Evoque WISE Scholarship applications  – Education Today,"['Awards', 'Bursaries', 'Engineering', 'News', 'STEM']","April 1, 2015",https://www.education-today.co.uk/range-rover-evoque-wise-scholarship-applications/,"WISE and Jaguar Land Rover today open the 2015 Range Rover Evoque WISE Scholarship, aimed at young women planning a career in technology and engineering in the UK.
Launched in 2013 by Zara Phillips, the Scholarship is open to those embarking on or currently undertaking an engineering, maths or physics degree course or apprenticeship in the UK this year. The funding programme aims to boost female participation in these disciplines, with the winners receiving £1,000 per year for their studies (up to three years) and professional mentoring to support their path into engineering.
As in 2014, the scholarship programme has been expanded to create two separate awards – one for an undergraduate and the other for an apprentice.
Last year’s winner for the Apprentice Award was Ruby Holmes, currently working through her Advanced Technical apprenticeship at Rolls-Royce. She commented: “I felt honoured to be awarded the Range Rover Evoque WISE Scholarship in 2014 and it is great to see it open again for 2015, giving a helping hand to more young women like me. The programme provides fantastic support, both from a financial and mentorship viewpoint, and I am personally really excited to be working as an ambassador, encouraging more girls to choose amazing careers in the industry.”
Ruby’s mentor and WISE Young Women’s Board Member, Hannah Goodall, Senior Engineer [Switches & Crossings] for Network Rail comments: I’m really looking forward to regularly meeting with Ruby to discuss her career aspirations. Winning the Range Rover Evoque WISE scholarship so early into her career is such an achievement. I believe mentoring relationships have a positive impact on career development. I hope to be able to support and challenge Ruby, introduce new ideas and discuss positive steps Ruby can take going forward.”
Whilst the number of young women embarking on a technology or engineering course in the UK is on the rise, there are still significant challenges for the female engineers of the future. Chloe Pickford-Adams, who was delighted to be a winner of the Undergraduate scholarship in 2014, says: “I hope to dedicate time throughout my engineering career to an ambassadorial role in order to inspire others to explore a career in engineering”.
Currently women account for less than 10% of professional engineers in the UK and the Range Rover Evoque WISE Scholarship highlights Jaguar Land Rover’s commitment to increasing the number of female engineers in the UK.
Nicci Cook, Jaguar Land Rover Senior HR Manager Product Development, said: “Since the inaugural year we have seen some amazing winners come through the Scholarship, and we are delighted to be running the programme for a third year. Jaguar Land Rover is constantly striving to encourage more young women into the industry and through programmes such as the Range Rover Evoque WISE Scholarship we hope to maintain the UK’s reputation as a centre of excellence for engineering for a long time to come.”
The selection process will include an application form and interview. The closing date for applications is 28 July 2015. The winner will be announced in London at the prestigious Annual WISE Awards & conference on 12 November 2015. You can apply for the scholarship online here.

West Midlands pupils vie for dream family holiday prize – Education Today,"['Competition', 'KS3', 'Literacy', 'News']","March 16, 2015",https://www.education-today.co.uk/west-midlands-pupils-vie-for-dream-family-holiday-prize/,"Eight excited Year 7s from schools across Birmingham and Solihull are vying for a dream family holiday prize worth £600 after winning through to a regional competition final.
But they need your help – because a public vote will now decide which pupil will be whisking their loved ones away for a bumper British family holiday courtesy of local online agency specialists Everywhere Travel.
Two pupils each have been selected from Perry Beeches II and Perry Beeches III Free Schools on Newhall Street and Langley Walk in central Birmingham respectively, plus Alderbrook Secondary School on Blossomfield Road, Solihull and Smith’s Wood Sports College on Windward Way, North Solihull – and you can view each of their excellent entries via this web link and vote (just the once mind!) for your favourite.
The eight finalists (all age 11) are Aaron Pedley and Micaela Cappelli, (Perry Beeches II), Ashaea Tweede-Waite and Kai Thompson (Perry Beeches III), Liam Barron and Mia Whitehouse (Alderbrook School), plus Kirsty Duggins and Rachel Casey (Smith’s Wood).
The brief was to describe their perfect holiday week in just 150- 250 words, highlighting factors like location & travel, how would you spend your time, the weather and cuisine, plus the attractions and activities available?
Everywhere Travel managing director, Stephanie O’Reilly, explains: “Both teachers and pupils have really embraced the competition and the quality and quantity of entries has been very high. A lot of thought has obviously gone into all the hundreds of entries we received, but the eight we’ve chosen as finalists just had a little bit more about them and certainly got the team and I wishing we could visit the places described.
“The eventual winner will enjoy their once-in-a-lifetime dream family holiday – hopefully combining the elements described within their entry – and we’ve made it a UK based prize on the basis we have lots of untold gems here within the British Isles and they should get a lot more holiday for their prize money.”
Grant Jones, Head of Performing Arts and PE at Perry Beeches III, says: “This fantastic competition involved the majority of our year 7 students writing about their dream holiday during extended literacy sessions. It clearly sparked the imagination as they described their most desirable locations and activities in a creative and entertaining piece of writing.”
Finalist Ashaea says: “The school was very happy that Kai and I got into the final round, so I hope one of us wins the holiday because I don’t think I’ll ever have so much fun in my life again. Everywhere Travel rules!
Kai adds: “Being in the final round of the Everywhere Travel competition makes me feel ecstatic. The support from everyone has made me feel stupendous and I now feel like I can do anything.”
John Jarrett, Year 7 Deputy Head at Perry Beeches II, says: “The Everywhere Travel competition is a brilliant way for students to express their imagination and ability to write. They were able to contextualise skills they had learnt in their lessons and I was delighted to see the amount and quality of entries from our school.”
Finalist Aaron says: “I’m extremely happy to represent the school, plus if I win I get to spend quality time with my family”. Micaela adds: “I feel nervous and excited at the same time because I’m a finalist. Arriving at this stage is scary but makes you feel proud and happy too. I hope to win!”
Laura Usefnia, English & PE teacher at Alderbrook School, says: “It’s created a real buzz amongst our Year 7s and it was very pleasing to see them all on tenterhooks during assembly when our two finalists, Liam and Mia, were announced. They both seem really proud to be representing the school in this very worthwhile and engaging competition.”
Finalist Mia Whitehouse says: “I was really pleased to make the shortlist, then shocked to be picked as an actual school finalist, so I’m going to ask all my family and friends to vote for me. I’d like to win but I’m just glad I had the chance to take part, as I love creative writing.”
David Sims, Key Stage 3 Progress Manager at Smith’s Wood Sports College, says: “My students were really excited about the possibility of winning an amazing prize like this, thanks so much to Everywhere Travel for such a brilliant opportunity. This competition both encouraged pupils to develop their literacy skills, their persuasive writing skills, and their imaginations, all with the potential of winning a life changing holiday”.
Finalist Kirsty says: “I’m really excited. It feels amazing to be representing the school in the competition and it’s a privilege to be chosen from the year group.” Her friend Rachel adds: “I’m proud of myself for entering in the first place and now having a chance to go up against other schools in this fun competition is brilliant.”

Public libraries will be joining in with a line-up of family events, including exclusive screenings of a brand new short film about a young William Shakespeare, produced especially for the Week and titled ‘Unwillingly to School’.
Here’s a flavor of what else is in store:

At the heart of the celebrations in Stratford-upon-Avon, help to create a Forest of Arden in the gardens of Anne Hathaway’s Cottage.
Embark on a trail around the galleries at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery to search for paintings of Shakespeare’s contemporaries.
Look out for some of Shakespeare’s best-loved characters as they live out their famous stories at Tudor House & Garden in Southampton.
Discover the world of the Tudors by taking part in costume and prop making activities at The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.
At Westminster Abbey, explore Shakespeare’s history plays in the place where two of Shakespeare’s kings are buried.
Watch a hilarious musical adaptation of Twelfth Night, performed by children from Overchurch Primary School at Cheshire’s Tatton Park.

"100,000 sign up to state “old school tie” networks – Education Today","['Careers', 'News']","March 2, 2015",https://www.education-today.co.uk/100000-sign-up-to-state-old-school-tie-networks/,"A 100,000 strong army of former state students is marching back to school giving state students across Britain access to the ‘old school tie’ networks favoured by many private schools.
From bankers to lawyers, plumbers to choreographers, ex-state school everyday heroes are boosting the career opportunities of the current generation at their old state school by acting as inspirational and relatable role models.
The initiative is run by the leading education charity Future First, the only organisation to set up alumni networks in the state sector. The scheme has been cited in government guidance as the sort of careers programme state schools should follow.
During National Careers Week from March 2nd to 6th, Future First alumni will be returning to their former state schools and colleges from the South West to the North East to motivate young people to career confidence and academic success.
Christine Gilbert, Executive Chair of Future First and a former Chief Inspector of Ofsted, said reaching 100,000 alumni sign- ups in just three years exceeded all expectations and showed how much schools need and value the expertise of former students already in careers who can support the current generation.
She added: “Schools across Britain know that alumni are crucial in promoting student motivation because they provide relatable role models. If students see that someone who comes from the same background, perhaps had the same teachers has gone onto achieve a fulfilling and satisfying job, they are more likely to believe they can too. Private schools have harnessed the talent of alumni for generations and now state schools students have that same valuable opportunity.”
Warden Park Academy in Cuckfield, Haywards Heath, West Sussex, has more than 300 former students signed up to its Future First alumni network.  Headteacher Jonathon Morris said, “Warden Park Academy has always valued and used its former students and our work with Future First has taken this to a new level.  The network has enabled us to target and select specific alumni for specific needs in order to generate the maximum benefit for our current students.
“One of our biggest successes achieved through our Future First network was a dyslexic former student who is now a successful local architect speaking to our students with special educational needs  about overcoming adversity, which generated lots of positive feedback from the students involved.
“Most recently we are appointing e-mentors to allow current students to ask questions of people in the jobs they’d like to do.”
Future First works in more than 400 schools enabling the schools to harness the talents of former students as work experience providers, mentors and career and education role models and as governors, fundraisers and donors.

As part of this new relationship, Discovery Education will provide a five-year, customised programme of professional development that will support the teaching staff in developing consistent and effective instructional practices using digital content and technology to maximise engaging and relevant learning experiences for students. Over the course of the five year programme, staff will actively develop and hone their skills and techniques in effectively using digital resources and proven pedagogical strategies to enhance student learning. Consisting of workshops, training days and feedback sessions, the programme is focused on bringing long term change throughout the school.
Some of the areas that teachers and management will be developing with Discovery Education include curriculum leadership and digital literacy, developing coding expertise, effectively introducing tablet devices to the classroom, and instructional support for teachers.
By working in partnership with Discovery Education, all teachers at Mission Grove will be supported by the Discovery Education Global Community. A network of education professionals that are passionate about transforming the learning experience with digital media, the Discovery Educator Global Community connects members around the world through social media, virtual conferences and in-person events — fostering valuable networking, idea-sharing and inspiration.

Land ahoy! Young engineers launch giant origami paper boat – Education Today,"['News', 'STEM']","January 16, 2015",https://www.education-today.co.uk/land-ahoy-young-engineers-launch-giant-origami-paper-boat/,"Pupils from Tottenham UTC helped to launch a giant-sized origami boat on Southwark Boating Lake in South London to mark the 50 day countdown to the annual The Big Bang Fair, which promotes careers in STEM subjects to young people.
The boat, capable of carrying an adult safely, was 3.6 metres (almost 12 foot) long. Almost 100 metres of paper were used to make the boat – that’s the length of a football field.
The Big Bang Fair invited Morwenna Wilson, a direct descendent of Isambard Kingdom Brunel who is herself an award-winning engineer, to captain the boat on its maiden voyage.
Morwenna works for Argent in London as a mechanical engineer, and is currently leading several major projects at London King’s Cross Railway Station.
Morwenna Wilson said: “Engineering runs in my family, and I really want to show young people that this career can open doors to amazing opportunities and adventures. From creating a huge origami boat, constructing a new skyscraper, or designing an aeroplane, so many things we travel on, live in or use in our everyday lives involve engineering.”
A team of engineers worked on the project, and due to its vast size had to make certain modifications to the traditional paper boat model. To ensure that the boat was stable enough that it didn’t capsize when someone stepped on it, a keel made of wood was added underneath the boat.
For safety, a polystyrene block was also added into the supporting pyramid, and ridged paper in the base of the boat created a platform strong enough for someone to stand on.
The team also used a specialist paper which is stronger and more water-resistant. This was necessary as it was in the water for much longer than a standard small-scale paper boat.
Year 10 pupil Daniella Jennings, 15, from Tottenham UTC, London said: “It was cool to see how they managed to make a huge version of the kind of paper boats you can make at home. I didn’t even realise that was something engineers could do!”

Piping Championships are back with a twist – Education Today,"['Competition', 'Music, Stage & Drama', 'News']","December 18, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/piping-championships-are-back-with-a-twist/,"Young musicians are set to put the wind up Scotland’s bagpipe playing heritage.
Scotland’s top young pipers and drummers are starting to gear up for the world’s largest schools pipe band competition – which this year comes with a twist.
The Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships (SSPBC) features an innovative ‘Freestyle’ category which aims to show how traditional piping and drumming can be combined with other musical instruments to create a modern take on pipe music.
The event will see the musicians – with some swapping their pipes for a piano, guitar or even bongo drums, midway – perform tunes under the theme ‘anything goes’, ranging from Scottish melodies, songs from musicals and hits from One Direction.
David Johnston, Chairman of the SSPBC committee, said the Freestyle competition is unique in the world.
He said: “The Freestyle category is all about the traditional pipes and drums – but with a twist.
“It offers a chance for pipers and drummers to let loose from the rigid competition format to perform some more modern pieces in a relaxed atmosphere.
“We decided to introduce this category as a way of highlighting the versatility of the pipes and drums alongside other instruments which we think will encourage schools to get creative, as well as adding a quirky twist to the event.
“It means that schools can look to use their whole orchestras and young musicians to compete in a novel competition.
“This category is all about injecting some fun into the competition and showcasing the outstanding musical talent of our younger generation, regardless of what instrument they play.”
Already seven schools have entered for the 10 slots available in the Freestyle category, who will face a judging panel consisting of some of Scotland’s most senior Pipe Majors, as well as Craig Munro from Scottish piping favourites The Red Hot Chilli Pipers.
Elsewhere, entries are starting to flood in for the SSPBC which takes place on March 8 at Broughton High School and Fettes College in Edinburgh.
The deadline for entries closes on 26 January and the SSPBC committee is keen to encourage more schools to sign up.
Last year, more than 600 students from nearly 100 schools competed in the event which aims to showcase the need for Scottish schools to offer pupils the opportunity to play Scotland’s famous national instrument.
David added: “We want to prove to schools, education authorities and parents, that learning Scotland’s most iconic musical instrument can not only teach our kids important skills but it can build self confidence and can instil a sense of pride in younger generations.
“Year on year the numbers for the competition keep growing and we have seen everything from juniors to seniors from a wide and diverse range of schools take part.
“It’s a real thrill to see the level of interest amongst younger generations rise around an instrument that plays such a significant part in Scotland’s musical heritage.”

New Into Film CPD programme focuses on film to raise attainment – Education Today,"['CPD', 'Literacy', 'National Curriculum', 'News', 'Teaching resources']","December 10, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/new-into-film-cpd-programme-focuses-on-film-to-raise-attainment/,"How can teachers best use film as a text to improve literacy?   What are the benefits of filmmaking for young people and how can it be incorporated simply and practically into teaching and learning?  Educators across the UK can now expand their skills by taking part in an innovative and flexible new CPD programme from Into Film, an education charity supported by the BFI with Lottery Funding.  The programme will provide a range of strategies to develop literacy, filmmaking and employability skills, and raise attainment in reading and writing using the engaging and thought-provoking medium of film.
Developed in collaboration with a range of partners including the BFI, the Bradford Media Literacy Project, NI Creative Learning Centres and a wide variety of subject associations and CPD practitioners, the programme consists of two key strands: Literacy CPD designed to improve literacy through the use of film as text, and Filmmaking CPD designed to enhance curricular learning through the use of filmmaking.  Training is available free for groups of 15 participants or more, with sessions ranging in length from 30 minutes to a full day and tailored to meet the needs of individual schools.
Into Film’s Literacy CPD demonstrates the benefits of using film as text to develop learners’ critical thinking, analytical and contextualisaton skills – skills equally applicable to and transferable between film and literary texts.   Educators are introduced to the key concepts of colour, character, camera, story, setting and sound – the 3Cs and 3Ss – and how learners can use these to analyse and decode film and other texts.  Activities – designed to suit different age-groups –   include games and activities to develop identification and analysis of different camera shots, learning how to construct a story and use character analysis in scriptwriting, analysing use of sound, expressing thoughts and opinions on a piece of film and exploring mise-en-scene.
The Filmmaking Programme emphasises film as a teaching tool to encourage deep and active learning across a range of subjects and facilitates young people taking control of their own learning processes.   With a firm focus on filmmaking without specialist equipment, sessions range from Record and Playback, ShoeBox Set Design and Introduction to Animation, to 5,4,3,2,1 – a framework for simple filmmaking using tablets, flip cameras or smartphones.
Teachers already working with film have welcomed its positive impact.  In a recent survey  96% said their students were more engaged with the curriculum, 86% said their students were more imaginative and creative, 76% said their students had improved speaking and listening skills, 74% said their students had improved critical thinking and enquiry skills and 72% said their students had improved literacy skills.
According to Colm Hackett of Hazelwood Integrated College, “Using film to teach improve literacy promotes a more democratic and inclusive method of teaching. We, as teachers, have to meet the challenge of engaging all children. As they are already a visually literate generation this is the best way I have found to do so.”

Revolutionary school improvement programmes hit secondary schools – Education Today,"['KS3', 'Literacy', 'News', 'School Improvements', 'Secondary schools', 'Teaching resources']","November 4, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/revolutionary-school-improvement-programmes-hit-secondary-schools/,"Thanks to a £1m grant from The JJ Charitable Trust, The National Literacy Trust has today announced the launch of brand new school improvement programmes which take a revolutionary whole-school approach, aiming to improve secondary school attainment by changing school culture and embedding literacy throughout the curriculum.
The National Literacy Trust’s new set of programmes has been designed by the charity in response to the growing need for literacy support in secondary schools nationally:

A significantly lower proportion of children reach the expected level in their GCSEs than at the end of primary school (55.9% vs. 78% in 2014)
National Literacy Trust research shows that children’s attitudes to literacy become more negative when they reach secondary school.
Department for Education figures show that 52.6% of pupils in England gained five A*-C grades this year, down from the 59.2% last year.
Disadvantaged pupils were hit the hardest, with just 34% of pupils gaining five good GCSEs in deprived boroughs of the UK.

To address these issues, The JJ Charitable Trust has granted £1m over 3 years to the National Literacy Trust to implement the “Academies Programme” with the Aldridge Foundation and Ormiston Academies Trust academy chains. The Programme will provide a framework to improve literacy by working through five steps from diagnostic to leadership and skills assessment, and the approach will draw on community resources, families and students’ passions and interests.
The National Literacy Trust has also been commissioned by Oxfordshire County Council to work with a cluster of secondary schools over two years, as the “Oxfordshire Gaining Momentum Campaign”. The Campaign seeks to address the county’s above average gap in attainment between disadvantaged and other pupils, with a focus on students in Years 7 and 8.
Jonathan Douglas, Director of the National Literacy Trust says: “We are delighted to be launching our new school improvement programmes which will enable us to achieve our ambitious vision for secondary school improvement. Thanks to The JJ Charitable Trust and Oxfordshire County Council we will work with secondary schools to embed literacy as the driver for improving attainment at GCSE level.”
Mark Woodruff, Executive of The JJ Charitable Trust says: “Literacy is one of The JJ Charitable Trust’s main concerns and for years we have worked with charities to prevent and overcome poor access to literacy that too often sees children and young people fall prey to low educational attainment, low employment chances and even homelessness and prison.
“We have turned to the National Literacy Trust for a creative new approach to young people’s inclusion in literacy that gives them a powerful place at the heart of their own education. With schools able to provide bespoke literacy support they will be making the most of all that teachers and their skills, with young people’s families and peers have to offer.
“We are delighted to be working to develop this new capacity with National Literacy Trust, its extensive school networks, and their partners in the Aldridge Foundation and Ormiston Academies Trust groups of academies.”
Honor Wilson Fletcher of the Aldridge Foundation says: ”The National Literacy Trust is being really smart; understand how academies work as a whole and you have the chance to embed lasting, effective strategies for literacy in their DNA.  Aldridge Foundation is proud to be part of this ground-breaking national partnership.  Our schools have made huge progress in improving literacy outcomes for our students, but we always want to do more.  Out of a forest of initiatives, our Trustees and our academies have therefore seized on the opportunity to participate in this ambitious, strategic piece of research.”

The presenter returned to her former school, Haberdashers’ Aske’s Hatcham College in Pepys Road, New Cross, to talk to current students about her career path as statistics show the crucial importance of alumni in motivating state school students to success.
Fiona was accompanied by two school friends Susanna Frein, Communications Director at Harper Collins and Jo Lockwood, Picture Editor at Prima magazine (pictured).
Fiona told the sixth formers that qualifications would get them through the door into their chosen career but, once there, personality and building good working relationships were vital. She urged them to not be shy about putting forward their ideas and asking for opportunities.
Future First Managing Director Alex Shapland-Howes said, “Alumni are invaluable in helping state schools  support their students to make that difficult transition between school and work.
“Many schools are already doing this by using their alumni as inspirational relatable role models who know the background of the students, kicked a ball in the same park, may have had the same teachers. If students see people like them with the same background have succeeded, they are more likely to believe they can too.”

Back to school week highlights value of alumni in state school student success – Education Today,"['News', 'Skills']","October 14, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/back-to-school-week-highlights-value-of-alumni-in-state-school-student-success/,"A national campaign to inspire state students to fulfilment in the world of work launched yesterday as statistics show the crucial importance of alumni in motivating state school students to success.
Research by the leading education charity Future First shows some state schools don’t harness the valuable talents of alumni as relatable role models for the current generation in the way that many private schools and universities have done for generations.
The research comes as Future First launches Back to School Week between October 13th and 17th in state schools across the country during which celebrities and every day heroes – from doctors and lawyers to plumbers and caterers – will return to their former state school to talk to the current generation about their career paths and the skills necessary to succeed in work.
Future First believes alumni can and should play an invaluable role in working alongside teachers, employers and careers professionals in preparing students for the working world. The charity is the only organisation enabling state schools to utilise the experience of alumni as work experience providers, mentors and e-mentors, career and education role models and as governors, fundraisers and donors.
The YouGov/Future First statistics show that:
•             75 per cent of state students are motivated to work harder after hearing from alumni.
•             Only 3 per cent of state school graduates say that they hear from their old school at least once a year compared with 42 per cent of private school graduates.
•             75 per cent of state school graduates didn’t meet anyone who is working the sector in which they now work while they were at secondary school.
•             Only 18 per cent attended a careers event during secondary school featuring someone who worked in the same job or sector in which they now work.
Celebrities returning to their old state school as part of Back to School Week include:
BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce, who went back to her former school in South London on Monday October 13th to talk to sixth formers.
Former ITV weather presenter Sian Lloyd who will go back to her former school in Swansea on Wednesday October 15th.
Future First works in 10 per cent of British state secondary schools enabling those schools to utilise the talents of alumni to support current students. More than 90,000 people have registered with Future First to support their old school. Research shows ten million people are willing to do the same.
Future First Managing Director Alex Shapland-Howes said, “Alumni are invaluable in helping state schools  support their students to make that difficult transition between school and work.

Young people inspired to seek digital jobs but worry they will need new skills to be successful – Education Today,"['ICT', 'News', 'Research', 'Skills']","October 14, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/young-people-inspired-to-seek-digital-jobs-but-worry-they-will-need-new-skills-to-be-successful/,"Digital technology is creating new, more interesting job opportunities, according to an Accenture (NYSE: ACN) study, which surveyed 5,000+ UK residents from the age of 12+. However, the research found that student age respondents worry they may not be equipped with the relevant skills to make the most of those opportunities.
Asked what digital means to them from a personal and professional perspective, 75% of 12-17 year olds believe that digital technologies will give them more job opportunities than they would otherwise have had. Half say digital will help them get their “dream job”, while 67% also recognise they will be competing for new roles, such as data scientists that are being created as a result of all organisations using digital to re-imagine how they operate their business.
Although this age group are digitally literate and socially connected, they fear that their education isn’t providing them with the right skills for these new roles. Two thirds (65%) feel that the current curriculum is not developing or enhancing their digital skills adequately.
“It’s good news that young people feel optimistic about the opportunities digital offers, but the fact that they don’t feel they are being fully equipped is worrying. After all, they are the next generation of our workforce and the future of British business is in their hands,” said Nick Millman, managing director, Accenture Digital. “We know that jobs will look different in the future as a result of digital, and yet it seems that even the positive changes already made in classrooms and the curriculum such as the introduction of coding, still may not be enough. We need to give young people the confidence to contribute to organisations that want to become fundamentally digital.”
Digital inspires
While there is more to be done in the classroom, it is clear that people of all ages in the UK believe digital drives opportunities in the workplace. Half of those people surveyed said that digital will enable them to be more productive (51%), creative (48%) and more flexible, with 54% saying work will be able to happen irrespective of location.
Millman explains: “At the heart of this report is a desire to give businesses visibility of what is really going on in the world around them. Too few have fully embraced and adopted digital and it is crucial that they mirror the passion and energy felt so strongly by their next-generation workforce. It is only by carving out a digital strategy relevant to young people to become digital on the inside, that organisations can ensure they continue to succeed and shape the future.”
Use Digital to reinvent the workforce
Digital will transform the lives of younger generations. Parents believe digital will give children more opportunities than they would otherwise have had (74%) and that jobs will be enhanced (78%), which could be driven by advances in cognitive computing. Over half (56%) of all respondents agree that humans should instruct machines to do as much as possible, leaving humans to do more of the interesting and innovative roles.
“In order to realise the full potential of a workforce, businesses need to augment manual tasks, as well as automate the less creative ones,” Millman concludes. “The fact is, digital technologies have the ability to transform both personal and professional worlds, allowing all of us more flexibility and choice in the way we work, but crucially also more options about the tasks we are asked to perform. Organisations need to get better at presenting themselves as digital enablers, reassuring potential employees that their lives will be enhanced because the business has implemented technology appropriately.”",digital technology is creating new more interesting job opportunity according to an accenture nyse acn study which surveyed uk resident from the age of however the research found that student age respondent worry they may not be equipped with the relevant skill to make the most of those opportunity asked what digital mean to them from a personal and professional perspective of year old believe that digital technology will give them more job opportunity than they would otherwise have had half say digital will help them get their dream job while also recognise they will be competing for new role such a data scientist that are being created a a result of all organisation using digital to reimagine how they operate their business although this age group are digitally literate and socially connected they fear that their education isnt providing them with the right skill for these new role two third feel that the current curriculum is not developing or enhancing their digital skill adequately it good news that young people feel optimistic about the opportunity digital offer but the fact that they dont feel they are being fully equipped is worrying after all they are the next generation of our workforce and the future of british business is in their hand said nick millman managing director accenture digital we know that job will look different in the future a a result of digital and yet it seems that even the positive change already made in classroom and the curriculum such a the introduction of coding still may not be enough we need to give young people the confidence to contribute to organisation that want to become fundamentally digital digital inspires while there is more to be done in the classroom it is clear that people of all age in the uk believe digital drive opportunity in the workplace half of those people surveyed said that digital will enable them to be more productive creative and more flexible with saying work will be able to happen irrespective of location millman explains at the heart of this report is a desire to give business visibility of what is really going on in the world around them too few have fully embraced and adopted digital and it is crucial that they mirror the passion and energy felt so strongly by their nextgeneration workforce it is only by carving out a digital strategy relevant to young people to become digital on the inside that organisation can ensure they continue to succeed and shape the future use digital to reinvent the workforce digital will transform the life of younger generation parent believe digital will give child more opportunity than they would otherwise have had and that job will be enhanced which could be driven by advance in cognitive computing over half of all respondent agree that human should instruct machine to do a much a possible leaving human to do more of the interesting and innovative role in order to realise the full potential of a workforce business need to augment manual task a well a automate the le creative one millman concludes the fact is digital technology have the ability to transform both personal and professional world allowing all of u more flexibility and choice in the way we work but crucially also more option about the task we are asked to perform organisation need to get better at presenting themselves a digital enablers reassuring potential employee that their life will be enhanced because the business ha implemented technology appropriately,"['reinvent', 'job', 'new', 'employee', 'workplace', 'professional', 'student', 'scientist', 'nextgeneration', 'competing']"
Charity helps schools gear up for Big Yellow Friday – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News', 'Teaching resources']","October 9, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/charity-helps-schools-gear-up-for-big-yellow-friday/,"Big Yellow Friday, the national awareness and fundraising day for Children’s Liver Disease Foundation (CLDF) has proved increasingly popular with schools over the past couple of years. Now the charity has put together a special online toolkit to make it as easy as possible for schools to join in the fun and maximise their fundraising for next year’s event (Friday March 6 2015).
 
CLDF is the only national charity dedicated to fighting all childhood liver diseases and relies on community fundraising for the majority of its income. Big Yellow Friday sees individuals, groups, workplaces and schools around the country undertaking all kinds of yellow themed activity in order to raise much-needed funds. Since its launch in 2008, the event has raised over £450,000 for the charity. But with next year’s target set at £100,000, CLDF is keen for as many schools as possible to get involved.
 
 “Big Yellow Friday is a popular event for schools and colleges because it’s simple to organise – a Wear Something Yellow Day or yellow cake sale for example – and it supports a children’s charity,” said CLDF’s Head of Fundraising, Joanna Oldfield. “Sometimes a school decides to take part because one of their pupils has a liver disease but with senior schools in particular we find that pupils are often encouraged to take part in fundraising initiatives and prefer to support a smaller charity.
 
“The theme gives pupils the freedom to be as creative in their fundraising as they wish and the cause – supporting other young people affected by a serious long term health condition – is something we find pupils can relate to,” continues Joanna. “We want to make it as simple as possible for schools to join in.”
 
The Big Yellow Friday Schools Kit which includes promotional material, lesson resources, a presentation and a host of fundraising ideas is available at  http://www.bigyellowfriday.org/Ideas–materials/Download-or-order-materials/Schools-Kit-and-Materials.

"Techno innovation breaks barriers to education, says VSO – Education Today",['News'],"October 3, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/techno-innovation-breaks-barriers-to-education-says-vso/,"Innovations in technology are helping teachers to break barriers to education, says leading international development agency, Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) UK, as it marks World Teacher’s Day on October 5th.
 
VSO, a charity which aims to fight poverty through volunteers, has been working across Asia and Africa to monitor the positive impact that information technology, such as mobile phone apps and text messages, can have on improving the quality of education.
 
In Papua New Guinea, VSO found that 92% of teachers have access to mobile phones.
 
In partnership with the Department of Education and with funding from Australian Aid, VSO conducted an SMS Story research project to determine if daily mobile phone text-message stories and lesson plans would improve children’s reading in PNG’s primary schools.
 
According to Purna Shrestha, Global Research and Advocacy Advisor (Education) for VSO:
 
“Teachers in the participating schools received an explanatory poster and daily text messages for 100 days. Teachers in other schools – the control group – received no text messages. 
 
“By the end of the trial, the reading scores for children in the participating schools were far higher than for children in the control group. There was clear evidence that text messages that carried lesson plans and stories to teachers improve children’s reading ability significantly and change teaching practice in the classroom.”
 
Likewise, in Malawi, VSO partnered with app developer Onebillion, amongst others, to create an app to help teach Malawian school children maths.
 
Education in Malawi is often basic – classes of 90 pupils are normal and some children have to share one teacher with 300 classmates.
 
However, by using mobile tablet technology in the classroom, it allows for highly tailored and interactive learning, which can improve the quality of basic education for primary school age children, especially girls, in Malawi.
 
Researchers at Nottingham University tested the Onebillion app against other teaching apps, as well as no apps, in a randomised control trial. They found that it helped to greatly boost children’s maths knowledge compared to the other options.
 
“It is essential we continue to invest in education and ensure teachers are equipped with the right resources to do their job whether that’s via technology or not,” says Purna. “It’s distressing that the investment needed to improve the quality of teaching and learning hasn’t been prioritised in the development and implementation of national education sector plans.”
 
“VSO is committed to ensuring that improvements in pupils’ learning outcomes are possible when teachers are well-trained and effective in helping their pupils learn, through a combination of volunteers, technology and research.”

Firs School pupil qualifies for Grand Final of the Junior Language Challenge – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'KS3', 'Modern languages', 'News']","October 3, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/firs-school-pupil-qualifies-for-grand-final-of-the-junior-language-challenge/,"A Cheshire school pupil has qualified for the Grand Final of the national Junior Language Challenge, which will take place at the Language Show in London on Friday 18 October 2014.
Jennifer Stairmand attends The Firs School in Chester and began the language challenge by learning Italian online, followed by Japanese over the summer. Jennifer, a Year 6 pupil, has been rewarded for her dedication and hard work with a place in the prestigious grand final in London.
She is currently learning Somali online to add to her language skills in time for next month’s final. Her elder sister, Anne, a former student of The Firs, also qualified for the final in 2009 and 2010. Many pupils from The Firs School have taken part in the language challenge since it began 10 years ago, with considerable success, including 21 semi-finalists and 5 finalists.
The  Junior Language Challenge is an annual competition for primary school age children across the UK. It aims to encourage under-elevens to learn new languages, including those not traditionally covered in the classroom. Children learn online and master basic vocabulary and phrases, and use their knowledge to play games and score points. The highest scorers from each region in the first round went on to take part in the semi-final, which took place this year at Smallwood School in Sandbach on Thursday 18th September.
Headteacher, Mrs Lucy Davies says;
“Hambalyo, or congratulations in Somali to Jennifer on qualifying for the Grand Final. The challenge is a great motivator to get young people to learn new languages and at the same time support schools in Malawi to help improve the provision of basic education for their pupils.”
The entry fee of £5 per child to enter the Junior Language Challenge is donated to  onebillion, a charity working with some of the world’s most disadvantaged children, to provide tablet devices to schools in Malawi. Classes can have well over 100 pupils with a single teacher.

English project responds to needs of teachers of young EAL learners in UK schools – Education Today,"['News', 'Primary schools', 'Teaching resources']","October 2, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/english-project-responds-to-needs-of-teachers-of-young-eal-learners-in-uk-schools/,"A new English project is supporting the needs of teachers to develop skills for teaching young learners with English as an additional language (EAL) in UK schools.
The EAL Nexus project, funded by the European Integration Fund, the British Council and The Bell Foundation, has launched a new website to support teachers in their preparation for educating EAL learners.
The dedicated site is the first of its kind for UK teachers and contains an accessible database of materials to help teach EAL learners. The materials follow the different school curricula across the UK and come with comprehensive notes for teachers to ensure EAL learners in mainstream education are better supported.
With over one million EAL learners in UK schools, research carried out for the government in 2013 revealed that teaching these students is the area of work newly qualified teachers say they feel least equipped for. The project aims to directly tackle that issue by engaging with learners and teachers on the EAL Nexus site, as well as through a series of workshops and seminars. The seminar series is being developed in collaboration with The Bell Foundation and the National Association for Language Development in the Curriculum (NALDIC).
Melanie Griffin, EAL Nexus Co-ordinator for Teacher Development at the British Council, said: “With over one million EAL learners in UK schools, it is important that projects like EAL Nexus are in place to ensure these learners and their teachers are well supported.
“It is fantastic to be sharing our expertise in English Language Teaching to bring this programme to EAL learners and their teachers across the UK. Our hope is that in creating quality online teaching materials and providing support through the wider EAL Nexus project, teachers across the country will feel better prepared to teach EAL learners in their classrooms. Not only should the project allow us to make strong progress in developing the UK’s EAL sector but will also help ensure that EAL learners feel included within the educational setting and wider community.”
Diana Sutton, Director of The Bell Foundation, said “We are delighted to be a funder of this project.  Having a one stop shop for EAL learners and teachers is an important step forward making it easier for good practice to be shared between schools and communities.”
The materials available on the EAL Nexus website are expected to reach further than the teachers and young EAL learners, with parents and members of migrant communities also being encouraged to sign up to the website or join the mailing list. The website includes a section for parents with information on the UK education systems and how to support their children through school in the UK.
The project will also work closely with teachers and other school staff in 24 pilot schools across the UK to improve understanding of the needs of EAL teaching and improve school provisions for EAL learners. This includes EAL teaching toolkits and modules of teacher development being produced for schools and a series of workshops for teachers on best practice for educating EAL learners.

Online points-based system ensures behaviour policy focuses on positivity – Education Today,"['News', 'Reward & Recognition']","October 2, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/online-points-based-system-ensures-behaviour-policy-focuses-on-positivity/,"Recently, Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, said that “leadership is absolutely critical” in improving behaviour.
Thinking alike, and working with Contact Group, providers of best in class communication and data services, former assistant head and director of Sixth Domain, John Roberts has created a new solution that allows teachers to track events – like good news, bad news, sanctions, reports, comments – and to monitor and analyse the behaviour of individual students, classes, forms and even houses. Improvement can be monitored on a week-by-week basis and news and follow up information saved and referred to other teachers.
Senior Leadership Teams can print off reports and analyse whole school and departmental behaviour, track homework and reports and communicate with parents.
Designed to integrate with a school’s Management Information System (MIS) and significantly reduce administration, Reward System employs the very latest SSL encryption technology to protect school data.
“Reward System has been particularly well received by schools,” said Stephen Clarke, Managing Director, Contact Group.  “Little Lever School in Bolton commented that it enables pastoral leaders to monitor very effectively students’ successes and areas for development.  Other schools reported a serious reduction in incidents of racism and bullying as a result of more rigorous reporting.
“As a provider of best in class communication and data services to the public sector, we are always looking for new products to enhance our existing portfolio.  We currently offer a range of solutions to cover parental communication, school attendance, looked after children, anti-bullying systems, registration apps, term time holiday tracking, mentoring and personalised apps.  Sixth Domain’s behaviour tracking and reward system sits perfectly with our product line.”

Rugby great Gareth Thomas puts his weight behind Anti-Bullying Week – Education Today,"['News', 'Primary schools', 'Secondary schools', 'Sport & Play']","October 2, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/rugby-great-gareth-thomas-puts-his-weight-behind-anti-bullying-week/,"Gareth Thomas, the 100-times capped former Wales skipper, has announced his support for this year’s Anti-Bullying Week, organised by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, which takes place on 17-21 November.
Gareth, who leads the Balls to Bullying campaign which launched earlier this year, visits schools all over the country to work with pupils on building resilience and boosting self-confidence.
Gareth has recently spoken of how his own schools days were blighted by bullying:
“I was picked on by my rugby teammates. When we went swimming, they would smack me with their wet towels. I got spat on, too. It was degrading, but I didn’t want to tell anyone because these were my rugby mates and I wanted to be in the team.
“I’m not sure why it happened, I wasn’t small or weak. I think it was because I didn’t stand up for myself. It started with a little thing – I was probably singled out because my rugby boots weren’t the best – and then it built. Going to school eventually became a nightmare.”
He added: ‘I’m so thrilled to be playing a part in Anti-Bullying Week, working alongside brilliant organisations which, like Balls to Bullying, are determined to stop bullying for all.’
Lauren Seager-Smith, National Coordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said: ‘ Ultimately, bullying is a behaviour choice, one which parents, carers, teachers and the community must work together to change at grass roots level; educating that bullying in any form is wrong, and that any environment that encourages bullying, or shows indifference to prejudice and discrimination is unacceptable. Gareth is a wonderful advocate for anti-bullying work so we’re delighted to see his involvement in Anti-Bullying Week to help all children and young people to take the lead on changing behaviour and to stop bullying for all.”
Rob Grays, managing director of Prospero Teaching, the company behind Balls to Bullying, said:
‘Balls to Bullying is having a real impact as Gareth travels round the country visiting schools and working with hundreds of children. When a sports legend stands up and says he’s been bullied, children and young people really listen. We’re delighted that Gareth will be a part of Anti-Bullying Week, which does so much to keep the scourge of bullying high on the national agenda.’

The Giant Walking Bus, which took place on June 11th, saw over 50,000 children across the UK march for road safety in an event designed to promote safe driving to parents and local communities. With a number of schools expected to carry out their Giant Walking Bus activity during Road Safety Week (17-23 November), the final number of participating children is expected to exceed 70,000.
Equipped with high-vis vests, posters, banners and the loud voices of thousands of children, schools across the nation took part in a 500m safe walk around the roads surrounding the school, creating an eye-catching giant human bus. 
Participating schools were also encouraged to fundraise for Brake and as a result have raised a staggering £20,500, with more money expected to be donated following the events in November.
Once all the fundraising activity is complete, Brake estimate that total donation money will come in at almost £35,000, money which will maintain Brake’s lifesaving campaigns for safer roads and their vital work in supporting families bereaved and injured in road crashes.
Rich Evans, campaign spokesperson for road safety at webuyanycar.com comments: 
“We take our responsibility as the UK’s biggest online car buying service very seriously and are dedicated to doing all we can to protect the most vulnerable road users. Raising funds and awareness go hand-in-hand and we are proud that our work enabled us to communicate a GO 20 message to local communities while enabling Brake’s vital work to continue.”
Katie Shephard, fundraising and engagement director of Brake, comments: “The Giant Walking Bus is one of the most fun pieces of activity we organise so it was great to partner with an organisation who shares our values and aims. We’re pleased with the results and the money will be well invested in helping to protect children on the roads.”",brake the road safety charity and have raised more than through the joint initiative giant walking bus these fund will be directly invested by the charity into future campaign designed to make the road safer for the uk most vulnerable user and used to support their work with family and individual devastated by road crash the giant walking bus which took place on june th saw over child across the uk march for road safety in an event designed to promote safe driving to parent and local community with a number of school expected to carry out their giant walking bus activity during road safety week november the final number of participating child is expected to exceed equipped with highvis vest poster banner and the loud voice of thousand of child school across the nation took part in a m safe walk around the road surrounding the school creating an eyecatching giant human bus participating school were also encouraged to fundraise for brake and a a result have raised a staggering with more money expected to be donated following the event in november once all the fundraising activity is complete brake estimate that total donation money will come in at almost money which will maintain brake lifesaving campaign for safer road and their vital work in supporting family bereaved and injured in road crash rich evans campaign spokesperson for road safety at comment we take our responsibility a the uk biggest online car buying service very seriously and are dedicated to doing all we can to protect the most vulnerable road user raising fund and awareness go handinhand and we are proud that our work enabled u to communicate a go message to local community while enabling brake vital work to continue katie shephard fundraising and engagement director of brake comment the giant walking bus is one of the most fun piece of activity we organise so it wa great to partner with an organisation who share our value and aim were pleased with the result and the money will be well invested in helping to protect child on the road,"['spokesperson', 'fundraise', 'lifesaving', 'march', 'donated', 'donation', 'bus', 'june', 'fundraising', 'charity']"
RAF Association launches High Values for children – Education Today,"['KS2', 'KS3', 'News', 'Teaching resources']","September 17, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/raf-association-launches-high-values-for-children/,"The RAF Association, in association with National Schools Partnership, is launching High Values, a free educational programme aimed at children aged 7-12.
High Values will present teachers with the opportunity to teach their pupils about four core values that are crucial to the RAF and the RAF Association: Respect, Integrity, Service and Excellence (RISE). The RISE values will be used as the principle ethos for how servicemen and servicewomen lead their lives. High Values will encourage UK pupils to understand the importance of these values and how they translate to everyday life.
Pupils will be taught about RISE using four supporting films, featuring current and ex-servicemen and women. These films will be available online and on a DVD that teachers will receive as part of their free resource pack when they register.
By the end of the programme, each pupil will make a pledge on the High Values website to demonstrate which value they will embrace and live by at home, at school and in their community.
The programme is open to all pupils aged 7-12 across the UK, so if you know someone who you think would enjoy learning about these High Values, encourage them to speak to their teachers.
All participating schools have the opportunity to request a visit from a current or ex-serving serviceman or woman, where available. They will be fully briefed before the decision to visit is agreed. The request must be submitted during the start and end dates of the programme which will be between September and December 2014.
The programme will inspire over 170,000 pupils across UK schools and expose them to RAF and RAF Association branding and values. This will prompt a greater understanding in becoming advocates for fundraising and support in their communities in the future.
The pupils will also be placed into a prize draw to win RAF Association merchandise or even an exciting RAF experience for their class.

Schools to celebrate Fairtrade’s 20th birthday this autumn – Education Today,"['Catering & Nutrition', 'Educational event', 'Environmental Focus', 'News', 'Primary schools', 'Teaching resources']","September 12, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/schools-to-celebrate-fairtrades-20th-birthday-this-autumn/,"Thousands of children in primary schools will be hosting the UK’s first Fairtrade Bakesale Party, to celebrate Fairtrade’s 20th birthday this autumn.
The campaign has been launched by the Fairtrade Foundation, and aims to help children learn about global issues whilst raising money to increase the impact of Fairtrade.
Using fun, interactive activities, the campaign helps develop understanding about Fairtrade and how it can help tackle poverty in developing countries.
2014 marks 20 years since the very first products carrying the FAIRTRADE Mark were sold in the UK. Now there are over 4,500 different items sold in the UK bearing the logo.
Thanks to the support of the public and campaigners, an increasing number of farmers and workers in developing countries are now selling their products on Fairtrade terms, bringing them a stable income, and the chance to work their own way out of poverty.
Kate Jones, Education Campaigns Manager, said: “Since the launch of the FAIRTRADE mark in 1994, more than 1.4 million farmers and workers have secured a better deal for their work, and improved the livelihood for their families.
“The Fairtrade Bakesale Party is a brilliant way to introduce pupils to Fairtrade and the people who grow some of the foods we eat every day. With our world map poster and worksheets, pupils will learn new skills and have great fun along the way, but most importantly taking part will empower them to make a difference to the lives of marginalised people in poorer countries.
“We hope schools across the UK will join us to celebrate Fairtrade’s 20th birthday and help bring Fairtrade to more of the people who need it most.”
In developing countries many of those who grow the products we consume in the UK earn less than it costs to run their farm. Raising money for the Fairtrade Foundation will help farmers to earn a fair price for their work, as well as a little extra – the Fairtrade Premium – which is invested for instance in clean drinking water, healthcare and education for children in the community.
Schools have been a big part of the Fairtrade movement. The Bakesale Party could be a first step towards achieving one of the nationally recognised Fairtrade School Awards, designed to teach the next generation that through everyday actions they have the power to change the world around them. There are now over 1,300 Fairtrade Schools in the UK, and that number continues to rise thanks to the support of dedicated teachers and students across the UK.

Former state school pupils urged to stand as governors – Education Today,"['News', 'School governance']","September 10, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/former-state-student-pupils-urged-to-stand-as-governors/,"The leading education charity Future First is calling on former state school students to sign up as governors at their old school amid increasing concern at the national shortage of adults volunteering to take up the posts.
Up to a quarter of school governor positions are vacant in some rural and deprived areas of England and one in 10 of the 300,000 governor posts nationally is unfilled.
Future First, which sets up alumni networks in more than 375 state schools and colleges across Britain, is now partnering with the charity SGOSS, which recruits volunteers to serve on school governing bodies across England, to encourage more ex-state school students to support their old school by volunteering to join the governing body. More than 90,000 people have registered with Future First to stay connected with their former school and some are already volunteering as governors.
Figures revealing the shortage of governors come at a time when pressure on governors to hold schools to account for their performance is growing.
Alex Shapland-Howes, Managing Director of Future First, said former students had a valuable role to play in shaping a school’s future as they were relatable role models for students.
“They know the school, they know the area and what the lives of the current students are like,”  said Mr Shapland-Howes. “They can play an incredibly important role in setting the direction of a school, supporting and challenging the head teacher, and ensuring money is well spent. For those former students looking for a way to make a difference in their local community, we would urge them to sign up and stand as governors.”
Anyone over 18 and living in the UK can be a governor. Governors do not manage the schools day to day business but oversee its long term future by supporting the teaching staff and championing success, helping to set the schools aims and objectives and monitoring progress, allocating the budget and appointing senior staff like the Headteacher.
Any former student wanting to find out more about being a governor should contact their former school or info@futurefirst.org.uk

Based on extensive research amongst 3,000 people aged 14 to 50, a person’s Cooking Age is a benchmarks their food knowledge and cooking skills against the National Curriculum.
The research reveals that as a nation, our Cooking Age is falling short of our real age, and we are reaching it much later than we should.  Just this week, practical cooking became a compulsory part of the National Curriculum for children up to the age of Year 9 for the first time in England – the government’s biggest ever nationwide push to get kids cooking and eating well.
Other key findings include

–          44% of 17 to 18 year olds admit they are unable to make time saving, nutritious dishes like an omelette from scratch.
Sainsbury’s is releasing the findings as it sets out plans to inspire a new generation of children to eat well through its Active Kids scheme, which is 10 years old next year.  With 51,000 nurseries, primary schools, secondary schools registered, Sainsbury’s will help teachers deliver these new lessons at classroom level to help boost the national Cooking Age through new curriculum-linked resources and an ambitious new nationwide schools competition.

The Sun and stars align to improve child literacy – Education Today,"['KS1', 'KS2', 'Literacy', 'News', 'Teaching resources']","September 8, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/the-sun-and-stars-align-to-improve-child-literacy/,"Britain’s biggest newspaper has teamed up with some of the most popular children’s authors and entertainers to introduce a new weekly feature encouraging parents to read with their children.


Specially written ten-minute stories from authors including David Walliams (Mr Stink), former children¹s laureate Michael Morpurgo (War Horse) and Jeff Kinney (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) will be published in the Saturday editions of The Sun.


The Get Kids Reading campaign from The Sun is part of a wider Read On, Get On campaign with Save the Children that calls on the government, local organisations and parents to tackle illiteracy and get children reading. The campaign aims to raise literacy levels so every child born this year can read well by the time they are 11 in 2025.


A Save The Children-led report reveals that Britain currently has one of the biggest literacy problems in Europe with one in six adults not being able to read to the standard set for 11-year olds. The cost of illiteracy to the economy is currently an estimated £18billion a year. By 2025 that could well have risen to an annual £43billion.


David Dinsmore, Editor of The Sun, said: “Illiteracy in Britain should be something our schoolchildren know only from the pages of their history books. Getting kids to read about things they’re interested in is half the battle. With exclusive stories by top children’s authors and free e-book offers, we will be helping parents find ways to make reading an easy everyday part of life.”


Justin Forsyth from Save The Children said: “We want every child to be given a fair and equal chance to learn to read well. We applaud The Sun for getting behind this campaign, and look forward to working with its readers to restore literacy to its rightful levels in the UK.”


Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: “I wholeheartedly endorse this campaign. Eradicating illiteracy and innumeracy is central to our plan for education.”


David Walliams said: “This country is falling behind in literacy levels so it’s so important for children to get help. Reading shouldn’t be a chore. It’s a lovely connection you can have with your children both painting the picture in your heads.”


Other contributors who have supplied ten-minute reads are Derek Landy (Skulduggery Pleasant), Susanna Reid, Rizzle Kicks and David Baddiel. The newspaper is also running a national competition to find the next budding children’s author with the winning story published as the final instalment of the series.

Last Post: The Postal Service in the First World War, explores the role of the General Post Office (GPO) on the home and fighting fronts and reveals the fascinating human stories of the postal service.
Over 75,000 men from the GPO fought in the First World War, including 12,000 in the Post Office Rifles, the GPO’s own battalion. On the Home Front the GPO became one of the largest employers of women when over 33,000 women took over the jobs left by men.
During the First World War, the GPO controlled Britain’s postal, telegraph and telephone services. Letters from home were essential to the morale of soldiers on the Front Line. At the height of the war 12.5 million letters a week reached the Front from Britain, many in as little as two days.
In Last Post, war time characters guide pupils through different topics that tell the story of the essential role of the GPO in the First World War. Pupils will use real archival documents, photographs, maps and museum objects to discover how the postal service went to war.
Cross-curricular activities include how to make a Morse code transmitter, how to send a secret message by pigeon post and how to search the Royal Mail war memorials database to learn about the impact of the war in your area.
The free resource includes lesson plans, teacher’s notes, PowerPoints for whiteboards, image galleries and over 100 activity ideas.
Royal Mail’s Head of Corporate Responsibility and Community Investment Lily Heinemann commented that “Royal Mail is pleased to have worked with the BPMA and sponsor this new learning resource as part of its programme to commemorate the First World War. It reveals the important, fascinating and under-told story about the role the postal service played in the war to teachers and students across the UK”.
“The cross-curricular nature of the Last Post pack allows students to learn about the impact of the First World War in all their core subjects” said Sally Sculthorpe, Learning Officer at the BPMA.
“This is just one of the many captivating stories we’ll be sharing at The Postal Museum, a new national museum opening in Central London in 2016 exploring Britain’s extraordinary social and communications history.”

Groundbreaking project sees Myanmar welcome foreign teacher trainers – Education Today,['News'],"August 21, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/groundbreaking-project-sees-myanmar-welcome-foreign-teacher-trainers/,"Leading international development charity Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) is sending volunteer teacher trainers to Myanmar throughout August and September, marking a historic moment between Myanmar and the UK.
The initiative is being undertaken in partnership with the British Council, as part of a British Council -DFID funded project, to help improve the quality of education in the country. The programme will be officially opened by The British Ambassador to Myanmar and Jim Emerson, CEO of VSO International, on the 25th August.
This is the first time foreigners have been permitted to work in the education colleges and the first time teacher educators will receive in-depth training. This involves two years of in-service teaching training for the teacher educators in the education colleges. The first year focuses on English language teaching and the second on methodology.
1,300 local teacher trainers will be taught by 44 expert English language teachers, who will be placed in the country’s Education Colleges and universities of Education. There will be VSO teacher trainers in almost every college in the country.
Alice Redfearn will be one of these VSO volunteer teacher trainers and she will be travelling to Myanmar on 19 August. Alice says:
“We will be working with teacher trainer colleagues in Myanmar colleges to help them enhance their English language skills.  This is an exciting opportunity to develop relationships and skills which will enable Myanmar professionals to have the knowledge and confidence to teach their children and young people English to a high standard.  They will also be able to use the internet to access research, teaching materials and methodology to take advantage of the wealth of information that is available in the English language.”
Education in Myanmar has suffered under decades of military rule.  The education sector has been chronically underfunded, leading to systemic weaknesses across the board. At present the state education system does not provide universal coverage, with monastic schools and ethnic education providers contributing to a patchwork system of provision. Capacity building is now required at every level, from nursery through to university.
The Government of Myanmar is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the education system and VSO and the British Council are supporting the process of educational reform through sending skilled teacher trainers who will work with the country’s teacher training institutions. VSO is experienced in supporting national governments to address challenges. VSO has volunteers supporting Education Ministries around the world in subjects such as school leadership, teacher training, and curriculum development.
Jim Emerson, CEO of VSO International says,
“By improving the skills of teacher educators, we will improve the training to all state school teachers across the country. The project hopes to have a profound impact upon the way in which teachers – and therefore children – are taught. By improving the education of children – we are investing in the country’s future.”",leading international development charity voluntary service overseas vso is sending volunteer teacher trainer to myanmar throughout august and september marking a historic moment between myanmar and the uk the initiative is being undertaken in partnership with the british council a part of a british council dfid funded project to help improve the quality of education in the country the programme will be officially opened by the british ambassador to myanmar and jim emerson ceo of vso international on the th august this is the first time foreigner have been permitted to work in the education college and the first time teacher educator will receive indepth training this involves two year of inservice teaching training for the teacher educator in the education college the first year focus on english language teaching and the second on methodology local teacher trainer will be taught by expert english language teacher who will be placed in the country education college and university of education there will be vso teacher trainer in almost every college in the country alice redfearn will be one of these vso volunteer teacher trainer and she will be travelling to myanmar on august alice say we will be working with teacher trainer colleague in myanmar college to help them enhance their english language skill this is an exciting opportunity to develop relationship and skill which will enable myanmar professional to have the knowledge and confidence to teach their child and young people english to a high standard they will also be able to use the internet to access research teaching material and methodology to take advantage of the wealth of information that is available in the english language education in myanmar ha suffered under decade of military rule the education sector ha been chronically underfunded leading to systemic weakness across the board at present the state education system doe not provide universal coverage with monastic school and ethnic education provider contributing to a patchwork system of provision capacity building is now required at every level from nursery through to university the government of myanmar is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the education system and vso and the british council are supporting the process of educational reform through sending skilled teacher trainer who will work with the country teacher training institution vso is experienced in supporting national government to address challenge vso ha volunteer supporting education ministry around the world in subject such a school leadership teacher training and curriculum development jim emerson ceo of vso international say by improving the skill of teacher educator we will improve the training to all state school teacher across the country the project hope to have a profound impact upon the way in which teacher and therefore child are taught by improving the education of child we are investing in the country future,"['emerson', 'professional', 'trainer', 'educator', 'august', 'charity', 'teacher', 'myanmar', 'ceo', 'volunteer']"
Nine thousand children set to enjoy Glyndebourne Performances for Schools this autumn – Education Today,"['Music, Stage & Drama', 'News']","August 20, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/nine-thousand-children-set-to-enjoy-glyndebourne-performances-for-schools-this-autumn/,"Nine thousand children will experience the exhilaration of watching fully-staged opera this autumn thanks to Performances for Schools on the 2014 Glyndebourne Tour.
Glyndebourne Performances for Schools offer priority booking and reduced price tickets to schools to take their students to see an opera, often for the first time.  Since the initiative began in 2006, over 30,000 children have been able to experience top quality, live opera in their home towns.
Following a successful expansion of the programme last year, Performances for Schools will once again take place in sixof the eight Glyndebourne Tour locations – Glyndebourne, Stoke, Plymouth/Exeter, Milton Keynes, Norwich​and Canterbury.
As well as full-length performances of Verdi’s La traviata and Mozart’s La finta giardiniera for secondary school pupils, Glyndebourne has commissioned a brand new work for 7 to 10-year-olds. Five Deaths and a Happy Ending charts the history of the art form and was written by writer and cartoonist, Sarah Lenton.
It will première at The Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury before touring to The Stables in Milton Keynes, The Cygnet Theatre in ​Exeter and The Garage in ​Norwich.
Five Deaths and a Happy Ending writer, Sarah Lenton, said:
“Opera is about love, death and disaster. Something is always going wrong, yet everyone – on stage and off – has a wonderful time. This show, featuring three singers, five deaths, one happy ending and a dragon, tells children everything they need to know about the art form with a whistle stop journey down the centuries, taking in Monteverdi’s Orfeo, Mozart’s The Magic Flute and The Barber of Seville, Verdi’s The Force of Destiny and Wagner’s Siegfried. The aim of the piece is to familiarise children with the conventions of opera and demonstrate the power of music to convey powerful emotions. There’s plenty of scope for audience interaction too, in fact pupils will be called on to help make a rain storm!”
Opera is the only art form that has it all: music, movement, drama and design. To support teachers to make the most of the educational opportunities of a live opera experience, Glyndebourne provides pre-performance introductions and teaching resources to support learning before and after a performance.
Chris Reall, assistant head teacher at Rocklands Community Primary School in Norwich, attended a Performance for Schools in 2013 and described the learning opportunities offered:
“We took a party of 46 children aged between six and 11 to see Glyndebourne’s  Hänsel and Gretel in Norwich in 2013 and the performance had them enthralled. Sets were described as ‘awesome’, acting was ‘brilliant’.   Before the visit there was intensive cross-curricular work from discussions about different versions of the Brothers Grimm tale, to the creation of art work based on a particular scene from the story. We also listened to a version of the opera on CD.  This preparatory work was amply rewarded by the excited ripple of recognition that ran round the group when the children heard that music in the Glyndebourne production.”

Into Film Festival 2014 unleashes the power of film – Education Today,"['Educational event', 'News', 'School Trips', 'Teaching resources']","August 19, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/into-film-festival-2014-unleashes-the-power-of-film/,"For a school trip that’s educational, exciting, fun – and free – look no further than the Into Film Festival 2014, the world’s largest film festival for children and young people, taking place from to 4th to 21st November.  Harnessing the power of film to captivate young minds and bring learning to life, a packed programme will seek to creatively involve 300,000 5-19 year-olds from all backgrounds and corners of the UK in watching and making films, many for the first time. Highlights will include exclusive premieres and previews of new feature films, free screenings, workshops, special events and Q&A sessions with industry experts, accompanied by innovative teaching resources.
 
The event will build on the success of last year’s festival, which saw over 200,000 young people attending over 1,300 special screenings and events across the UK. Renamed as the Into Film Festival, this annual celebration of film and education is made possible by support from the BFI, Cinema First, a wide collaboration with UK cinema industry partners and our festival delivery partners National Schools Partnership.  Into Film is the film education programme for young people aged 5-19 across the UK funded by the BFI (British Film Institute) with National Lottery money.
 
Highlighting both the magic of cinema and the educational value of film, one of the festival’s key themes is the 25th Anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Included will be references to the Treaty — the right to a childhood (including protection from harm), the right to be educated, the right to be healthy, the right to be treated fairly and the right to be heard.  In addition the festival will incorporate screenings, events and resources linked to Anti-Bullying Week, Parliament Week, World War I/Remembrance Day, and other campaigns and calendar events taking place within its duration.
 
Following consultations with educators across all four nations, the Festival will have clear learning outcomes that tie in with the UK’s respective curricula, support education and personal development, as well as help to build a lifelong passion for film.  Subjects covered will include English, Maths, Science, Modern Foreign Languages, History, Geography and Music. Many of the titles screened will have multiple subject connections and additional links to the areas of PSHE, Citizenship, PE, ICT, DT, Art & Design and RE.  Curriculum linked teaching resources or informal film guides containing synopses, discussion questions and links to other related titles will be provided alongside most films screened, promoting traditional and visual literacy, and facilitating further exploration of the films and the themes within them. Representatives from organisations such as Oxfam, The BeatBullying Group, The Refugee Council and The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust will contextualise relevant screenings with introductions and Q&A sessions.  Discussions will also take place around issues such as film classification and copyright, with support from the British Board of Film Classification and other industry bodies.
 
With the aim of making the festival accessible to all young people including those in disadvantaged or remote areas — many of whom have never before visited a cinema — screenings will be held in over 500 cinemas across all the major chains, and a range of venues across the UK from the ICA in London and the Millennium Centre in Wales, to independent cinemas on the Shetland Islands and the Isle of Skye.  Autism friendly screenings and, for sensory-impaired attendees, subtitling and audio-description, will add to inclusivity.
 
Workshops will be on offer to enable young people to learn about different aspects of filmmaking from creative professionals.  Showcasing films made by young people will be an important element of the festival, with one or more youth made short films — selected by a team of young programmers — shown before every screening.
 
In a survey of last year’s festival, 92% of attending educators said they saw the broader educational benefits for their students and 71% said they were more likely to use film or cinema visits to support delivery of the curriculum.
 
The Into Film Festival 2014 will take place from 4-21 November.  Bookings will go live at the beginning of September.

Changes to the system but national results remain stable – Education Today,"['A levels', 'News']","August 14, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/changes-to-the-system-but-national-results-remain-stable/,"Provisional results for this year’s A level and AS qualifications have been published today by the Joint Council for QualificationsCIC.
Results remain relatively stable at a national level, with the proportion of A* grades awarded rising 0.6 percentage points to 8.2 per cent of all awards. There is a slight dip at A*-A of 0.3 percentage points to 26.0 per cent and at A*-B of 0.5 percentage points to 52.4 per cent.
These are the first set of results since A level and AS qualifications effectively became linear through the complete removal of the January series in England and its removal for AS in Wales and Northern Ireland (see point 5 in Notes to Editors). The changes could lead to variations within schools and colleges, depending on how they previously entered students for examinations. For example, if they traditionally used the January series for resits they may see greater volatility than schools who usually entered students in a linear fashion.
Nottingham High School pupils and staff celebrate a great set of results for the school
Students are increasingly choosing Facilitating Subjects, with entries rising in Biology, Chemistry and Physics by 2.0 per cent (combined); Mathematics 0.9 per cent; and Further Maths 1.5 per cent. English entries are down 4.6 per cent but greater decreases can be seen in non-Facilitating Subjects such as General Studies (down 24.3 per cent) and Political Studies (down 10.6 per cent).
Although French, German and Spanish all had fewer entries than last year (down 7.4, 0.1, and 0.6 per cent respectively), as a proportion of all UK entries there is stability. The proportion of candidates awarded A* in these modern foreign languages increased (0.1 percentage point in French, 0.7 percentage point in German; and 1 percentage point in Spanish).
Results for other Facilitating Subjects also remain relatively unchanged, with the majority increasing at A* but declining marginally at A*-A. For example, in Biology the percentage of awards receiving an A* increased 1.4 percentage points to 9.4 per cent, but at A*-A declined 0.8 percentage points to 27.5 per cent. There are several factors that could possibly be contributing to this pattern in results, such as teachers adopting new strategies in response to the removal of the January series; a slight shift towards Facilitating Subjects affecting outcomes at grade A; and as the A* continues to bed in it becomes more important for highly selective universities and as such provides a greater incentive for students.
AS
Results for AS qualifications remain stable with a 0.1 percentage point increase at A to 19.9 per cent and a 0.5 percentage point increase at A*-E to 88.8 per cent. The overall increases in AS entries may be due in part to there being no resit opportunity in January; however, the data does point to the EBacc, a GCSE performance measure introduced in 2010, having an impact on post 16 subject choices with increases in Geography, Spanish and History.
Extended Project
The Extended Project continues to be popular with students and universities with a significant increase in entries of 9.4 per cent from 2013. This builds on a 6.4 per cent increase in that year.
Commenting on the results, Michael Turner, Director General of the Joint Council for QualificationsCIC said:
“Although the system has undergone change, this year’s national results are very stable. As ever, students and teachers across the country have worked hard to achieve them and should be congratulated for their efforts and the fruits of their labours.
“It is possible that due to the removal of the January series some schools and colleges may experience volatility in their results, depending on how they have adapted to the changes. But it is important to remember that standards have been maintained and, despite the changes, are comparable with previous years.
“The increase in the number of students taking Spanish and some other EBacc subjects at AS will be welcomed by many and it will be interesting to see if these rises follow through to next year’s A levels.”",provisional result for this year a level and a qualification have been published today by the joint council for qualificationscic result remain relatively stable at a national level with the proportion of a grade awarded rising percentage point to per cent of all award there is a slight dip at aa of percentage point to per cent and at ab of percentage point to per cent these are the first set of result since a level and a qualification effectively became linear through the complete removal of the january series in england and it removal for a in wale and northern ireland see point in note to editor the change could lead to variation within school and college depending on how they previously entered student for examination for example if they traditionally used the january series for resits they may see greater volatility than school who usually entered student in a linear fashion nottingham high school pupil and staff celebrate a great set of result for the school student are increasingly choosing facilitating subject with entry rising in biology chemistry and physic by per cent combined mathematics per cent and further math per cent english entry are down per cent but greater decrease can be seen in nonfacilitating subject such a general study down per cent and political study down per cent although french german and spanish all had fewer entry than last year down and per cent respectively a a proportion of all uk entry there is stability the proportion of candidate awarded a in these modern foreign language increased percentage point in french percentage point in german and percentage point in spanish result for other facilitating subject also remain relatively unchanged with the majority increasing at a but declining marginally at aa for example in biology the percentage of award receiving an a increased percentage point to per cent but at aa declined percentage point to per cent there are several factor that could possibly be contributing to this pattern in result such a teacher adopting new strategy in response to the removal of the january series a slight shift towards facilitating subject affecting outcome at grade a and a the a continues to bed in it becomes more important for highly selective university and a such provides a greater incentive for student a result for a qualification remain stable with a percentage point increase at a to per cent and a percentage point increase at ae to per cent the overall increase in a entry may be due in part to there being no resit opportunity in january however the data doe point to the ebacc a gcse performance measure introduced in having an impact on post subject choice with increase in geography spanish and history extended project the extended project continues to be popular with student and university with a significant increase in entry of per cent from this build on a per cent increase in that year commenting on the result michael turner director general of the joint council for qualificationscic said although the system ha undergone change this year national result are very stable a ever student and teacher across the country have worked hard to achieve them and should be congratulated for their effort and the fruit of their labour it is possible that due to the removal of the january series some school and college may experience volatility in their result depending on how they have adapted to the change but it is important to remember that standard have been maintained and despite the change are comparable with previous year the increase in the number of student taking spanish and some other ebacc subject at a will be welcomed by many and it will be interesting to see if these rise follow through to next year a level,"['teacher', 'congratulated', 'grade', 'provisional', 'math', 'modern', 'new', 'year', 'today', 'january']"

Walworth Academy hosts first ever UK Girl Summit – Education Today,"['Health, Hygiene & Safety', 'News']","July 22, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/walworth-academy-hosts-first-ever-uk-girl-summit/,"Walworth Academy was today the chosen venue for the UK Government and UNICEF to host the first ever Girl Summit, committed to ending female genital mutilation (FGM) and child, early and forced marriage (CEFM) within a generation.
Speakers at the summit including the Home Secretary Theresa May and International Development Secretary Justine Greening, Malala Yousafzai, Tony Lake, Executive Director of UNICEF along with FGM campaigners, NGOs and activists from the developing world.
Walworth Academy, which is part of the ARK Schools network, has been hosting special assemblies to discuss FGM and related issues with their female students and what actions needs to be taken in the community and are planning further events for all students. The school has also shared vital information about these issues with parents and carers to ensure they are fully informed.
Walworth Academy Principal Yvonne Powell told the summit: 
“We are all the leaders of young people and we should always aim to model the right behaviours. Our behaviours and actions will create tomorrow’s behaviour; behaviour is not born but it is learned. The challenge in removing FGM and forced marriage is to work with others to help them modify such behaviours and customs.”
Child, early and forced marriage affects millions of girls every year. One in three girls in developing countries is married by the age of 18.

Childnet announce the winners of Childnet Film Competition 2014 – Education Today,"['Competition', 'News']","July 21, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/childnet-announce-the-winners-of-childnet-film-competition-2014/,"Our Lady of the Rosary Primary School & Sandbach High School and Sixth Form College were announced as the winners of the fifth annual Childnet Film Competition at a private screening held at the BFI Southbank in London on 14th July. 
Attending the screening along with industry guests such as Facebook, the BBC, Twitter and Disney, children’s Minister Edward Timpson congratulated all the shortlist on their digital creativity.
The Childnet Film Competition, which was founded in 2010 as a way of asking young people to focus on positive use of the internet, invited schools and youth organisations from across the UK to create short, inspiring films using this year’s Safer Internet Day theme ‘Let’s create a better internet together’.  
Six schools were shortlisted to join the finalist’s event where there films were shown on the big screen and judged by a panel of experts from the BBFC, BFI, Trend Micro and the BBC.  Commending the creativity and quality of the 6 finalist’s films Childnet Education Manager, Caroline Hurst said: “This year’s film competition was the biggest yet so all 6 finalists should be proud to have made it to the final.  Choosing who should be awarded the top prize is always a challenge so I’d like to thank our judges for their time, expertise and dedication.  It was a great celebration of the positive uses of the internet and we hope that the participating schools and others will continue to use these resources to help educate others about staying safe online”   
Taking home the top prize of £500 was the Our Lady of the Rosary Primary School’s winning primary school entry ‘Making the internet a better place’and Sandbach High School and Sixth Form College winning secondary school entry‘what does a perfect online world mean to you’.  
Stephen Moon from Our Lady of the Rosary Primary School said:
“When Our Lady of the Rosary first learnt about the Childnet e-safety competition, there were no shortage of children keen to be involved in what promised to be an exciting activity. Taking part gave the children a defined goal to aim for and the ability to better understand the needs for vigilance online. In addition, they picked up skills in planning, filming and editing the final entry which are not only valuable, but things they can take forward into other projects at home and school.
Winning the competition has been such a boost for the school and the children involved…This has turned what was easily a very rewarding experience, into something much more enriching and far-reaching.”
Janet Scott from Sandbach High School and Sixth Form College said:
“The competition was promoted to all year groups and interested parties were invited to a launch meeting.  At this point all teacher input stopped and the teams went on their way.  They developed their own concepts and storyboards, filmed, edited and added soundtracks in their own time, only coming back to the teacher when they were happy with the end result.  They enjoyed the opportunity to create something focussed and demonstrate their knowledge of the topic as well as showcasing their technical skills.  As a school we have encouraged students to be very conscious of their online presence and the films created this year demonstrated the understanding that the girls have developed.  As for winning, the girls had convinced themselves that third place was honourable so to win was fabulous and the big cheque was taken on a tour of the London sights.  The whole school is proud of the girls and we’re already encouraging the students to think of ideas for 2015.”

Partnership deal provides significant boost for multimedia teaching and student engagement – Education Today,"['Flexible Learning', 'News', 'Reward & Recognition']","July 17, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/partnership-deal-provides-significant-boost-for-multimedia-teaching-and-student-engagement/,"Vivo and Mobento, two emerging players in the education technology sector have formed a strategic partnership to significantly boost student engagement and increase the breadth of multimedia content available to teachers and students in schools and colleges. The partnership will make video and audio content easier for teachers to find and use and will introduce gamification to reward and motivate students to learn through multimedia content.
London based Vivo, the award-winning recognition and rewards platform, is already used in 650 UK schools, including 20% of secondary schools. The platform is a content-rich social network for students, geared towards making ‘doing good things’ fun. Think charity campaigns, careers advice, inspiring celebrities and volunteering opportunities. It’s a safe environment to access the most enlightening content on the net. Vivo allows teachers to track and analyse student achievements and behaviour. Gamification tools enable students to compete against each other, unlock rewards and build up a Vivo profile. Students can also accumulate vivos to exchange with a number of retail partners, such as New Look and Argos. The partnership with Mobento will significantly increase the multi-media content available to the Vivo user base and help further enrich classrooms.
Mobento, headquartered in New York, is a cloud-based video learning platform, providing multimedia educational content.  It offers over 4,300+ videos, from NASA to Cambridge University, TED Talks, Stanford, Yale and the Khan Academy. Schools can sign up for private accounts to easily centralise, distribute, create courses and track student progress with a blend of multimedia content from their school’s resources and world-class teachers, scientists, business leaders and institutions in Mobento’s public library. Students can engage with diverse content from every field across the education spectrum from footage of Mark Ronson talking about music and remixing to Mark Zuckerberg on how he built Facebook.
The partnership with Vivo means that teachers subscribing to Mobento’s school accounts can now achieve a higher level of engagement, motivating their students to use multi-media content, with Vivo’s gamification and system of rewards.
George Grima, founder of Vivo comments: “We believe that this partnership gives schools and colleges major benefits in terms of accessible content and engagement, with the added motivation provided by gamification and reward.  Vivo’s userbase has grown significantly over the last year.  We now have 80% market share and working with Mobento is an important partnership as part of our international growth strategy.”
The partnership will mean that VivoLite, Vivo’s free-to-use platform, will be available to all Mobento subscribers offering reward based gamification for every video watched.  In addition, schools subscribing to VivoMiles will be able to access Mobento’s diverse range of multimedia content and curation.
Sumner Murphy, founder of Mobento comments: “Contemporary students have grown up with multi-media content and gamification. It makes perfect sense to combine the two to help teachers promote a higher level of engagement in schools.  Our user base now spans 196 countries and we are very excited by the additional motivation we can now offer.”",vivo and mobento two emerging player in the education technology sector have formed a strategic partnership to significantly boost student engagement and increase the breadth of multimedia content available to teacher and student in school and college the partnership will make video and audio content easier for teacher to find and use and will introduce gamification to reward and motivate student to learn through multimedia content london based vivo the awardwinning recognition and reward platform is already used in uk school including of secondary school the platform is a contentrich social network for student geared towards making doing good thing fun think charity campaign career advice inspiring celebrity and volunteering opportunity it a safe environment to access the most enlightening content on the net vivo allows teacher to track and analyse student achievement and behaviour gamification tool enable student to compete against each other unlock reward and build up a vivo profile student can also accumulate vivos to exchange with a number of retail partner such a new look and argo the partnership with mobento will significantly increase the multimedia content available to the vivo user base and help further enrich classroom mobento headquartered in new york is a cloudbased video learning platform providing multimedia educational content it offer over video from nasa to cambridge university ted talk stanford yale and the khan academy school can sign up for private account to easily centralise distribute create course and track student progress with a blend of multimedia content from their school resource and worldclass teacher scientist business leader and institution in mobentos public library student can engage with diverse content from every field across the education spectrum from footage of mark ronson talking about music and remixing to mark zuckerberg on how he built facebook the partnership with vivo mean that teacher subscribing to mobentos school account can now achieve a higher level of engagement motivating their student to use multimedia content with vivos gamification and system of reward george grima founder of vivo comment we believe that this partnership give school and college major benefit in term of accessible content and engagement with the added motivation provided by gamification and reward vivos userbase ha grown significantly over the last year we now have market share and working with mobento is an important partnership a part of our international growth strategy the partnership will mean that vivolite vivos freetouse platform will be available to all mobento subscriber offering reward based gamification for every video watched in addition school subscribing to vivomiles will be able to access mobentos diverse range of multimedia content and curation sumner murphy founder of mobento comment contemporary student have grown up with multimedia content and gamification it make perfect sense to combine the two to help teacher promote a higher level of engagement in school our user base now span country and we are very excited by the additional motivation we can now offer,"['scientist', 'student', 'remixing', 'university', 'facebook', 'stanford', 'charity', 'awardwinning', 'worldclass', 'volunteering']"
Portcullis launches Raspberry Pi secondary school competition – Education Today,"['Competition', 'News', 'Secondary schools']","July 11, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/portcullis-launches-raspberry-pi-secondary-school-competition/,"Portcullis Computer Security, information security specialist, has announced the launch of an ICT competition targeted at secondary schools within the London Borough of Hillingdon. The competition is aimed at reinforcing the government’s amended ICT syllabus for schools, and is based on the Raspberry Pi, a small, fully functional Linux-based PC that was developed specifically for use in promoting computer science education.
Participating schools will be given 10 Raspberry Pi computers each and will have 10 weeks from the start of term in September to use those machines to develop something that will benefit their local community or individuals within those communities. Each school will also receive full competition packs prior to September comprising teaching materials, classroom challenges and games to assist students with the creation of their entries.
 The competition was officially launched at Ruislip High School on July 10 where a team from Portcullis delivered an in-depth overview of the technology, the competition and what is expected from entries.
“This has been a positive day for all the students involved,” says Sunaina Shori, curriculum leader for ICT at Ruislip High School. For them to hear and learn from people working in industry about the exciting and challenging experiences they’ve had on a practical level and about how important security is has made a huge difference. It really makes them think about how they can use the skills they’re developing at school in future careers. The practical experience of using the Raspberry Pi’s and practising with the programming has been really beneficial. We have a number of students who are very interested in applying for the competition and developing something of their own.”
Tim Anderson, commercial director, Portcullis says: “There is a definite gap in the education sector with students missing the fundamentals of coding and programming. A lot of young people think they are good with computers but when it comes to understanding how computers work, we have a lot of passengers and not enough mechanics. Many kids lack the skills to do anything tangible with what they know
“The Portcullis team has a genuine passion for technology and the industry in which we operate, and we’re delighted to be able to use this opportunity to encourage secondary schools and students to explore the opportunities that programming can present in advance of the new computer science syllabus launching in September.”
Participating schools will have until November 7 to finalise their entries, which will be judged at the end of the month at Portcullis’ Watford offices. First prize is a trip to Bletchley Park, while second and third prizes will be Raspberry Pi based.
With only 10 spaces in the competition interested schools are encouraged to get in touch with Portcullis as soon as possible to secure their place. Participating schools include Ruislip High School, Haydon High School, Queensmead High School, and Watford University Tech College.",portcullis computer security information security specialist ha announced the launch of an ict competition targeted at secondary school within the london borough of hillingdon the competition is aimed at reinforcing the government amended ict syllabus for school and is based on the raspberry pi a small fully functional linuxbased pc that wa developed specifically for use in promoting computer science education participating school will be given raspberry pi computer each and will have week from the start of term in september to use those machine to develop something that will benefit their local community or individual within those community each school will also receive full competition pack prior to september comprising teaching material classroom challenge and game to assist student with the creation of their entry the competition wa officially launched at ruislip high school on july where a team from portcullis delivered an indepth overview of the technology the competition and what is expected from entry this ha been a positive day for all the student involved say sunaina shori curriculum leader for ict at ruislip high school for them to hear and learn from people working in industry about the exciting and challenging experience theyve had on a practical level and about how important security is ha made a huge difference it really make them think about how they can use the skill theyre developing at school in future career the practical experience of using the raspberry pi and practising with the programming ha been really beneficial we have a number of student who are very interested in applying for the competition and developing something of their own tim anderson commercial director portcullis say there is a definite gap in the education sector with student missing the fundamental of coding and programming a lot of young people think they are good with computer but when it come to understanding how computer work we have a lot of passenger and not enough mechanic many kid lack the skill to do anything tangible with what they know the portcullis team ha a genuine passion for technology and the industry in which we operate and were delighted to be able to use this opportunity to encourage secondary school and student to explore the opportunity that programming can present in advance of the new computer science syllabus launching in september participating school will have until november to finalise their entry which will be judged at the end of the month at portcullis watford office first prize is a trip to bletchley park while second and third prize will be raspberry pi based with only space in the competition interested school are encouraged to get in touch with portcullis a soon a possible to secure their place participating school include ruislip high school haydon high school queensmead high school and watford university tech college,"['science', 'student', 'pc', 'watford', 'university', 'competition', 'raspberry', 'classroom', 'july', 'linuxbased']"

This year, the Inclusive League, which is in its second year, was attended by parents, coaches, the Madame Speaker of Hackney Council, Councillor Sharon Patrick, and Mike Gatting the MCC President.
The seven borough finalists who qualified for the Final’s day at Lords were:

Essex Primary School – Newham
Salisbury Primary School – Newham
St Luke’s C of E Primary School – Tower Hamlets
St Saviour’s Primary School – Westminster
New End Primary School – Camden
St Aloysius Catholic Junior School – Camden

Speaking at the event, Chris Grigg, CEO of British Land said:

Into Film and Doc Academy urge schools to teach conscious use of the internet – Education Today,"['KS4', 'Literacy', 'News', 'Teaching resources']","July 3, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/into-film-and-doc-academy-urge-schools-to-teach-conscious-use-of-the-internet/,"What does it mean to be addicted to something and how much time on the internet is too much?  What is the role of Facebook, Google and other major corporations behind the internet?  What are the consequences of cyberbullying?  These and other vital questions about the influence of the worldwide web on modern teenagers are the focus of a hard hitting new resource for Key Stage 4 English teachers created by education charity Into Film and documentary focused education resource provider Doc Academy.
The resource is inspired by filmmaker Beeban Kidron’s thought provoking documentary InRealLife, which investigates the complex relationship different groups of young people have with the internet. Launched on 2nd July it is aimed as a tool for use by teachers now to encourage young people to use the internet safely over the summer holidays, and in the new school year to reinforce messages about online safety and support the curriculum in English, with cross curricular pointers to ICT, PSHCE and Media Studies.
A five unit lesson plan supplemented by teacher’s notes and clips from the film invites pupils to engage with the material and develop their reading, writing and spoken language skills through activities ranging from producing a Prezi presentation to holding a Question Time debate, writing a blog, creating a campaign advert and making a video diary.   Included are links to other useful resources and short films made by young people around the subject of internet safety.
The full resource and film clips are available to download at https://docacademy.org/films/19/real-life/; copies of InRealLife are free to order for all schools with an Into Film Club and a PDF of the lesson plan can be downloaded at http://www.intofilm.org/inreallife-resource
Education specialist and former Head of Faculty and Assistant Headteacher Shane Richardson, who wrote the resource, says: “InRealLife is one of the most important films for the 21st Century classroom.  Its searing deconstruction of how the internet impacts the everyday lives of young people, and the sometimes appalling consequences, are prime material for engaging students. This film will challenge and fascinate students in equal measure, providing an excellent opportunity for learning.”",what doe it mean to be addicted to something and how much time on the internet is too much what is the role of facebook google and other major corporation behind the internet what are the consequence of cyberbullying these and other vital question about the influence of the worldwide web on modern teenager are the focus of a hard hitting new resource for key stage english teacher created by education charity into film and documentary focused education resource provider doc academy the resource is inspired by filmmaker beeban kidrons thought provoking documentary inreallife which investigates the complex relationship different group of young people have with the internet launched on nd july it is aimed a a tool for use by teacher now to encourage young people to use the internet safely over the summer holiday and in the new school year to reinforce message about online safety and support the curriculum in english with cross curricular pointer to ict pshce and medium study a five unit lesson plan supplemented by teacher note and clip from the film invite pupil to engage with the material and develop their reading writing and spoken language skill through activity ranging from producing a prezi presentation to holding a question time debate writing a blog creating a campaign advert and making a video diary included are link to other useful resource and short film made by young people around the subject of internet safety the full resource and film clip are available to download at education specialist and former head of faculty and assistant headteacher shane richardson who wrote the resource say inreallife is one of the most important film for the st century classroom it searing deconstruction of how the internet impact the everyday life of young people and the sometimes appalling consequence are prime material for engaging student this film will challenge and fascinate student in equal measure providing an excellent opportunity for learning,"['download', 'headteacher', 'addicted', 'documentary', 'blog', 'online', 'internet', 'facebook', 'google', 'cyberbullying']"
‘Birmingham Band Slam’ – school pupils showcase band musicianship skills for first time – Education Today,"['KS3', 'Music, Stage & Drama', 'News']","July 2, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/birmingham-band-slam-school-pupils-showcase-band-musicianship-skills-for-first-time/,"Students at ARK Kings Academy will showcase the results of their Band Musicianship Programme at a showcase event on Wednesday 9th July.
The pioneering Band Musicianship Programme started in January giving each student in Year 7 and 8 the opportunity to learn singing, guitar (including bass guitar), keyboard and drum-kit. Working alongside specialist teachers the students have developed their skills in each instrument and have now formed bands which will perform for the first time at the event in front of parents, friends, other students, teachers and members of the local community.
Paul Bull, Head of Music at ARK Kings said, “I’m delighted with the success that we’ve seen with our Band Musicianship programme at ARK Kings Academy. This is a unique programme which has given, and will continue to give, our students a wonderful opportunity to learn several new instruments, develop their music skills and build their confidence. At ARK Kings we are committed to providing the best possible musical education – music is a life skill that can open new doors and expand the horizons of our most talented young people”.
Nathan Portlock is the specialist teacher appointed to lead on guitar skills. He said, “It’s great to be involved in such a ground-breaking initiative. I’ve worked in music education for over seven years and I’ve never come across a school programme like this. It’s exciting because it provides every pupil aged 11 to 13 with a place where they can learn to compose, collaborate, play and even record new original music. Too often musical interventions in learning are short term affairs that target a small number of pupils. This approach creates healthy competition across the entire year group – it is said that talent is universal but opportunity isn’t – not at ARK Kings!”
The Band Musicianship Programme has been so successful that it will continue next year and incorporate the new Year 7 intake so that it spans Years 7-9. The programme has been incorporated into the existing music curriculum and students have the option to take up additional instrumental tuition in Years 10 and 11.
This will be a busy week for some ARK Kings students who will also be performing in the annual ARK music gala on Monday 7th July which brings together students from across all ARK schools to play at a special concert at the world renowned Barbican Centre in London.",student at ark king academy will showcase the result of their band musicianship programme at a showcase event on wednesday th july the pioneering band musicianship programme started in january giving each student in year and the opportunity to learn singing guitar including bass guitar keyboard and drumkit working alongside specialist teacher the student have developed their skill in each instrument and have now formed band which will perform for the first time at the event in front of parent friend other student teacher and member of the local community paul bull head of music at ark king said im delighted with the success that weve seen with our band musicianship programme at ark king academy this is a unique programme which ha given and will continue to give our student a wonderful opportunity to learn several new instrument develop their music skill and build their confidence at ark king we are committed to providing the best possible musical education music is a life skill that can open new door and expand the horizon of our most talented young people nathan portlock is the specialist teacher appointed to lead on guitar skill he said it great to be involved in such a groundbreaking initiative ive worked in music education for over seven year and ive never come across a school programme like this it exciting because it provides every pupil aged to with a place where they can learn to compose collaborate play and even record new original music too often musical intervention in learning are short term affair that target a small number of pupil this approach creates healthy competition across the entire year group it is said that talent is universal but opportunity isnt not at ark king the band musicianship programme ha been so successful that it will continue next year and incorporate the new year intake so that it span year the programme ha been incorporated into the existing music curriculum and student have the option to take up additional instrumental tuition in year and this will be a busy week for some ark king student who will also be performing in the annual ark music gala on monday th july which brings together student from across all ark school to play at a special concert at the world renowned barbican centre in london,"['performing', 'band', 'student', 'musicianship', 'teacher', 'january', 'annual', 'wednesday', 'july', 'concert']"
"Three schools win national competition to secure £350,000 in energy makeovers – Education Today","['Music, Stage & Drama', 'News', 'Teaching resources']","June 30, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/three-schools-win-national-competition-to-secure-350000-in-energy-makeovers/,"Pupils from across the country have danced their way to a greener future, winning the British Gas Generation Green Energy Performance 2014.
The national competition saw students from schools across the country submit a design for their ultimate eco-house, with the hope being invited down to the finals in London which took place yesterday. The six finalists, chosen from over 500 entries, competed on a specially commissioned dance floor, which captures the energy created by students’ dance steps and harvests it to generate electricity.  Beecholme Primary School in Mitcham, Alford Primary School in Aberdeenshire and Okehampton College in Devon triumphed against their competitors to win Energy Makeovers worth up to £150,000 each.
Diversity dance stars Jordan and Perri judged the competition, with the winning schools chosen based on the creativity of their routines and the amount of energy they produced.
The Generation Green Energy Performance forms part of British Gas’ ongoing commitment to inspire curiosity in young people and help bring energy to life. Last year, British Gas invested over £1.6 million installing energy saving equipment for schools through Generation Green, helping to save an estimated 400 tons of CO2 and saving the winning schools an estimated £100,000 a year on energy bills.
Teacher Keith Webb from Okehampton College said, “The students are so happy to have won such an incredible prize for the school, and we’re very proud of them. They’ve had an amazing day; the dance floor is a really interesting way to teach young people about sustainable energy, and dancing with Jordan and Perri has been great fun. We’re looking forward to making the most of this wonderful prize.”
Ambassadors Perri & Jordan from Diversity said; “We were really impressed by the dancing we saw today. The kids brought some electric moves to the floor and generated a lot of energy. It’s been great to judge the Generation Green Energy Performance, using new technology like a dance floor that turns movement into electricity makes energy easier to understand, and much more exciting to learn about.”
Abi Robins, Director of Corporate Responsibility Programmes at British Gas, said, “The aim of the Generation Green Energy Performance is to teach children about sustainability and inspire them to be curious about energy. We want to encourage young people to think about dynamic ways to reduce energy use within schools and the wider community, and help to create a generation of energy innovators. We can’t wait to see how [insert name of school] transform their school with the energy efficiency equipment.”

Bursaries for lucrative superyacht career still up for grabs – Education Today,"['Bursaries', 'News']","June 26, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/bursaries-for-lucrative-superyacht-career-still-up-for-grabs/,"Isle of Wight-based youth education charity UKSA still has 12 coveted bursaries left to allocate on its world-renowned four-year cadetship, which includes a Foundation Degree in Operational Yacht Science delivered in conjunction with Falmouth Marine School and validated by the University of Plymouth. Training begins in October and allows students to ‘earn whilst they learn’ and train for a well paid and exciting career on superyachts, which typically sell for over £100million.
These Yachting Cadetships for 18-25-year-olds are generously part funded by two of the leading UK maritime charities, which makes them accessible to everyone and an immediately viable option for those considering vocational training over the more traditional study or career paths.
Six of the bursaries are available via Trinity House and amount to £17,880 of assistance/funding (£3,000 is towards the Foundation Degree in Year 2 and the rest for the first phase of training at UKSA’s Isle of Wight campus). But hurry as you’ve only got until mid July to apply for these six!
Alternatively, another six are available from Seafarers UK, at £10,500 for the 5-month phase one training (£2,000 of which is from the Milo Hanlon* Bursary). You have until mid September to apply and be selected and priority will be given to those who display a clear welfare need and/or have a proven family connection to the maritime industry.
UKSA Cadetship Manager, Emma Baggett, explains: “With expensive tuition fees and graduate unemployment rates, vocational training has definitely become the new university – and ours is particularly in demand because of these bursaries on offer.  Our yachting cadets can easily graduate debt-free because of what they earn during what amounts to some two years of paid work placements, plus food and accommodation is included in the cost of training. Once onboard a vessel almost all of the student’s living costs are covered by the yacht too.
“With the help of Trinity House and Seafarers UK, aspiring young captains can now take the first step into this unique career path, because the work placement phases – entry level professional deckhands can typically earn €2000 a month tax free (not including tips) working in locations across Europe and the Caribbean – are a proven means of funding the rest of the cadetship
“We currently have some150 cadets at various stages of their training working in the industry and it’s our global relationships with crew agents and captains themselves that make the cadetship so successful. This support, which carries on throughout their careers, is unique to UKSA.
“The FdSc Foundation Degree was recently granted full-time status and can now be applied for through UCAS, plus successful 2014 cadets will be able to drawn down on student loans to assist them further – as well as taking advantage of all the other associated benefits that full-time students enjoy. Consequently, it’s become an internationally recognised qualification that will not only shape and reinforce a young crew’s career path, but also offer a transferable qualification for later life.”
Applicants should have obtained at least 120 UCAS points (or the equivalent in work experience) and have high grade passes in GCSE Maths and English. You must be seeking a genuine alternative to university and also demonstrate a keen desire for a long term career in the superyacht industry – and whilst previous water sports and/or yachting experience is highly desirable, it is not essential.
For further cadetship bursary details contact UKSA’s career advisors on 01983 203038, or email careers@uksa.org. For those not accepted onto their chosen bursary, there is the option of a Career Development Loan worth up to £10,000 – and the rest contributed by the student.
Other routes via a career development loan include the 23-week Professional Yachtmaster Ocean course (£14,995), which is basically the first two phases of the cadetship. This is increasingly proving popular with the older generation too, who have a spare six months through redundancy, early retirement or a lifelong desire to try something different, but can quickly recoup the costs via a profession that offers very well paid starter salaries.
UKSA’s six-week Crew Training for 18-25s is the most simple and cost effective way of gaining employment as a deckhand or crew on yachts of all sizes, including superyachts. It costs just £3,995 (you would spend the same on a basic plumbing course, stuck at home, in your local college) but once employed students can typically earn enough money in a year to fund the cadetship.
If you want to skipper your own yacht, work with charter and flotilla companies, carry out short haul deliveries, or teach yachting, then Professional Yachtmaster Offshore opens doors to the whole industry. This 13-week intensive course costs £7,250, is world renowned, and also attracts 25-30 year old manager types, looking for a career change, but entry at the appropriate level. As an example, those working on decent sized charter boats can generally live on tips alone and double a circa £30,000 per annum salary that could remain untouched in the bank.
For those more suited to working below deck, or attracted to glitz and glamour, UKSA’s Superyacht Interior Foundation course (just three weeks long and only £2,600) is a whistle stop tour of working in the uber rich and cool superyacht industry. It will equip you with all the hospitality and personal skills needed to excel in the playground of the seriously wealthy, together with the essential safety training required for work on board.

Lack of educational psychologists in schools could leave most vulnerable children at risk      – Education Today,"['Behaviour & Special Needs', 'News']","June 24, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/lack-of-educational-psychologists-in-schools-could-leave-most-vulnerable-children-at-risk/,"The Association of Educational Psychologists (AEP) has warned that the lack of a sufficient supply of educational psychologists in schools settings will be detrimental to special educational needs (SEN) proposals currently being outlined, despite welcoming the Government’s acknowledgement of the essential role that educational psychologists play in the lives of children and young people with SEN.
In response to the publication of the SEN Code of Practice for parliamentary approval by the Department for Education, the AEP has stressed that an uncertain funding future for the initial training of the educational psychology workforce and the ever increasing demand for educational psychologists’ posts will mean that there will be an insufficient number of educational psychologists supporting local authorities and schools in future, which could put the wellbeing of vulnerable children and young people across the country at risk. Educational psychologists play a key part in helping shape how educational settings approach SEN, including identifying what specific support a child may require during their education and helping teachers and other professionals to tailor the services provided to the child’s individual needs.
Kate Fallon, General Secretary of the Association of Educational Psychologists, said:
“Although we are pleased the draft SEN Code of Practice recognises the prominent role educational psychologists have in ensuring the wellbeing of all children and young people with special educational needs, we are concerned that there are not enough educational psychologists in nurseries, schools and colleges to carry out the proposals outlined in the draft.
 
“We are reaching the point when educational psychologists will not be able to meet all the demands on their time. There is already a shortage of educational psychologists, but the workforce is being placed under increasing pressure to provide more and more school SEN and mental health support services in an environment where the number of new schools and new types of schools is rising along with a growing number of pupils leading to an increase in the number of young people with special needs and behavioural difficulties. There has never been a worse time for there to be uncertainty over how the training of future educational psychologists will be funded. The Government needs to ensure that there is secure long-term funding for the training of educational psychologists with some urgency”",the association of educational psychologist aep ha warned that the lack of a sufficient supply of educational psychologist in school setting will be detrimental to special educational need sen proposal currently being outlined despite welcoming the government acknowledgement of the essential role that educational psychologist play in the life of child and young people with sen in response to the publication of the sen code of practice for parliamentary approval by the department for education the aep ha stressed that an uncertain funding future for the initial training of the educational psychology workforce and the ever increasing demand for educational psychologist post will mean that there will be an insufficient number of educational psychologist supporting local authority and school in future which could put the wellbeing of vulnerable child and young people across the country at risk educational psychologist play a key part in helping shape how educational setting approach sen including identifying what specific support a child may require during their education and helping teacher and other professional to tailor the service provided to the child individual need kate fallon general secretary of the association of educational psychologist said although we are pleased the draft sen code of practice recognises the prominent role educational psychologist have in ensuring the wellbeing of all child and young people with special educational need we are concerned that there are not enough educational psychologist in nursery school and college to carry out the proposal outlined in the draft we are reaching the point when educational psychologist will not be able to meet all the demand on their time there is already a shortage of educational psychologist but the workforce is being placed under increasing pressure to provide more and more school sen and mental health support service in an environment where the number of new school and new type of school is rising along with a growing number of pupil leading to an increase in the number of young people with special need and behavioural difficulty there ha never been a worse time for there to be uncertainty over how the training of future educational psychologist will be funded the government need to ensure that there is secure longterm funding for the training of educational psychologist with some urgency,"['training', 'difficulty', 'urgency', 'worse', 'education', 'detrimental', 'psychology', 'shortage', 'teacher', 'psychologist']"
Frogtrade evolves into Frog Education – Education Today,['News'],"June 19, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/frogtrade-evolves-into-frog-education/,"Leading education technology provider Frog has announced it will be changing its name from Frogtrade to Frog Education.
The new name, the first since the company began in 1999, will seek to better reflect Frog’s 15 year evolution from technology provider to education solutions specialist.
The name change will be officially unveiled at Frog’s annual conference on 24th June in Birmingham, where visionary education leaders will speak about some of the biggest issues facing schools today.
The announcement has come at an exciting for Frog, with the company having recently been awarded a place in the inaugural Sunday Times PA Consulting Inward Investment Track Ones to Recognise. The Fast Track award, supported by UK Trade & Investment, highlighted 20 up-and-coming foreign backed, mid-market businesses across the UK.
Used by over 12million students, teachers and parents worldwide, Frog works with schools to use technology to improve performance and personalise the learning journey of every child.
Commenting, Gareth Davies, Managing Director at Frog, said:
“For the last 15 years, Frog has been providing world-class technology to the education market under the trading name, Frogtrade. This name does not fairly reflect the customers we service or the products and services we provide.
“Our technology is a tool which is integrated into the culture and ethos of each of our schools, improving every aspect of the learning and teaching experience.

Succession planning more important in education than at any time in the last five years – Education Today,"['News', 'Recruitment']","June 17, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/succession-planning-more-important-in-education-than-at-any-time-in-the-last-five-years/,"Senior teachers say succession planning is now more important to schools than it was in 2009, according to the latest research from Randstad Education, the specialist recruiter.  In a poll of senior teachers undertaken by Randstad Education, 43 per cent of respondents said succession planning was now more important than it was five years ago.
Succession planning focuses on identifying potential future leaders to fill key positions.  In a climate of talent shortage and lack of confidence in leadership potential, there is renewed interest in succession planning.  59 per cent of senior teachers said it is set to become a higher priority in the future – with none suggesting it was going to become less important.
Despite this, the results suggested 35 per cent of schools are failing to undertake succession planning of any kind.  A similar poll of 100 HR directors working in the private sector revealed 21 per cent of employers across the UK fail to undertake succession planning.
Jenny Rollinson, managing director of Randstad Education, said: “Sound succession planning gives teachers a strong sense of having a clearly defined future within the school.  This is a powerful retention tool which taps into career fulfilment.  With escalating shortages at senior and middle level teaching professionals, it’s more important than ever to take all opportunities to retain the best and brightest teachers.  By ignoring its potential, senior teams and boards of governors alike are missing a trick. However, CEOs in the private sector have a luxury that Head Teachers simply don’t have – the support of an HR department”
However, amongst those schools that do succession plan, 43 per cent of senior teachers said they focus their succession planning on the top three levels of management and below – compared to the UK average of 37 per cent.
She continued: “When schools do succession planning – which admittedly is not as often as they should – schools do it well.  Education professionals look further into the future when they recruit and when they promote. They don’t just look at qualifications and skills, they look at staff/pupil/parent relationship building skills and the right fit.  We suspect that when it comes to hiring people who look like they might make good heads of department, or assistant heads, senior teams are using some of the skills they have honed in the classroom, rooting out potential in their students.”",senior teacher say succession planning is now more important to school than it wa in according to the latest research from randstad education the specialist recruiter in a poll of senior teacher undertaken by randstad education per cent of respondent said succession planning wa now more important than it wa five year ago succession planning focus on identifying potential future leader to fill key position in a climate of talent shortage and lack of confidence in leadership potential there is renewed interest in succession planning per cent of senior teacher said it is set to become a higher priority in the future with none suggesting it wa going to become le important despite this the result suggested per cent of school are failing to undertake succession planning of any kind a similar poll of hr director working in the private sector revealed per cent of employer across the uk fail to undertake succession planning jenny rollinson managing director of randstad education said sound succession planning give teacher a strong sense of having a clearly defined future within the school this is a powerful retention tool which tap into career fulfilment with escalating shortage at senior and middle level teaching professional it more important than ever to take all opportunity to retain the best and brightest teacher by ignoring it potential senior team and board of governor alike are missing a trick however ceo in the private sector have a luxury that head teacher simply dont have the support of an hr department however amongst those school that do succession plan per cent of senior teacher said they focus their succession planning on the top three level of management and below compared to the uk average of per cent she continued when school do succession planning which admittedly is not a often a they should school do it well education professional look further into the future when they recruit and when they promote they dont just look at qualification and skill they look at staffpupilparent relationship building skill and the right fit we suspect that when it come to hiring people who look like they might make good head of department or assistant head senior team are using some of the skill they have honed in the classroom rooting out potential in their student,"['teaching', 'employer', 'staffpupilparent', 'professional', 'hiring', 'recruit', 'latest', 'recruiter', 'teacher', 'ceo']"
Teachers to warn children of the link between smoking and blindness – Education Today,"['News', 'Teaching resources', 'Wellbeing']","June 16, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/teachers-to-warn-children-of-the-link-between-smoking-and-blindness/,"The blind chief executive of a national charity is appealing to teachers to help get the message across to children that smoking causes sight loss. Tony Rucinski’s views underpin a new resource pack being launched by the Macular Society, to help teachers explain the link between smoking and blindness.
According to the Macular Society, most of the 600 UK youngsters who start smoking every day don’t know that tobacco could eventually cost them their sight. A survey of 10 year olds found that 98% did not know that smoking causes blindness, but feared sight loss more than any other major consequence of smoking.
Research suggests smokers are up to four times more likely to get macular degeneration compared with non-smokers. Smokers with certain genes may be 20 times more likely to get it. The combination of smoking and genetics may account for as much as a third of all macular degeneration.
The resource packs for educators are part of Is it Real?, a viral video campaign to raise awareness of this issue. Liaising with teachers to effectively deliver the message of smoking causing blindness is key to the campaign. Resources could be used in subjects including art, science and PSHE. They are available to download on the campaign website www.is-it-real.org.
The campaign uses a series of three intriguing and unsettling videos designed to be shared on social network sites. For the launch the Macular Society has partnered with VivoMiles.com, a schools’ reward platform with 1.4 million users and a proven track record in bringing campaigns like this to millions of students. A questionnaire on attitudes to smoking will be included in the campaign which at least 20,000 children are expected to complete.
Consultant ophthalmologist, Phillip Moradi, from Moorfields Eye Hospital in London conducted the survey and will analyse the new data.
He said: “We need to have better information on which health messages will work with children. At the moment 600 children in the UK start smoking every day. That represents a devastating effect on the health of these young people later in their lives. It may seem logical to concentrate health messages on the life-threatening consequences of smoking but it may be that raising awareness of the risk of blindness would be more effective.”
The Society is criticising the slow progress in implementing an EU directive to put sight loss warnings on cigarette packets which was first agreed in 2012 and says current smoking advice often ignores the link with blindness.
Tony Rucinski , Chief Executive of the Macular Society, said: “We are failing children if we don’t tell them about the full dangers of smoking. Smokers are up to four times more likely to develop macular degeneration than people who have never smoked. Smokers with certain genetic characteristics are 20 times more likely to get it. The fact is that macular degeneration is the biggest cause of sight loss in the UK. 200 people a day start to lose their sight because of it. Children are, rightly, concerned about the prospect of living with sight loss but adults seem to overlook this when planning anti-smoking campaigns. Anti-smoking messages must highlight the risk to sight.
“We recognise that teachers play a vital role in presenting effective health messages to children. I hope the exciting teaching resources combined with the videos we have created will help to inspire people within the education sector to get involved with the campaign.”
The resource packs offer activities, tools and inspiration for educators to teach young children about the dangers of smoking and the increased risk of blindness in later life including:

A Fact-Sheet about macular degeneration, its symptoms, causes and a series of interesting facts and figures to start conversations about what causes blindness.
KS3 suggested lesson ideas in the areas of Art and Design, Science and Personal Social and Health Education (PSHE) as follows:

Art: exercises to help children understand and empathise with people affected by the condition  by visualising the impact central sight loss would have in the way they interact with their everyday environment 
Science: Ideas and information on how to incorporate macular degeneration into science lessons and the study of the eye.
PSHE: A lesson plan to explore the link between smoking and blindness and the emotional and social implications sight loss can have for people  


Film making competition tools – a guide on how the Is it real? film competition can be incorporated into lessons. In this competition children are encouraged to develop a 16 second film inspired by a series of quotesabout how people with thecondition see the world.
Make your own simulation specs – a maker’s pack for children to create their own simulation specs and truly understand how it feels to have macular degeneration.
Stop smoking hints and tips – information and facts to help children, friends or a family member to stop smoking.

The campaign was devised in collaboration with Commonland, the design research specialist and was the result of workshops to explore children’s understanding of macular degeneration.
George Lee, founder of Commonland, said: “Young people don’t like being told what to do and traditional health warnings rarely work. During our research we realised most young children do not know about the link between smoking and blindness. Working closely with Macular Society we wanted to engage young people in the experience of macular degeneration by sparking their curiosity and empathy for people with the condition in a format they would feel compelled to share with others.”",the blind chief executive of a national charity is appealing to teacher to help get the message across to child that smoking cause sight loss tony

Kids get active: thousands march for safer streets – Education Today,['News'],"June 12, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/kids-get-active-thousands-march-for-safer-streets/,"Over 100,000 children from over 600 schools across the UK took to the streets yesterday as part of the Giant Walking Bus, an initiative coordinated by Brake, the road safety charity, and webuyanycar.com. The event aimed to give children a voice, calling on drivers and government to make their streets safer for walking and cycling, to enable them to live healthy, active lifestyles.
In a survey by Brake and webuyanycar.com of almost 5,000 children taking part in the event, they expressed their wish to get out and about more on foot and bike, and for safer streets to allow them to do so. The survey found:
· Three quarters (76%) of students would like to walk and cycle more, to get to school, go to the park, or to see friends.
· More than half (56%) worry they might be run over by traffic when walking or cycling on roads.
· Four in five (81%) think drivers should go slower around their school or home.
With childhood obesity on the rise – three in 10 (28%) children in England aged two to 15 are overweight or obese -it is more critical than ever that children can live more active lifestyles. One of the simplest ways to achieve this is to build active travel into their everyday routine – and as Brake and webuyanycar.com’s survey shows, the kids themselves want to walk and reclaim the streets.
However, with 33 children killed and 1,836 seriously injured while walking or cycling in Great Britain in 2012 alone (latest figures) many parents are understandably fearful to let their children travel to school, the park or friends’ houses this way. Almost half (44%) of primary school children are now driven to school impacting on children’s health and contributing to congestion and traffic danger.
Brake is calling on drivers and government to take action to make streets safer for kids and help them enjoy a healthy, active, happy childhood, by backing Brake’s GO 20 campaign. For drivers, this means slowing down to 20mph or less wherever there may be people on foot or bike, and always keeping a look out for vulnerable road users. For government, this means implementing widespread 20mph speed limits in towns, cities and villages – one of the most effective measures identified by the World Health Organisation to reduce pedestrian casualties
Julie Townsend, deputy chief executive, Brake, said: “The thousands of kids out on the streets yesterday should send a clear message to everyone: kids want to be able to get out and walk and cycle, and by not making our streets safe, we are denying them the fun, active childhoods they deserve. This has serious implications for their long-term health and wellbeing, the burden on our NHS, the environment, and our society as a whole. If we are going to create an environment fit for our children we need to put them – not motor vehicles – first. We are appealing to drivers to slow down to 20mph or less around homes, schools and shops, to local authorities to continue rolling out 20mph limits, and to national government to make 20mph the national urban default. We need to make sure our kids and people of all ages – not just the lucky few – can walk and cycle without being endangered.”
Richard Evans, campaign spokesperson for road safety at webuyanycar.com said: “Children want to be active and it’s our responsibility as road users to ensure they feel safe. Being able to cycle or walk to and from school should be a childhood right, not a luxury. We want yesterday’s event to work as a wakeup call to drivers – children want their roads to be safe and it’s our privilege, at webuyanycar,com, to help the voices of over 100,000 children be heard.”",over child from over school across the uk took to the street yesterday a part of the giant walking bus an initiative coordinated by brake the road safety charity and the event aimed to give child a voice calling on driver and government to make their street safer for walking and cycling to enable them to live healthy active lifestyle in a survey by brake and of almost child taking part in the event they expressed their wish to get out and about more on foot and bike and for safer street to allow them to do so the survey found · three quarter of student would like to walk and cycle more to get to school go to the park or to see friend · more than half worry they might be run over by traffic when walking or cycling on road · four in five think driver should go slower around their school or home with childhood obesity on the rise three in child in england aged two to are overweight or obese it is more critical than ever that child can live more active lifestyle one of the simplest way to achieve this is to build active travel into their everyday routine and a brake and survey show the kid themselves want to walk and reclaim the street however with child killed and seriously injured while walking or cycling in great britain in alone latest figure many parent are understandably fearful to let their child travel to school the park or friend house this way almost half of primary school child are now driven to school impacting on childrens health and contributing to congestion and traffic danger brake is calling on driver and government to take action to make street safer for kid and help them enjoy a healthy active happy childhood by backing brake go campaign for driver this mean slowing down to mph or le wherever there may be people on foot or bike and always keeping a look out for vulnerable road user for government this mean implementing widespread mph speed limit in town city and village one of the most effective measure identified by the world health organisation to reduce pedestrian casualty julie townsend deputy chief executive brake said the thousand of kid out on the street yesterday should send a clear message to everyone kid want to be able to get out and walk and cycle and by not making our street safe we are denying them the fun active childhood they deserve this ha serious implication for their longterm health and wellbeing the burden on our nh the environment and our society a a whole if we are going to create an environment fit for our child we need to put them not motor vehicle first we are appealing to driver to slow down to mph or le around home school and shop to local authority to continue rolling out mph limit and to national government to make mph the national urban default we need to make sure our kid and people of all age not just the lucky few can walk and cycle without being endangered richard evans campaign spokesperson for road safety at said child want to be active and it our responsibility a road user to ensure they feel safe being able to cycle or walk to and from school should be a childhood right not a luxury we want yesterday event to work a a wakeup call to driver child want their road to be safe and it our privilege at webuyanycarcom to help the voice of over child be heard,"['spokesperson', 'everyday', 'wellbeing', 'webuyanycarcom', 'obesity', 'cycling', 'pedestrian', 'bus', 'traffic', 'charity']"

First World War project for children launched by curriculum experts – Education Today,"['News', 'Teaching resources']","June 9, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/first-world-war-project-for-children-launched-by-curriculum-experts/,"‘The war to end all wars’ is the subject of a new free project being launched this week by creative curriculum writers, Cornerstones Education. Fallen Fields has been designed to help school children study World War One in its centenary year.
Primary schools across the country – whether they already work with Cornerstones or not – are being offered the free teaching and learning resource via the educational supplier’s website.
Teachers will be able to use the project to help children learn about the causes and effects of the conflict sparked by Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s assassination on June 28th 1914.
Cornerstones curriculum director Melanie Moore said: “The First World War was called the ‘war to end all wars’ and its massive historical significance is being commemorated all over this country this year in its 100th anniversary. Children will be seeing a great deal about it on television and in their communities.
“We want to help schools plan and prepare learning experiences which will enable pupils to investigate every aspect of the First World War in a sensitive and thoughtful way.”
The limited-edition project aimed at ten and eleven-year olds (Upper Key Stage 2) will help teachers plan a wide range of cross-curricular learning opportunities.
Fallen Fields includes facts and figures about the First World War, as well as many suggestions for activities such as trips to war memorials and museums, online research to find old newsreel footage and photographs and interviews with family members to ask if they have stories passed down about the 1914-1918 conflict.
It encourages pupils to work together to create timelines, maps and newspaper articles; to plant poppies and to study war poems, paintings and songs. The project even provides a step-by-step guide to help the children organise their own Remembrance Day commemoration event.
Melanie said: “It is important younger generations develop knowledge and understanding of this hugely significant and complex period in our history and we are offering this dedicated project free to all schools to help them get the most out of this learning experience.”
The Fallen Fields project follows the creative learning format of all Cornerstones imaginative learning projects which means it is designed to help children think for themselves; encouraging them to engage, develop, innovate and express themselves, while at the same time meeting all learning requirements of the new National Curriculum 2014.
The free sample project also includes access to ready-made learning resources prepared by Cornerstones such as presentations, song lyrics and maps as well as images, poems and website links.
Fallen Fields is also suitable for Year 7 pupils at secondary school.

Inaugural Beanstalk Ball raises over £170K for children’s literacy charity Beanstalk  – Education Today,"['Literacy', 'News']","June 6, 2014",https://www.education-today.co.uk/inaugural-beanstalk-ball-raises-over-170k-for-childrens-literacy-charity-beanstalk/,"Over 200 people who could read and write, including one guest who learnt to read at 25, attended and supported a charity ball at the May Fair Hotel on Monday 2nd June. Over £170,000 was raised in total in aid of Beanstalk, an exceptional children’s literacy charity. The event was sponsored by wealth management firm Vestra Wealth LLP, without whose personal support the event could not have taken place.
Speakers included HRH Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands, UNESCO’s Special Envoy on Literacy for Development, Boris Johnson, Mayor of London and the charity’s ambassador and author Paul Connolly.
Beanstalk is also extremely fortunate to have as their patron, The Duchess of Cornwall. As a mother and grandmother, she is extremely familiar with the energy and expertise that Beanstalk generates to help tackle illiteracy in the classroom.
The ball, a first for the charity, aims to continue raising money for its work in supporting children who struggle to read. Last year Beanstalk’s worked with 7,350 children across England in over 1,100 schools through the help of over 2,300 reading helpers. The charity aims to help 18,000 children struggling with their reading by 2018 and urgently needs more volunteers.
Following a champagne reception, guests enjoyed a delicious dinner with a whirlwind of magical entertainment, under the aegis of Toby Young, founder of the West London Free School and Master of Ceremonies. As ever, Lord Archer was a superb auctioneer and spun his own magic to elicit some fantastic bids!
Sue Porto, Beanstalk’s CEO, said: “It was fabulous to witness the fantastic generosity and spirit on the night. Funds raised will help to drive the charity forward so that we can reach out to more children, to ensure that no child grows up without the skills they need to read, grow and succeed.”
David Scott, founding and senior partner of Vestra Wealth, said: “We are proud supporters of Beanstalk, having started a four-year commitment as their corporate partner in 2011. We decided to sponsor tonight’s function to ensure that all the money raised could go directly to Beanstalk. We hope that you will join us in supporting a very worthwhile charity that will change many lives and give young people a foundation to build on.”
Guest of honour HRH Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands called upon Mayor Boris Johnson to team up “on a European bicycle tour” with Beanstalk and herself as the founder of the Reading and Writing Foundation to expand the success of the ‘Get London Reading’  campaign across other European countries.
She said: “Time has come for such a campaign since it is a shocking fact that even today one out of every five Europeans – both adults and young people – does not have the literacy skills to participate fully in society. Only joint commitment across society, ages and political timetables can create the literate environment and the quality of learning we need to ensure people are happy, healthy and employable.”
Boris Johnson responded very positively to the invitation of the Princess, embracing her wish to raise awareness on literacy. Boris shared a personal anecdote of being left behind in the reading stakes when, at the age of six, he was told that his younger sister Rachel was a better reader. With typical insouciance, Boris blamed the reading material (Peter and Jane) and revealed it was ‘The Cat in the Hat’ that inspired his love of reading.
The Mayor also said: “I want every child in London to leave school with the ability to read and although the situation is improving, still 1 in 5 children finish school without the basic literacy skills necessary to set them up for life. Through my education programme we are working to raise attainment levels further and charities like Beanstalk have a vital role to play.”
“I am delighted to see how much money has been raised by Beanstalk’s recent charity ball, which will help hundreds more children, and I hope supporters continue to dig deep to ensure the continuation of this excellent work.”
